My Sassy Girl
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
We promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
I'm going to wait.
Here we go.
Please, don't move.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Sorry, I'm on my way.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm having my photo taken.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
He hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm a real man now.
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
Who's interrupting me?
Hello?
Who is this?
- Your mother, you bastard.
- Oh, mom...
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
I'm leaving soon.
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
It's been over a year since you saw her.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
She'll be so glad to see you.
Still there?
We don't look alike.
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Don't wear pink.
Honey!
She call him honey!
I'm not...
What are you doing!
I'm not...
You handle this!
I'm not...
Think I'm stupid?
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Why didn't you look after her?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Nothing's there when you need it.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Wow, your honey's wasted.
No, it's not my fault.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
You see, we're engaged.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
It's 40,000 won, kid.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770...
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
This phone's owner?
She's sleeping beside me.
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
No, I'm not, sir!
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please, forgive me just this once.
Please, forgive me.
I can't get in there...
How are you?
Please, please, save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please, just for once!
Please...
See you!
What's your name?
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
What brought you here?
I'm innocent.
I'm telling the truth, sir!
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
No, I don't mean that!
That's exactly what you said, motherfucker!
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, he told you... you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
I'm home.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
Your aunt said you didn't come!
And you're telling me a lie!
What happened to your sweater?
I'm such a poor guy.
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
Since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Who's calling?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry Jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almond's good, too.
I'll just have a Love Me.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
Well, it's...
You were drunk, so...
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
That's right.
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
That's right.
Would you believe that, too?
To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
- Sorry, it's late.
- Yeah...
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not.
Then are you hitting on me?
I don't wanna date you.
We're not destined for each other.
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
I think she's a heavy drinker.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
Let's go somewhere fun later.
I know what that means.
- A motel?
Are you rich?
- Of course.
How much will you give us?
We'll see, so don't worry.
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Show me your ID.
You, too.
What's with you?
Show it, now.
This sucks.
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
- Don't you have a daughter?
- I don't.
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
- How dare you?
- Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
I'll show you.
Don't live like that!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please, stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But, mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
- What!
What is it?
- Uh!
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
I'm sorry, but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
- Then talk like friends.
- Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
That's how our relationship began.
Lee Hyung-chul.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
I'm here!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu Seol-soo.
Yes, I'm here.
Professor.
How about a break?
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's go.
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?
Let's go.
I can't.
I can't miss this class.
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
She's pretty.
Pretty?
Doesn't matter.
A girl needs to act pretty.
- But she's still pretty.
- Nice body, too.
Who's Gyeon-woo?
It's me, sir.
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
What?
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
Don't wear the same color as mine!
The heroine is tough, like the "Terminator".
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
I don't know why.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.
You don't know movies.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
"Shower" by Hwang Sun-won.
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Koreans like sad movies all because of "Shower".
"Shower"?
What's sad about it?
It's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
I couldn't sleep for one week.
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Their family line is broken up now.
But, you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please, bury me with my loving friend.
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Don't!
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?
I must be hurt still.
I think I'll never get over him.
How deep could it be?
I don't know.
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
Wow, it's deep.
I can't swim!
Yes, it's deep...
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
- Really?
- I'm serious.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She's really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
- Are you free?
- Hey?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly there is a runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.
One hour ago It's me.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Can't I join us, can I?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Now, you're dead.
Excuse me...
You've just forgotten your things.
Oh, my gosh!
It's kind of you, thanks.
Do you want me to hold it for you?
- Oh, no.
That's all right.
- All right then.
I'll help you, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
- Get up, bastard!
- What the...
How're you?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
- What officer?
- Keep quiet.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
- Hey.
Want some of this?
- No, thanks.
Try it.
It's delicious.
- No.
- Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
- Keep quiet!
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You bastard!
Do that again, and you're dead.
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
It's so delicious.
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Be good to me... and you'll always be with good luck.
If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the Internet.
- Go to bed now.
- You too, dad.
- All right, good night!
- Good night.
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?
No, I do.
Time for bed.
- Go to sleep.
- Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this.
*^____________.^*
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
- Jump over here?
- Yeah.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
It's my birthday, not yours.
Please, let's just try.
I'll go up first and help you.
Eh?
There's a step here.
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Wait till I catch you.
Why didn't you answer?
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Yes.
- Answer quietly!
- Yes.
Is that a real gun?
- Wanna see?
- Forget it.
How are you two related?
We're just friends.
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apologize!
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
- Tell me the truth, idiot.
- Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
While I'm in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Don't know.
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
- That's why you shouldn't be foolish.
- Why?
Am I foolish?
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
I know.
I know, too.
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
She'll never be the same.
You're wrong.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
I'll always think of her there.
What does "can" mean?
It means prison.
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
- Go!
- Let's go together.
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
You'll come out safely.
You're leaving me alone?
There's no other way.
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
Oh, right.
Over there, there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
You're not tricking me, right?
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
I'll give you an hour!
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
- Got it?
- Hurry up!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
Hey, soldier!
I mean... sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
I think you didn't.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
If not, then it's not love.
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Stop this, and go back to the base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
If you do, I'll take her.
- Can I go?
- Go.
Screw it.
Shit!
Don't know.
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
What?
We're just friends?
No, I said that to save you.
"Let me go, instead?"
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
He wouldn't have let you go.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
What's up?
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
- I like her that way.
- What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
It's nothing.
Looks fun, huh?
- Another one?
- Why?
Don't wanna read it?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
I'll read it.
This time it's a martial arts film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo?
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the King's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup!
The heroine becomes a King.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
It's fun, huh?
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
If it's possible...
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Well... this is "The Warrior's Sad Love Story"...
It's going to be a hit.
Shin Cine didn't... call back.
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
What's the prize?
Let's see...
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
Someone's coming.
I think this is unfair.
I'm a girl, so I'll slap the cheek.
No.
Then I'll change it, too.
- But I'm a girl.
- Men and women are equal.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Go easy on me, and I'll kill you.
Better slap me on the cheek.
If you don't, I'll kill you!
All right.
You slap, and I'll use my finger.
Right, that's fair.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
It'll be the right foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Nope.
It's for me!
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea?
- Because of you.
- That's correct!
And why you were born here?
- It's for me as well.
- What?
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
You know the word "worship"?
"Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus," huh?
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
My mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
Want a massage?
No, it's okay.
Instead, let's exchange shoes.
Don't wanna?
How can a guy wear heels?
It'll fit.
But, I can't...
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
I'll buy you some sneakers.
Forget it.
Then wear mine, and I'll carry yours.
You don't understand women.
Okay!
Let's exchange.
Really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
I don't wear panties on exam day.
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
If you don't, I'll kill you.
- Phew...
- Catch me, honey...!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
That's my house.
Wait.
I'll bring you an umbrella.
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'll just leave.
Eh?
Gee...
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Next time, don't hang out till late.
You don't understand me.
Why'd you stand him up?
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
He's dumb and has no future.
It's none of your business.
Why is he stupid?
You're stupid so you don't know.
What has gotten into you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a long time.
- Hello?
- Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
It's 100 days already?
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
No, I'm just kidding.
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
What's your favorite song?
That George Winston song.
Pachelbel Canon?
Yeah, that song.
You're not gonna ask me?
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
Still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Oh, my God!
A burglar!
Help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
What on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
Why you didn't drop by your aunt's, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
I'm cleverer than I look.
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I'm delivering Chinese food.
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Really?
Bring a lot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
There's another customer.
Hey!
But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
Feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?
It's a suspension!
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Let's prevent AIDS.
Taxi!
She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Sir?
Right.
It's a condom.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
But I haven't used it yet.
- Actually, on the way here.
- Forget it.
"Chicks Hen"?
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
"We'll satisfy all your wishes?"
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
"Hurry and tell him."
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Please, don't worry.
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Don't see her any more.
After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We've broken up.
Now, I'm free.
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
I'm on a date with a girl.
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
"Gotta go to the bathroom."
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
- Same here.
- Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
I'll drink coffee.
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
I heard a lot about you.
That you're a close friend.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
This necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
You wouldn't wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.
Considering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn't get over him.
Does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world.
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him...
Doesn't look bad, does he?
Yes.
Hey, listen!
I'm totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.
A man likes something more feminine.
And... don't drink a lot.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once don't try to win.
Good luck to you.
Where's Gyeon-woo?
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
She'll beat someone.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
She'll like it a lot.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If she says she'll kill you... don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
...please, use the next train.
What's his name?
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo!
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
It's me, dad.
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
What's that?
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
And two years later, let's meet here again.
We'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two.
Okay?
We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Let's separate here.
Should we go together?
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
That's how we broke up.
Overtime
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yup!
Excuse me.
I wrote "My Sassy Girl".
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
It's a mystery.
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
What's your secret?
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
But I couldn't come.
I guess you're a year late.
But two years didn't seem that long.
I haven't made any decision yet.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
People are dead or alive.
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
Know how long it's been?
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
I don't have to go now.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

(Click)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
Friend 1 :
He hasn't changed at all.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm a real man now.
Friend 2:
Hey, asshole.
Friend 1 :
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
Gyeon-woo:
You irritate me!
Gyeon-woo:
Give me a break, asshole.
Gyeon-woo:
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Friend 1 :
Who are you kidding?
Friend 2:
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
(Cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:(In anger) Who's interrupting me?
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Who is this?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Your mother, you bastard.
/Gyeon-woo:
Oh, mom...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm leaving soon.
Gyeon-woo:
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Friends:
Talk over there!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Make sure you pay a visit.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
It's been over a year since you saw her.
Gyeon-woo:
That long?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She says you resemble him.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'll be so glad to see you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Still there?
Gyeon-woo:
We don't look alike.
Gyeon-woo:
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Gyeon-woo:
Uncle does, too.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
Gyeon-woo:
I know the type she likes.
Gyeon-woo:
Tell her no thanks.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day... (Train arriving)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Girl:
Hey, get up!
Girl:
Offer your seat to the elder!
Man:
Ugh!
Girl:
Go!
Girl:
Hey.
Girl:
Don't wear pink.
(Girl feeling like vomiting)
(She swallows at a gulp)
(Gyeon-woo's disgusted at the sight)
(She throws up)
(People around them in commotion)
Girl:
Honey!
People:
She calls him honey!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
Old man:
What are you doing!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
Old man:
You handle this!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
Old man:
Think I'm stupid?
Old man:
Come here!
Old man:
Are you laughing?
Old man:
Why didn't you look after her?
Old man:
Hurry and do something!
Old man:(ln a rage) What are you doing?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Old man:
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Nothing's there when you need it.
Gyeon-woo:
Where did all those motels go?
Gyeon-woo:
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Gyeon-woo:
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Innkeeper:(Sarcastically) Wow, your honey wasted.
Gyeon-woo:
No, it's not my fault.
Innkeeper:
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Gyeon-woo:
You see, we're engaged.
Innkeeper:
Western or Korean style?
Gyeon-woo:
Give me any room.
Innkeeper:
Room 405.
Gyeon-woo:
None on the first floor?
Innkeeper:
Fourth floor!
(Knock on the door)
Innkeeper:
You forgot to check in.
Innkeeper:
It's 40,000 won, kid.
Gyeon-woo:
What?
40,000 won?
Innkeeper:
Why?
Find another place then.
Gyeon-woo:
Count it.
Innkeeper:624... 770
Innkeeper:
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
Innkeeper:016... 228... 53...
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, please...
Innkeeper:
A thousand won left!
(Her cellular phone ringing during his shower bath)
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Gyeon-woo:
This phone's owner?
Gyeon-woo:
She's sleeping beside me.
Gyeon-woo:
What?
Here?
Gyeon-woo:
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
(Phone's cut off)
Gyeon-woo:
Better wash and leave fast.
(Gyeon-woo's amazed at his own looks in the mirror) Aha~!
(The door's opened with a bang)
Woman cop 1 :
Hands in the air!
Woman cop 1 :
What are you doing?
Woman cop 1 :
Hands in the air!
Gyeon-woo:
Aaggh~~~~~~!
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm not, sir!
Gyeon-woo:
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Policeman:
Talk about it later and get in there.
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Policeman:
Come over here.
Come on!
Gyeon-woo:
Please forgive me just this once.
Gyeon-woo:
Please forgive me.
I can't get in there...
Gangsters:
How are you?
Gyeon-woo:
Please, please save my life!
Gangsters:

How are you?
Gyeon-woo:
Please just for once!
Please...
Gangsters:

Boss:
What's your name?
Gangster:
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
Gangster:
What brought you here?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm innocent.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm telling the truth, sir!
Gangster:
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I don't mean that!
Gangster:
That's exactly what you said, motherfucker!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
Gangster:
You raped a girl, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Nope!
No~~~!
Gangster:
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
Gangster:
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Gangster:
Be quick, he told you, you little bastard!
Gangster:
You turn against him, or what?
Boss:
All of you.
Boss:
Eat one a piece, okay?
Gangsters:
Yes, boss.
Gangster 2:
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Policeman 1 :
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Gyeon-woo:
Take care you guys!
Gangster:
Bye~!
Gangster:
And remember to keep in touch!
Gyeon-woo:
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Gangster:
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Gyeon-woo:
Of course.
See you.
Boss:
Hey!
You come over here.
Boss:
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm home.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Did you go to Bupyung?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, I did.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Come here!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Where did you sleep?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Your aunt said you didn't come!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
And you're telling me a lie!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What happened to your sweater?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I'm such a poor guy.
All this cause of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
Gyeon-woo:(Running away) You asked if I went to Bupyung!
Gyeon-woo:
I did, but not to see auntie!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from me,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Up four points in three years.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Call this a report card?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from your mom,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'll get good grades if you study harder.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
(Gyeon-woo's cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Girl:
Who are you, asshole?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
Who's calling?
Girl:
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
Girl:
Come out!
Girl:
To Bupyung station now!
Gyeon-woo:
Uh...
(Cell phone hangs up)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Gyeon-woo:(Hesitating) Excuse me.
Girl:
Is it you?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes?
Girl:
Follow me.
Girl:
Get over here.
Girl:
What do you wanna eat?
Gyeon-woo:
Cherry Jubilee...
Gyeon-woo:
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Gyeon-woo:
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
Gyeon-woo:
I'll just have a Love Me.
Girl:
Hey, wanna die?
Girl:
Drink coffee.
Girl:
Two coffees.
Girl:
You pay for it.
Girl:
Tell me.
Girl:
What happened last night?
Gyeon-woo:(Stammering) Well, it's...
Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk, so...
Girl:
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
Gyeon-woo:
I saved you from the train.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
Girl:
So I called you honey?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
Girl:
I kind of remember that.
Girl:
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat,
Girl:and the police came?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
Girl:
Would you believe that, too?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
Girl:
So I did that, right?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, you did.
Waitress:(Serving coffee) Sorry, it's late.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah...
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
Gyeon-woo:
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Girl:
Are you mocking me?
Gyeon-woo:(Embarrassed) No, I'm not.
Girl:
Then are you hitting on me?
Girl:(Directly) I don't wanna date you.
Girl:
We're not destined for each other.
Girl:
Throw the trash away.
Gyeon-woo:(Feeling absurd) Damn it.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I think she's a heavy drinker.
Girl:
You order.
Gyeon-woo:
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Girl:(Throwing a menu card) Eat Golbangee.
Gyeon-woo:(Grumbling) Then you should order.
Girl:(Girl in anger) Stop pouting!
Girl:
Golbangee, please.
Man 1 :

Teenage girl 1 :

Teenage girl 1 :
A motel?
Are you rich?

Of course.
Teenage girl 1 :
How much will you give us?
Man 2:
We'll see, so don't worry.
Girl:
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Girl:
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
Teenage girl 1 :
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
Man 1 :
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
Girl:
You take friends to a motel?
Girl:
How old are you kids?
Teenage girl 2:
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Girl:
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Girl:
Show me your ID.
You, too.
Teenage girl 1 :
What's with you?
Girl:
Show it, now.
Teenage girl 1 :
This sucks.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Man 2:
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
Girl:
Don't you have a daughter?
/Man 2:
I don't.
Bear me one.
Girl:
Who the hell do you think you are?
Man 2:
How dare you?
/Girl:
Come on, let's fight!
Girl:
Come on!
I'll show you.
Girl:
Don't live like that!
Man 1 :
Catch the girls.
Gyeon-woo:(Pouring soju) Have a drink and calm down.
Girl:(Keeping drinking) Shit!
Girl:
Ah~!
Girl:(Sobbing out) Huk~!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Girl:
Did you blow your nose on this?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
Girl:(Girl starting to cry) Huk~ huk~ huk~~~!
Gyeon-woo:
Please stop crying.
Gyeon-woo:
Also...
Gyeon-woo:
The handkerchief is mine.

Girl:
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
Gyeon-woo:
Wake up.
Gyeon-woo:
Come on, wake up.
Innkeeper:
Your fiances wasted again?
Gyeon-woo:
What now?
Innkeeper:
Sign you in like before, right?
Gyeon-woo:

Gyeon-woo:
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
Innkeeper:
No, you buy it.
Woman:
Where did you go, honey?
Woman:(ln amazement) Ugh~!
Ooh~!
Man:
What!
What is it?
/Gyeon-woo:
Uh!
Girl:(Girl vomiting) Ooh-ack!
Gyeon-woo:(Gyeon-woo feeling sick at the girl) Ack!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Girl:
Give me some water.
Girl:(Getting up) Hey.
Girl:
Why am I here?
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry,
Gyeon-woo:but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
Gyeon-woo:
If you talk down on me again...
Girl:
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Gyeon-woo:
Nothing.
Girl:
Give me the towel.
Gyeon-woo:
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
Girl:
Then talk like friends.
/Gyeon-woo:

Toothbrush.
Gyeon-woo:
Toothpaste?
Gyeon-woo:
In the bathroom.

But she's still pretty.
/Friend 2:

I said leave.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
Professor:
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
(Friends' jeer)
Professor:
So go see her.
(Friends' jeer again)
Gyeon-woo:
Thank you, sir.
Professor:
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
Professor:
If you can, raise it with her.

Gyeon-woo:
What did you tell him?
Girl:
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
Girl:
What?
Gyeon-woo:(Screaming) No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Girl:
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
Gyeon-woo:
I will.
Girl:(flying into a rage) Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Girl:
Pick it up!
Girl:
And why did you wear that color?
Man on the street:
Then what about you?
Girl:
Don't wear the same color as mine!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.

To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.

You don't know movies.
Gyeon-woo:
Koreans like melodramas.
Girl:
Why?
Gyeon-woo:
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Gyeon-woo:'Shower' by Hwang Sun-won.
Gyeon-woo:
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Gyeon-woo:
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.
Girl:'Shower'?
What's sad about it?
Gyeon-woo:
It's sad when she asked
Gyeon-woo:to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
Gyeon-woo:
I couldn't sleep for one week.
Girl:
The ending sucks.
Girl:
Gotta change it.
Gyeon-woo:
How?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Their family line is broken up now.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
This was her last request.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:(Surprised) What?

I think I'll never get over him.
Girl:
How deep could it be?
Gyeon-woo:
I don't know.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
Girl:
I wanna know how deep it is.
Gyeon-woo:

Taxi driver:
Hey, money!
Girl:
Ooh!
Damn it!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
(On the air) This stop is Bupyung station...
Cleaning Lady:
Hey, kid.

Girl:
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Girl:
Be good to me...
Girl:and you'll always be with good luck.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) lf I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hands.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick.
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
(The sound of fulling cloth)
Gyeon-woo's Father:
You studying now?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the Internet.

Girl:
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this.
* * ____
Girl:
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:
I got it.
Gyeon-woo:(Sigh) Phew~~
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
(Laughing)
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Girl:
Jump over here?
/Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
We have to.
Gyeon-woo:
I always wanted to come here at night.
Girl:
It's my birthday, not yours.
Gyeon-woo:
Please, let's just try.
Gyeon-woo:
I'll go up first and help you.
Gyeon-woo:
Eh?
There's a step here.
Gyeon-woo:
Take my hand.
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, shit!
(Tumbling down)
Gyeon-woo:
Shit!
(Surprised at a deserter)
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Girl:
Hey!
Girl:
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Girl:
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Girl:
Wait till I catch you.
Girl:
Why didn't you answer?
Girl:
Wanna die?
Deserter:
Come with me!
(The sound of car passing by)
Deserter:
Hurry and get in.
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
Deserter:
Shut up!
Deserter:
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Deserter:
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) Yes.
Deserter:
Answer quietly!
/Gyeon-woo:(quietly) Yes.
(Gyeon-woo startled at her)
Girl:
Is that a real gun?
Deserter:
Wanna see?
/Girl:
Forget it.
Deserter:
How are you two related?
Gyeon-woo:
We're just friends.
Deserter:
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
Girl:
What?
Your pussy?
Girl:
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apologize!
Deserter:
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Deserter:
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Deserter:
Why are you here?
Gyeon-woo:(Stammering) We just wanted to come here at night.
Deserter:
Tell me the truth, idiot.
/Gyeon-woo:
Nothing special.
Deserter:
Bullshit.
Deserter:
What makes you trust a guy like him?
Girl:
I trusted myself.
Deserter:(Sigh) I had a girlfriend, too.
Deserter:
She visited me every week for one year.
Deserter:
I was so happy.
Deserter:
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
Deserter:
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Deserter:(Sobbing) Damn it.
Deserter:
While I'm in the service, even my dog...
Deserter:ran away with some mutt, too.
Deserter:
My Yorkshire Terrier.
Bitch.
Deserter:
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
Deserter:
I have the worst luck in this world.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Deserter:
Know what special day is it today?
Deserter:
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
(A deserter screaming)
(As if feeling sick) Uuuuuuuhhh~ ack!
Girl:
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Gyeon-woo:
Don't know.
Girl:
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
Girl:
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Deserter:
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Deserter:
Stop joking around.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Damn it!
Deserter:
Even you bastards ignore me.
Girl:
That's why don't be foolish.
/Deserter:
Why am I foolish?
Girl:
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
Deserter:
I know.
I know, too.
Deserter:
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
Deserter:
She'll never be the same.
Girl:
You're wrong.
Girl:
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
Deserter:
You went through something like this?
Girl:
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Deserter:
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
Deserter:
I'll always think of her there.
Girl:
What does 'can' mean?
Gyeon-woo:
It means prison.
Deserter:
Don't interrupt.
/Gyeon-woo:
Sorry.
Girl:
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, sir.
Gyeon-woo:
How about letting her go?
Deserter:
If I say no?
Gyeon-woo:
Then...
Gyeon-woo:...
let me go, instead.
Deserter:
Come to think of it,
Deserter:your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
Deserter:
You act like him, too.
Deserter:
You can go.
Deserter:
And you...
Deserter:
We die together.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:
Pardon?
Deserter:
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Deserter:
Go!
/Girl:
let's go together.
Girl:
All three of us.
Deserter:
Will you leave if I kill him?
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
Girl:
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
Girl:
You'll come out safely.
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) You're leaving me alone?
Girl:
There's no other way.
Deserter:
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
(The sound of radio signal)
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
Gyeon-woo:
Over there,
Gyeon-woo:there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Gyeon-woo:
Nobody knows about it.
Gyeon-woo:
I used to work here.
Deserter:
Really?
Deserter:
You're not tricking me, right?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Deserter:
Walk in front of me.
Gyeon-woo:
See?
I told you so.
(The radio signal)
Soldier 1 :
This way!
Deserter:
Shit!

Friend 1 :
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Deserter:
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
Deserter:
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!

Deserter:
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
Deserter:
I'll give you an hour!
Deserter:
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
Deserter:
Got it?

Hurry up!
Radio:
Sniper 2!
Sniper:
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
(Shooting)
Girl:
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
(The radio signal still going on)
Girl:
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Girl:
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Girl:
Did you really love her?
Girl:
Ask yourself.
Girl:
I think you didn't.
Girl:
If you really love her,
Girl:you should let her go.
Girl:
If not, then it's not love.
Girl:
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Girl:
Stop this,
Girl:and go back to base as a real man.
Girl:
A person like you should learn more about love.
Girl:(Crying)If we want to learn,
Girl:then we should keep living.
Deserter:(Crying) Damn it.
Deserter:
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Deserter:
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
Deserter:
If you do, I'll take her.
Gyeon-woo:
Can I go?
/Deserter:
Go.
Screw it.
Friend 1 :
Shit!
Don't know.
(Fireworking) Pop!
Pop!
Deserter:
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
Deserter:
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
Girl:
What?
We're just friends?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I said that to save you.
Girl:
let me go, instead?
Girl:
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
He wouldn't have let you go.
Girl:
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Girl:
Have a nice life alone.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
Waiter:
I remember.
Waiter:
She always came with him until last year.
Waiter:
Was it last spring or autumn?
Waiter:
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
Waiter:
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
Girl:
What's up?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, hi.
Girl:
You're early.
Gyeon-woo:
I was in the neighborhood.
Girl:
Miss me?
Gyeon-woo:
Of course!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She always tried hard to look cheerful.
Gyeon-woo:
I like her that way.
/Waiter:
What would you like?
Gyeon-woo:
Coke, please.
Girl:
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Girl:
Two coffees, please.
(Gyeon-woo grinning) He he he~
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
Girl:
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
It's nothing.
Girl:
looks fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Another one?
/Girl:
Why?
Don't wanna read it?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She may get disappointed,
Gyeon-woo:but I should be honest for her sake.
Gyeon-woo:
looks fun.
I'll read it.
(Girl laughing brightly) Ha ha ha~
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
(People around a montage in commotion)
Man 1 :
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Man 2:
Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo:
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
(Cunningly laugh) He he he~
(Gyeon-woo screaming and running for her) Yaaaah~
(Girl drawing a sword) Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
Girl:
It's fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Girl:
Science is advanced then,
Girl:so they invent a time machine.
Girl:
And people go to the past to travel.
Girl:
People from the future could be here now.
Girl:
I think UFOs are time machines.
Girl:
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
Girl:
I have to.
Gyeon-woo:
If you do, ask him to take you.
Girl:
What?
Gyeon-woo:
If it's possible...
Girl:
Give this to Shin Cine.
Girl:
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Girl:
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Gyeon-woo:
Well... this is 'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...
(Man feeling like vomiting) Uuuuuuuugh~
(Man throwing up) Uuuh~ Aaaack~!
Gyeon-woo:
It's going to be a hit.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Shin Cine didn't call back.
Girl:
Hey!
Girl:
Hey, kid.
Girl:
Is the subway your sketch book?
Girl:
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
Woman:
My lipstick!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Girl:
left foot over the line, I win.
Girl:
With the right foot, you win.
Gyeon-woo:
What's the prize?
Girl:
let's see...
Gyeon-woo:
How about a kiss?
Girl:(ln a loud voice) A kiss?
Girl:
Wanna die?
Gyeon-woo:
You choose.
Girl:
Hitting each other.
Gyeon-woo:
Again?
Girl:
You can hit me, too.
Gyeon-woo:
Okay.
Gyeon-woo:
Someone's coming.
(Gyeon-woo laughing) Ha ha ha~~~~~!
Girl:
I think this is unfair.
Girl:
I'm a girl, so I'll slap the cheek.
Gyeon-woo:
No.
Then I'll change it, too.
Girl:
But I'm a girl.
/Gyeon-woo:
Men and women are equal.
Girl:
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Girl:
Go easy on me, and I'll kill you.
Girl:
Better slap me on the cheek.
Girl:
If you don't, I'll kill you!
Gyeon-woo:
All right.
Gyeon-woo:
You slap, and I'll use my finger.
Girl:
Right, that's fair.
Girl:
Saw that?
Girl:
See that guy step over with his left foot?
Gyeon-woo:
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.
Gyeon-woo:
I thought it was this way.
Girl:
Shut up.
Here they come.
A staff sergeant:
left foot.
Left foot.
Gyeon-woo:
It'll be the right foot.
A staff sergeant:
left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
Gyeon-woo:
You have to hit me?
Girl:
You know why the sky is blue?
Gyeon-woo:'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Girl:
Nope.
It's for me!
Girl:
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
Girl:
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
Girl:
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
Girl:
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
Gyeon-woo:
Because of you.
/Girl:
That's correct!
Girl:
And why you were born here?
Girl:
It's for me as well.
/Gyeon-woo:
What?
Gyeon-woo:
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
Girl:
You know the word of 'worship'?
Girl:'Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus.' huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Well...
Yeah, I know.
Girl:
So, get ready!
Girl:
Come here.
Stay still.
/Gyeon-woo:
Ugh!
Uh uh uh~!
(Passengers surprised)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
Girl:
What?
Girl:
What are you looking at?
Gyeon-woo:
I quit!
Girl:
Is your face a racket?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
(Gyeon-woo screaming) Ugh~!
(Shouting)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
(Gyeon-woo screaming and running) Aaaaaaaaah~!
(Gyeon-woo groaning) Ugh!
Gyeon-woo:
Wait long?
Girl:
Just a teeny bit.
Girl:
My mom bought me these heels,
Girl:but they're killing my feet.
Gyeon-woo:
Want a massage?
Girl:
No, it's okay.
Girl:
Instead, let's exchange shoes.
Girl:
Don't wanna?
Gyeon-woo:
How can a guy wear heels?
Girl:
It'll fit.
Gyeon-woo:
But, I can't...
Girl:
Yeah?
I see.
Gyeon-woo:
Come on.
I'll buy you some sneakers.
Girl:
Forget it.
Gyeon-woo:
Then wear mine, and I'll carry yours.
Girl:
You don't understand women.
Gyeon-woo:
Okay!
Let's exchange.
Girl:
Really?
Girl:
Wanna know a secret?
Gyeon-woo:
What is it?
Girl:
I don't wear panties on exam day.
Girl:
But I had one today.
Girl:
Catch me, honey!
Girl:
Hey.
If you don't, I'll kill you.
Gyeon-woo:
Phew~ /Girl:
Catch me, honey~!
Gyeon-woo:
Stop right there!
Gyeon-woo:
Stop!
Umpire:
Out!
Gyeon-woo:(monolog) It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
Girl:
That's my house.
Girl:
Wait.
I'll bring you an umbrella.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'll just leave.
Gyeon-woo:
Eh?
Gee~
Girl's Father:
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, sir.
Girl's Father:
How much do you know about my daughter?
Gyeon-woo:
Not much...
Girl's Father:
Next time, don't hang out till late.
Girl's Mom:
You don't understand me.
Girl's Mom:
Why'd you stand him up?
Girl's Mom:
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
Girl's Mom:
And what happened to your heels?
Girl's Mom:
What's wrong with you?
Girl's Mom:
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
Girl's Mom:
He's dumb and has no future.
Girl:
It's none of your business.
Girl:
Why is he stupid?
Girl:
You're stupid so you don't know.
Girl's Mom:
What has gotten in to you?
Girl:
let me live my own life!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a long time.
(Cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
/Girl:
Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Girl:
long time no see.
Gyeon-woo:
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Girl:
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
Gyeon-woo:
It's 100 days already?
Girl:
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
Gyeon-woo:
When a sexy woman is naked.
Girl:
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm just kidding.
Gyeon-woo:
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
Girl:
What's your favorite song?
Gyeon-woo:
That George Winston song.
(Gyeon-woo humming) Ta la la la la la~ Ta la~~~
Girl:
Pachelbel's 'Canon'?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, that song.
Girl:
You're not gonna ask me?
Gyeon-woo:
When is the guy the prettiest?
Girl:
Just give me a rose.
Girl:
Still have your high school uniform?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Why?
Girl:
Bring it on our 100th day,
Girl:and give me a rose during my class.
Girl:
Do it yourself, okay?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
(Students shouting to be quiet)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Oh my God!
A burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Help, a burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
And you...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm cleverer than I look.
Gyeon-woo:
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Guard:
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm delivering Chinese food.
Guard:
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Gyeon-woo:
Really?
Guard:
Bring a lot of radish?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, I forgot something!
Guard:
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
Gyeon-woo:
There's another customer.
Guard:
Hey!
(Classroom in commotion...) (becoming as silent as death...)
(Again in commotion)
(Pachelbel's 'Canon' begins to be played)
(Students clapping and shouting)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Girl:
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gyeon-woo:
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Gyeon-woo:
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
Gyeon-woo:
Feeling so good!
Girl:
Have a smoke, too!
Gyeon-woo:
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gyeon-woo:
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
Gyeon-woo:
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
Gyeon-woo:
It's a suspension!
Girl:
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Girl:
Go ahead and smoke!
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
Gyeon-woo:
You go to very good school!
Girl:
Not to worry.
Gyeon-woo:
This clothes is so tight!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Condom man:
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Condom man:
let's prevent AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
Taxi!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Girl's Father:
Here.
Girl's Father:
Have any plans after graduation?
Gyeon-woo:
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Girl's Father:
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Gyeon-woo:
Sir?
Right.
(Girl's Mom mumbling without sound) 'lt's a condom.'
Girl's Father:
What is this for?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
But I haven't used it yet.
Gyeon-woo:
Actually, on the way here.
/Girl's Father:
Forget it.
Girl's Father:'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
Girl's Father:'We'll satisfy all your wishes?
'
Gyeon-woo:
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
Girl's Mom:(Without sound) 'Hurry and tell him.'
Girl's Father:
How do feel about our daughter?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Gyeon-woo:
Please don't worry.
Gyeon-woo:
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Girl's Father:
Don't see her any more.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We're broken up.
Now, I'm free.
(Cellular phone ringing)
Girl:
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
Girl:
What?
I have a blind date today.
Girl:
Come in 45 minutes.
Gyeon-woo:
I have a blind date, too.
(Gyeon-woo surprised)
(Cellular phone ringing)
Girl:
Are you on your way?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm on a date with a girl.
Girl:
Hurry up.
Woman:
I have to go to the bathroom.
Gyeon-woo:'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Gyeon-woo:(ln amazement) Eh?
(Gyeon-woo sobbing as he feels mistreated)
Gyeon-woo:
Nice to meet you.
Seok-won:
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Gyeon-woo:
Same here.
/Seok-won:
Have a seat.
Girl:
Were you really with a girl?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I was with a guy.
Waiter:
Can I take your order?
Gyeon-woo:
Coffee, please.
Girl:
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo:
I'll drink coffee.
Seok-won:
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
Seok-won:
I heard a lot about you.
That you're close friend.
Gyeon-woo:
Friend...
Girl:
I need to go to the bathroom.
Girl:
How is he?
Gyeon-woo:
No idea...
but he looks nice.
Gyeon-woo:
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
Girl:
How do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
When you see a new man...
Gyeon-woo:forget about the past, all right?
Girl:
How the hell do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
Gyeon-woo:
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Gyeon-woo:
Considering your temper...
and you...
Gyeon-woo:used to tell that you couldn't get over him.
Gyeon-woo:
Does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world?
Girl:
That man is the one my mom introduced me to meet.
Girl:
She kept pushing me to meet him...
Girl:
Doesn't look bad guy, does he?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, listen!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm totally OK, but you should be obedient to man.
Gyeon-woo:
Man likes something more feminine.
Gyeon-woo:
And... don't drink a lot.
Gyeon-woo:
Some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated.
Gyeon-woo:
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys
Gyeon-woo:try to surrender for just once.
Gyeon-woo:... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
Girl:
Where's Gyeon-woo?
Seok-won:
He left already.
Seok-won:
He told me ten rules to follow.
Seok-won:
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
Seok-won:
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Gyeon-woo:
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
Gyeon-woo:
She'll beat someone.
Gyeon-woo:
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
Gyeon-woo:
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
Gyeon-woo:
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
Gyeon-woo:
On your 100th day together,
Gyeon-woo:give her a rose during her class.
Gyeon-woo:
She'll like it a lot.
Gyeon-woo:
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Gyeon-woo:
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
Gyeon-woo:
If she says she'll kill you,
Gyeon-woo:don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
Gyeon-woo:
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Gyeon-woo:
Finally, she likes to write.
Gyeon-woo:
Encourage her.
(Girl breathing hard)
(Station attendant) Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to here...
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Station attendant:
Step backward on the yellow line...
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:... after passenger's getting off, take in order...
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:...please use the next train.
Station attendant:
What's his name?
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Girl:
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Girl:
Who told you to hug me?
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
Girl:
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
(Doorbell ringing)
Girl's Father:
Who is it?
Girl:
It's me, Dad.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
(Bird twittering around)
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Girl:
See that mountain top?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Girl:
Could someone hear me from there?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Girl:
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
Girl:
If you hear, answer me.
Gyeon-woo:
You want me to go over there?
Girl:
Yeah.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo?
Girl:
Can you hear me?
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
Girl:
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
(Crying)
Girl:
Did you bring your letter?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
What's that?
Girl:
A time capsule.
Girl:
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
Girl:
And two years later, let's meet here again.
Girl:
We'll read the letters that day,
Girl:and maybe we can find an answer then.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Girl:
let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Girl:
let's separate here.
Gyeon-woo:
Should we go together?
Girl:
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
Gyeon-woo:
See you two years later!
Girl:
Okay, in two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Bye!
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) That's how we broke up.
Overtime
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different myself.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
(Gulp... gulp...) (Shouting) Yu~p!
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
(Gyeon-woo crying out in surprise) Wow!
Gyeon-woo:
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo:
It's a mystery.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) After that day, I went often to this place.
Girl:
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Girl:
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Old man:
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Girl:
Do you come here often?
Old man:
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
Girl:
I have a secret here, too.
Old man:
Really?
Girl:
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
Girl:
What's your secret?
Old man:
So what happened?
Girl:
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
Girl:
But I couldn't come.
Old man:
I guess you're a year late.
Girl:
But two years didn't seem that long.
Girl:
I haven't made any decision yet.
Girl:
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Old man:
like what?
Girl:
If we were destined to meet,
Girl:
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Old man:
Know what fate is?
Old man:
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
Old man:
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
Old man:
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Girl:
Yes.
Old man:
look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Girl:
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
Old man:
People are dead or alive.
Old man:
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
Old man:
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
Old man:
It was split into two.
Old man:
But this young man felt sorry for it.
Old man:
During this spring,
Old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
Old man:
When he planted the tree,
Old man:he asked me if it look the same.
Old man:
He said that someone would be sad if it died,
Old man:so no one should know.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo...
(Recorded mechanical voice) You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Girl:
Hi.
Woman:
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
Girl:
You still look young.
How have you been?
Woman:
You were in England?
Girl:
Yes.
For one and a half years.
Girl:
So I can forget him.
Woman:
I see.
Feel better?
Girl:
Yes.
A lot better.
Woman:
Is it true now?
Woman:
My son might be sad.
Girl:
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Woman:
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Gyeon-woo:
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
Auntie:
You naughty boy.
Auntie:
Know how long it's been?
Auntie:
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
Auntie:
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
Auntie:
When you had a hard time,
Auntie:
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,
Auntie:but he kept getting out of it.
Auntie:
Heard you came to Bupyung often,
Auntie:but you never visited me?
Auntie:
Go out with him.
Auntie:
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Auntie:
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
Auntie:
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
Gyeon-woo:
I don't have to go now.
Auntie:
Why?
You two know each other?
Girl:
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
Girl:
From your future.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

MY SASSY GIRL
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
We promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
I'm going to wait.
Here we go.
Please don't move.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Sorry, I'm on my way.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm having my photo taken.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
He hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm a real man now.
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
Who's interrupting me?
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard. /Oh, mom...
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
I'm leaving soon.
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
It's been over a year since you saw her.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
She'll be so glad to see you.
Still there?
We don't look alike.
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Don't wear pink.
Honey!
She call him honey!
I'm not...
What are you doing!
I'm not...
You handle this!
I'm not...
Think I'm stupid?
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Why didn't you look after her?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Nothing's there when you need it.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Wow, your honey's wasted.
No, it's not my fault.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
You see, we're engaged.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
It's 40,000 won, kid.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
This phone's owner?
She's sleeping beside me.
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
No, I'm not, sir!
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please forgive me just this once.
Please forgive me.
I can't get in there...
How are you?
please, please save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please just for once!
Please...
See you!
What's your name?
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
What brought you here?
I'm innocent.
I'm telling the truth, sir!
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
No, I don't mean that!
That's exactly what you said, Motherfucker!
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
I'm home.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
Your aunt said you didn't come!
And you're telling me a lie!
What happened to your sweater?
I'm such a poor guy.
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
Since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Who's calling?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
I'll just have a Love Me.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
Well, it's...
You were drunk, so...
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
That's right.
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
That's right.
Would you believe that, too?
To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
Sorry, it's late. /Yeah...
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not.
Then are you hitting on me?
I don't wanna date you.
We're not destined for each other.
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
I think she's a heavy drinker.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
Let's go somewhere fun later.
I know what that means.
A motel?
Are you rich?
/ Of course.
How much will you give us?
We'll see, so don't worry.
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Show me your ID.
You, too.
What's with you?
Show it, now.
This sucks.
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
Don't you have a daughter?
/ I don't.
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
How dare you?
/Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
I'll show you.
Don't live like that!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What!
What is it?
/ Uh!
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
I'm sorry, but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
Then talk like friends. /Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
That's how our relationship began.
Lee Hyung-chuI.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
I'm here!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu SeoI-soo.
(In a dialect) Yes, I'm here.
Professor.
How about a break?
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's go.
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?
Let's go.
I can't.
I can't miss this class.
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
She's pretty.
Pretty?
Doesn't matter.
A girl needs to act pretty.
But she's still pretty. / Nice body, too.
Who's Gyeon-woo?
It's me, sir.
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
What?
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
Don't wear the same color as mine!
The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
I don't know why.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.
You don't know movies.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.
Shower?
What's sad about it?
It's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
I couldn't sleep for one week.
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Their family line is broken up now.
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
What's the matter?
/ What's wrong?
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Don't!
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?
I must be hurt still.
I think I'll never get over him.
How deep could it be?
I don't know.
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
Wow, it's deep.
I can't swim!
Yes, it's deep...
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Really?
/ I'm serious.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
Are you free?
/ Hey?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly say there is an accident of runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.
1 hours ago It's me.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Can't I join us, can I?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Now, you're dead.
Excuse me...
You've just forgotten your things.
Oh my gosh!
It's kind of you, thanks.
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Oh no.
That's all right. /All right then.
I'll help you, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. /No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Get up, bastard!
/ What the...
How're you?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
What officer?
/ Keep quiet.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Hey.
Want some of this?
/No thanks.
Try it.
It's delicious.
No. / Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Keep quiet!
/Thank you.
Thank you.
You bastard!
Do that again, and you're dead.
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
It's so delicious.
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Be good to me... and you'll always be with good luck.
If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the internet.
Go to bed now. /You too, dad.
All right, good night!
/Good night.
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Go to sleep. /Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * ¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Jump over here?
/Yeah.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
It's my birthday, not yours.
Please, let's just try.
I'll go up first and help you.
Eh?
There's a step here.
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Wait till I catch you.
Why didn't you answer?
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Yes.
Answer quietly!
/ Yes.
Is that a real gun?
Wanna see?
/ Forget it.
How are you two related?
We're just friends.
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apolize!
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Tell me the truth, idiot. / Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
While I'm in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Don't know.
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
That's why don't be foolish. /Why am I foolish?
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
I know. I know, too.
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
She'll never be the same.
You're wrong.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
I'll always think of her there.
What does 'can' mean?
It means prison.
Don't interrupt. /Sorry.
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Go!
/ Let's go together.
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
You'll come out safely.
You're leaving me alone?
There's no other way.
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
Oh, right.
Over there, there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
You're not tricking me, right?
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
I'll give you an hour!
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
Got it?
/Hurry up!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
I think you didn't.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
If not, then it's not love.
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
If you do, I'll take her.
Can I go?
/Go.
Screw it.
Shit!
Don't know.
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
What?
We're just friends?
No, I said that to save you.
Let me go, instead?
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
He wouldn't have let you go.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
What's up?
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
I like her that way. /What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
He he he
I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
It's nothing.
Looks fun, huh?
Another one?
/Why?
Don't wanna read it?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
I'll read it.
This time it's a martial arts film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo?
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
It's fun, huh?
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
If it's possible...
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Well... this is 'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...
It's going to be a hit.
Shin Cine didn't call back.
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
What's the prize?
Let's see...
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
Someone's coming.
I think this is unfair.
I'm a girl, so I'II slap the cheek.
No.
Then I'II change it, too.
But I'm a girl. /Men and women are equal.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Go easy on me, and I'II kill you.
Better slap me on the cheek.
If you don't, I'II kill you!
AII right.
You slap, and I'II use my finger.
Right, that's fair.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
It'II be the right foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Nope.
It's for me!
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
Because of you. /That's correct!
And why you were born here?
It's for me as well. /What?
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
You know the word of 'worship'?
'Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus.' huh?
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
My mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
Want a massage?
No, it's okay.
Instead, Iet's exchange shoes.
Don't wanna?
How can a guy wear heels?
It'II fit.
But, I can't...
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
I'II buy you some sneakers.
Forget it.
Then wear mine, and I'II carry yours.
You don't understand women.
Okay!
Let's exchange.
really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
I don't wear panties on exam day.
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
If you don't, I'II kill you.
Phew~ /Catch me, honey~!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
That's my house.
Wait.
I'II bring you an umbrella.
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'II just leave.
Eh?
Gee~
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Next time, don't hang out till late.
You don't understand me.
Why'd you stand him up?
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
He's dumb and has no future.
It's none of your business.
Why is he stupid?
You're stupid so you don't know.
What has gotten in to you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a Iong time.
hello?
/ Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
It's 100 days already?
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
No, I'm just kidding.
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
What's your favorite song?
That George Winston song.
PacheIbeI Canon?
Yeah, that song.
You're not gonna ask me?
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Oh my God!
A burglar!
help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
I'm cleverer than I Iook.
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I'm delivering Chinese food.
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
really?
Bring a Iot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
There's another customer.
Hey!
But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
It's a suspension!
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Let's prevent AIDS.
Taxi!
She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time,
She looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Sir?
Right.
It's a condom.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
But I haven't used it yet.
Actually, on the way here. / Forget it.
'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
'We'll satisfy all your wishes?
'
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
'Hurry and tell him.'
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Please don't worry.
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Don't see her any more.
After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We've broken up.
Now, I'm free.
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
I'm on a date with a girl.
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Same here. / Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
I'll drink coffee.
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
I heard a lot about you.
That you're a close friend.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Considering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn't get over him.
Does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him Doesn't look bad, does he?
Yes.
Hey, listen!
I'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
Man likes something more feminine.
And... don't drink a lot.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender for just once.
... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
Where's Gyeon-woo?
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
She'll beat someone.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
She'll like it a lot.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If she says she'll kill you, don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
please use the next train.
What's his name?
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
It's me, Dad.
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
What's that?
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
And two years later, let's meet here again.
We'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two, Okay?
We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Let's separate here.
Should we go together?
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
That's how we broke up.
Over time
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yu~p!
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
It's a mystery.
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
What's your secret?
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
But I couldn't come.
I guess you're a year late.
But two years didn't seem that long.
I haven't made any decision yet.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
People are dead or alive.
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
Know how long it's been?
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
I don't have to go now.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

MY SASSY GIRL
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
We promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
I'm going to wait.
Here we go.
Please don't move.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Sorry, I'm on my way.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm having my photo taken.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
He hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm a real man now.
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
Who's interrupting me?
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard. /Oh, mom...
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
I'm leaving soon.
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
It's been over a year since you saw her.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
She'll be so glad to see you.
Still there?
We don't look alike.
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Don't wear pink.
Honey!
She call him honey!
I'm not...
What are you doing!
I'm not...
You handle this!
I'm not...
Think I'm stupid?
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Why didn't you look after her?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Nothing's there when you need it.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Wow, your honey's wasted.
No, it's not my fault.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
You see, we're engaged.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
It's 40,000 won, kid.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
This phone's owner?
She's sleeping beside me.
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
No, I'm not, sir!
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please forgive me just this once.
Please forgive me.
I can't get in there...
How are you?
please, please save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please just for once!
Please...
See you!
What's your name?
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
What brought you here?
I'm innocent.
I'm telling the truth, sir!
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
No, I don't mean that!
That's exactly what you said, Motherfucker!
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
I'm home.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
Your aunt said you didn't come!
And you're telling me a lie!
What happened to your sweater?
I'm such a poor guy.
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
Since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Who's calling?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
I'll just have a Love Me.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
Well, it's...
You were drunk, so...
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
That's right.
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
That's right.
Would you believe that, too?
To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
Sorry, it's late. /Yeah...
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not.
Then are you hitting on me?
I don't wanna date you.
We're not destined for each other.
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
I think she's a heavy drinker.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
Let's go somewhere fun later.
I know what that means.
A motel?
Are you rich?
/ Of course.
How much will you give us?
We'll see, so don't worry.
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Show me your ID.
You, too.
What's with you?
Show it, now.
This sucks.
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
Don't you have a daughter?
/ I don't.
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
How dare you?
/Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
I'll show you.
Don't live like that!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What!
What is it?
/ Uh!
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
I'm sorry, but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
Then talk like friends. /Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
That's how our relationship began.
Lee Hyung-chuI.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
I'm here!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu SeoI-soo.
(In a dialect) Yes, I'm here.
Professor.
How about a break?
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's go.
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?
Let's go.
I can't.
I can't miss this class.
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
She's pretty.
Pretty?
Doesn't matter.
A girl needs to act pretty.
But she's still pretty. / Nice body, too.
Who's Gyeon-woo?
It's me, sir.
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
What?
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
Don't wear the same color as mine!
The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
I don't know why.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.
You don't know movies.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.
Shower?
What's sad about it?
It's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
I couldn't sleep for one week.
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Their family line is broken up now.
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
What's the matter?
/ What's wrong?
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Don't!
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?
I must be hurt still.
I think I'll never get over him.
How deep could it be?
I don't know.
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
Wow, it's deep.
I can't swim!
Yes, it's deep...
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Really?
/ I'm serious.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
Are you free?
/ Hey?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly say there is an accident of runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.
1 hours ago It's me.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Can't I join us, can I?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Now, you're dead.
Excuse me...
You've just forgotten your things.
Oh my gosh!
It's kind of you, thanks.
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Oh no.
That's all right. /All right then.
I'll help you, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. /No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Get up, bastard!
/ What the...
How're you?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
What officer?
/ Keep quiet.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Hey.
Want some of this?
/No thanks.
Try it.
It's delicious.
No. / Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Keep quiet!
/Thank you.
Thank you.
You bastard!
Do that again, and you're dead.
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
It's so delicious.
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Be good to me... and you'll always be with good luck.
If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the internet.
Go to bed now. /You too, dad.
All right, good night!
/Good night.
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Go to sleep. /Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * ¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Jump over here?
/Yeah.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
It's my birthday, not yours.
Please, let's just try.
I'll go up first and help you.
Eh?
There's a step here.
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Wait till I catch you.
Why didn't you answer?
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Yes.
Answer quietly!
/ Yes.
Is that a real gun?
Wanna see?
/ Forget it.
How are you two related?
We're just friends.
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apolize!
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Tell me the truth, idiot. / Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
While I'm in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Don't know.
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
That's why don't be foolish. /Why am I foolish?
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
I know. I know, too.
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
She'll never be the same.
You're wrong.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
I'll always think of her there.
What does 'can' mean?
It means prison.
Don't interrupt. /Sorry.
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Go!
/ Let's go together.
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
You'll come out safely.
You're leaving me alone?
There's no other way.
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
Oh, right.
Over there, there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
You're not tricking me, right?
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
I'll give you an hour!
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
Got it?
/Hurry up!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
I think you didn't.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
If not, then it's not love.
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
If you do, I'll take her.
Can I go?
/Go.
Screw it.
Shit!
Don't know.
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
What?
We're just friends?
No, I said that to save you.
Let me go, instead?
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
He wouldn't have let you go.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
What's up?
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
I like her that way. /What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
He he he
I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
It's nothing.
Looks fun, huh?
Another one?
/Why?
Don't wanna read it?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
I'll read it.
This time it's a martial arts film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo?
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
It's fun, huh?
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
If it's possible...
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Well... this is 'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...
It's going to be a hit.
Shin Cine didn't call back.
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
What's the prize?
Let's see...
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
Someone's coming.
I think this is unfair.
I'm a girl, so I'II slap the cheek.
No.
Then I'II change it, too.
But I'm a girl. /Men and women are equal.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Go easy on me, and I'II kill you.
Better slap me on the cheek.
If you don't, I'II kill you!
AII right.
You slap, and I'II use my finger.
Right, that's fair.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
It'II be the right foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Nope.
It's for me!
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
Because of you. /That's correct!
And why you were born here?
It's for me as well. /What?
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
You know the word of 'worship'?
'Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus.' huh?
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
My mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
Want a massage?
No, it's okay.
Instead, Iet's exchange shoes.
Don't wanna?
How can a guy wear heels?
It'II fit.
But, I can't...
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
I'II buy you some sneakers.
Forget it.
Then wear mine, and I'II carry yours.
You don't understand women.
Okay!
Let's exchange.
really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
I don't wear panties on exam day.
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
If you don't, I'II kill you.
Phew~ /Catch me, honey~!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
That's my house.
Wait.
I'II bring you an umbrella.
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'II just leave.
Eh?
Gee~
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Next time, don't hang out till late.
You don't understand me.
Why'd you stand him up?
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
He's dumb and has no future.
It's none of your business.
Why is he stupid?
You're stupid so you don't know.
What has gotten in to you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a Iong time.
hello?
/ Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
It's 100 days already?
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
No, I'm just kidding.
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
What's your favorite song?
That George Winston song.
PacheIbeI Canon?
Yeah, that song.
You're not gonna ask me?
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Oh my God!
A burglar!
help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
I'm cleverer than I Iook.
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I'm delivering Chinese food.
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
really?
Bring a Iot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
There's another customer.
Hey!
But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
It's a suspension!
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Let's prevent AIDS.
Taxi!
She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time,
She looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Sir?
Right.
It's a condom.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
But I haven't used it yet.
Actually, on the way here. / Forget it.
'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
'We'll satisfy all your wishes?
'
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
'Hurry and tell him.'
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Please don't worry.
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Don't see her any more.
After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We've broken up.
Now, I'm free.
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
I'm on a date with a girl.
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Same here. / Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
I'll drink coffee.
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
I heard a lot about you.
That you're a close friend.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Considering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn't get over him.
Does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him Doesn't look bad, does he?
Yes.
Hey, listen!
I'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
Man likes something more feminine.
And... don't drink a lot.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender for just once.
... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
Where's Gyeon-woo?
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
She'll beat someone.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
She'll like it a lot.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If she says she'll kill you, don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
please use the next train.
What's his name?
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
It's me, Dad.
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
What's that?
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
And two years later, let's meet here again.
We'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two, Okay?
We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Let's separate here.
Should we go together?
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
That's how we broke up.
Over time
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yu~p!
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
It's a mystery.
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
What's your secret?
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
But I couldn't come.
I guess you're a year late.
But two years didn't seem that long.
I haven't made any decision yet.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
People are dead or alive.
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
(Time machine flying away...)
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
Know how long it's been?
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
I don't have to go now.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met an old man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First half
Friend 1 :
He hasn't changed at all.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm a real man now.
Friend 2:
Hey, asshole.
Friend 1 :
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
Gyeon-woo:
You irritate me!
Gyeon-woo:
Give me a break, asshole.
Gyeon-woo:
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Friend 1 :
Who are you kidding?
Friend 2:
hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
(cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:(In anger) Who's interrupting me?
Gyeon-woo:
hello?
Who is this?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Your mother, you bastard.
/Gyeon-woo:
Oh, mom...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:

Gyeon-woo:
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Friends:

Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Make sure you pay a visit.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
It's been over a year since you saw her.
Gyeon-woo:
That long?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She says you resemble him.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'II be so glad to see you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
still there?
Gyeon-woo:
We don't look alike.
Gyeon-woo:
plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Gyeon-woo:
uncle does, too.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'II introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
Gyeon-woo:
I know the type she likes.
Gyeon-woo:
tell her no thanks.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day... (Train arriving)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
girl:
Hey, get up!
girl:
Offer your seat to the elder!
Man:
Ugh!
girl:
Go!
girl:
Hey.
girl:
Don't wear pink.
(girl feeling like vomiting)
(She swallows at a gulp)
(Gyeon-woo's disgusted at the sight)
(She throws up)
(people around them in commotion)
girl:
Honey!
people:
She calls him honey!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
old man:
What are you doing!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
old man:
You handle this!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
old man:
Think I'm stupid?
old man:
Come here!
old man:
Are you laughing?
old man:
Why didn't you look after her?
old man:
Hurry and do something!
old man:(In a rage) What are you doing?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
old man:
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Nothing's there when you need it.
Gyeon-woo:
Where did all those motels go?
Gyeon-woo:
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Gyeon-woo:
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Innkeeper:(sarcastically) Wow, your honey wasted.
Gyeon-woo:
No, it's not my fault.
Innkeeper:
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Gyeon-woo:
You see, we're engaged.
Innkeeper:
Western or Korean style?
Gyeon-woo:
Give me any room.
Innkeeper:
Room 405.
Gyeon-woo:
None on the first floor?
Innkeeper:
Fourth floor!
(Knock on the door)
Innkeeper:
You forgot to check in.
Innkeeper:
It's 40,000 won, kid.
Gyeon-woo:

Innkeeper:

Innkeeper:

Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What happened to your sweater?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I'm such a poor guy.
AII this cause of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
Gyeon-woo:(Running away) You asked if I went to Bupyung!
Gyeon-woo:
I did, but not to see auntie!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from me,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'II get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Up four points in three years.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
call this a report card?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from your mom,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'II get good grades if you study harder.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'II never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.

Gyeon-woo:

(cell phone hangs up)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) How could she do this?

Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk, so...
girl:
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
Gyeon-woo:
I saved you from the train.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
girl:
So I called you honey?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
girl:
I kind of remember that.
girl:
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat,
girl:and the police came?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
girl:
would you believe that, too?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
girl:
So I did that, right?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, you did.
Waitress:(Serving coffee) Sorry, it's late.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah...
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
Gyeon-woo:
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
girl:
Are you mocking me?
Gyeon-woo:(Embarrassed) No, I'm not.
girl:
Then are you hitting on me?
girl:(directly) I don't wanna date you.
girl:
We're not destined for each other.
girl:
Throw the trash away.
Gyeon-woo:(feeling absurd) Damn it.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I think she's a heavy drinker.
girl:
You order.
Gyeon-woo:
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
girl:(Throwing a menu card) Eat GoIbangee.
Gyeon-woo:(GrumbIing) Then you should order.

Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Man 2:
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
girl:
Don't you have a daughter?
/Man 2:
I don't.
Bear me one.
girl:
Who the hell do you think you are?
Man 2:
How dare you?
/girl:
Come on, Iet's fight!

Man 1 :
Catch the girls.
Gyeon-woo:(Pouring soju) Have a drink and calm down.
girl:(Keeping drinking) Shit!
girl:
Ah~!
girl:(Sobbing out) Huk~!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I Iook at her.
girl:
Did you blow your nose on this?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
girl:(girl starting to cry) Huk~ huk~ huk~~~!
Gyeon-woo:
please stop crying.

/Gyeon-woo:
Uh!

Gyeon-woo:(Gyeon-woo feeling sick at the girl) Ack!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
while watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
girl:
Give me some water.
girl:(Getting up) Hey.
girl:
Why am I here?
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry,
Gyeon-woo:but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
Gyeon-woo:

So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Gyeon-woo:
Nothing.

Gyeon-woo:(Screaming) No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
girl:
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
Gyeon-woo:
I will.

How could you throw the butt here?

Man on the street:

It's an action movie.
Gyeon-woo:

The ending sucks.

Gotta change it.
Gyeon-woo:
How?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Their family line is broken up now.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
This was her last request.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:(Surprised) What?
Gyeon-woo's Father:

Taxi driver:

girl:and you'II always be with good luck.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hands.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick.
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
(The sound of fulling cloth)
Gyeon-woo's Father:
You studying now?
Gyeon-woo:

Got it?
Gyeon-woo:

Gyeon-woo:(Sigh) Phew~~
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'II be alone with her in the park.
It'II be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'II be thrilled.
(Laughing)
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
girl:
Jump over here?
/Gyeon-woo:

We have to.
Gyeon-woo:
I always wanted to come here at night.

It's my birthday, not yours.
Gyeon-woo:

There's a step here.
Gyeon-woo:
Take my hand.
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, shit!
(TumbIing down)

Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
girl:
Wait till I catch you.
girl:
Why didn't you answer?
girl:
Wanna die?
Deserter:
Come with me!
(The sound of car passing by)
Deserter:
Hurry and get in.
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
Deserter:
Shut up!
Deserter:
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Deserter:
If you're loud, I'II kill you.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) Yes.
Deserter:

/Gyeon-woo:(quietly) Yes.
(Gyeon-woo startled at her)
girl:
Is that a real gun?
Deserter:

Deserter:
How are you two related?
Gyeon-woo:
We're just friends.
Deserter:

You mean she could be my pussy?
girl:

I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apologize!
Deserter:

I'm sorry.
Deserter:
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Deserter:
Why are you here?
Gyeon-woo:(Stammering) We just wanted to come here at night.
Deserter:

/Gyeon-woo:
Nothing special.
Deserter:
bullshit.
Deserter:
What makes you trust a guy like him?
girl:
I trusted myself.
Deserter:(Sigh) I had a girlfriend, too.
Deserter:
She visited me every week for one year.
Deserter:
I was so happy.
Deserter:
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
Deserter:
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Deserter:(Sobbing) Damn it.
Deserter:
while I'm in the service, even my dog...
Deserter:ran away with some mutt, too.
Deserter:
My Yorkshire Terrier.
Bitch.
Deserter:
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
Deserter:
I have the worst luck in this world.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Deserter:
Know what special day is it today?
Deserter:
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
(A deserter screaming)
(As if feeling sick) Uuuuuuuhhh~ ack!
girl:
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Gyeon-woo:
Don't know.
girl:
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
girl:
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Deserter:
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Deserter:
Stop joking around.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Damn it!
Deserter:
Even you bastards ignore me.
girl:
That's why don't be foolish.
/Deserter:
Why am I foolish?
girl:
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
Deserter:
I know.
I know, too.
Deserter:
But if I die, she'II be heartbroken.
Deserter:
She'II never be the same.
girl:
You're wrong.
girl:
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
Deserter:
You went through something like this?
girl:
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Deserter:
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'II go to the can.
Deserter:
I'II always think of her there.
girl:
What does 'can' mean?
Gyeon-woo:
It means prison.
Deserter:
Don't interrupt.
/Gyeon-woo:
Sorry.
girl:
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, sir.
Gyeon-woo:
How about letting her go?
Deserter:
If I say no?
Gyeon-woo:
Then...
Gyeon-woo:...
let me go, instead.
Deserter:
Come to think of it,
Deserter:your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
Deserter:
You act like him, too.
Deserter:
You can go.
Deserter:
And you...
Deserter:
We die together.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:
Pardon?
Deserter:
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Deserter:
Go!
/girl:
Let's go together.
girl:
AII three of us.
Deserter:

girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
girl:
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
girl:
You'II come out safely.
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) You're leaving me alone?
girl:
There's no other way.
Deserter:
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
(The sound of radio signal)
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
Gyeon-woo:
Over there,
Gyeon-woo:there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Gyeon-woo:
Nobody knows about it.
Gyeon-woo:
I used to work here.
Deserter:
really?
Deserter:
You're not tricking me, right?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Deserter:

Gyeon-woo:
See?
I told you so.
(The radio signal)
soldier 1 :

(The radio signal still going on)
girl:
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
girl:
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
girl:
Did you really love her?
girl:
Ask yourself.
girl:
I think you didn't.
girl:
If you really love her,
girl:you should let her go.
girl:
If not, then it's not love.
girl:
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
girl:
Stop this,
girl:and go back to base as a real man.
girl:
A person like you should learn more about love.
girl:(Crying) If we want to Iearn,
girl:then we should keep living.
Deserter:(Crying) Damn it.
Deserter:
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Deserter:

Deserter:
If you do, I'II take her.
Gyeon-woo:
Can I go?
/Deserter:

(Fireworking) Pop!
Pop!
Deserter:
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
Deserter:
I'II live on until I learn what love is.
girl:
What?
We're just friends?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I said that to save you.
girl:
Let me go, instead?
girl:
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
He wouldn't have let you go.
girl:
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
girl:
Have a nice life alone.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second half
Waiter:
I remember.
Waiter:
She always came with him until last year.
Waiter:
Was it last spring or autumn?
Waiter:
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
Waiter:
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
girl:
What's up?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, hi.
girl:
You're early.
Gyeon-woo:
I was in the neighborhood.
girl:
Miss me?
Gyeon-woo:
Of course!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She always tried hard to look cheerful.
Gyeon-woo:
I Iike her that way.
/Waiter:

Gyeon-woo:
Coke, please.
girl:
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
girl:
Two coffees, please.
(Gyeon-woo grinning) He he he~
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
girl:
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
It's nothing.
girl:
Looks fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Another one?
/girl:
Why?
Don't wanna read it?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She may get disappointed,
Gyeon-woo:but I should be honest for her sake.
Gyeon-woo:
Looks fun.
I'II read it.
(girl laughing brightly) Ha ha ha~
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) This time it's a martial art film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
(people around a montage in commotion)
Man 1 :
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Man 2:
Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo:
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
(CunningIy laugh) He he he~
(Gyeon-woo screaming and running for her) Yaaaah~
(girl drawing a sword) Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
girl:
It's fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Why is the heroine always from the future?
girl:
Science is advanced then,
girl:so they invent a time machine.
girl:
And people go to the past to travel.
girl:
people from the future could be here now.
girl:
I think UFOs are time machines.
girl:
Someday, I'II meet someone from the future.
girl:
I have to.
Gyeon-woo:
If you do, ask him to take you.
girl:
What?
Gyeon-woo:
If it's possible...
girl:
Give this to Shin Cine.

girl:
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Gyeon-woo:

(Man feeling like vomiting) Uuuuuuuugh~
(Man throwing up) Uuuh~ Aaaack~!
Gyeon-woo:
It's going to be a hit.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Shin Cine didn't call back.
girl:
Hey!
girl:
Hey, kid.
girl:
Is the subway your sketch book?
girl:
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
Woman:
My lipstick!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
girl:
Left foot over the line, I win.
girl:
With the right foot, you win.
Gyeon-woo:
What's the prize?
girl:
Let's see...
Gyeon-woo:

Gyeon-woo:
No.
Then I'II change it, too.
girl:
But I'm a girl.
/Gyeon-woo:
Men and women are equal.
girl:
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.

Gyeon-woo:
You slap, and I'II use my finger.

girl's Father:
Next time, don't hang out till late.
girl's Mom:
You don't understand me.
girl's Mom:
Why'd you stand him up?
girl's Mom:
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
girl's Mom:
And what happened to your heels?
girl's Mom:
What's wrong with you?
girl's Mom:
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
girl's Mom:
He's dumb and has no future.
girl:
It's none of your business.
girl:
Why is he stupid?
girl:
You're stupid so you don't know.
girl's Mom:
What has gotten in to you?
girl:
Let me live my own life!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a Iong time.
(cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:
hello?
/girl:
Gyeon-woo, it's me.
girl:
Long time no see.
Gyeon-woo:
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
girl:
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
Gyeon-woo:
It's 100 days already?
girl:
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
Gyeon-woo:
When a sexy woman is naked.
girl:
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm just kidding.
Gyeon-woo:
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
girl:
What's your favorite song?
Gyeon-woo:
That George Winston song.
(Gyeon-woo humming) Ta Ia Ia Ia Ia Ia~ Ta Ia~~~
girl:
PacheIbeI's 'Canon'?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, that song.
girl:
You're not gonna ask me?
Gyeon-woo:
When is the guy the prettiest?
girl:
Just give me a rose.
girl:
still have your high school uniform?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Why?
girl:
Bring it on our 100th day,
girl:and give me a rose during my class.
girl:
Do it yourself, okay?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
(Students shouting to be quiet)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Oh my God!
A burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
help, a burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
And you...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm cleverer than I Iook.
Gyeon-woo:
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Guard:
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm delivering Chinese food.
Guard:
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Gyeon-woo:
really?
Guard:
Bring a Iot of radish?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, I forgot something!
Guard:
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
Gyeon-woo:
There's another customer.
Guard:
Hey!
(classroom in commotion...) (becoming as silent as death...)
(Again in commotion)
(PacheIbeI's 'Canon' begins to be played)
(Students clapping and shouting)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
girl:
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gyeon-woo:
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Gyeon-woo:
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
Gyeon-woo:
feeling so good!
girl:
Have a smoke, too!
Gyeon-woo:
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gyeon-woo:
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
Gyeon-woo:
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
Gyeon-woo:
It's a suspension!
girl:
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
girl:
Go ahead and smoke!
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
Gyeon-woo:
You go to very good school!
girl:
Not to worry.
Gyeon-woo:
This clothes is so tight!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Condom man:
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Condom man:
Let's prevent AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
Taxi!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I Iooked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
girl's Father:
Here.
girl's Father:
Have any plans after graduation?
Gyeon-woo:
actually, I've never thought about it yet.
girl's Father:
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Gyeon-woo:
Sir?
Right.
(girl's Mom mumbling without sound) 'It's a condom.'
girl's Father:
What is this for?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
I Iearned that it prevents AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
But I haven't used it yet.
Gyeon-woo:
actually, on the way here.
/girl's Father:
Forget it.
girl's Father:'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
girl's Father:'We'II satisfy all your wishes?
'
Gyeon-woo:
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
girl's Mom:(Without sound) 'Hurry and tell him.'
girl's Father:
How do feel about our daughter?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Gyeon-woo:
please don't worry.
Gyeon-woo:
If we get closer, I'II let you know, sir.
girl's Father:
Don't see her any more.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We're broken up.
Now, I'm free.
(cellular phone ringing)
girl:
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'cIock.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
girl:
What?
I have a blind date today.
girl:
Come in 45 minutes.
Gyeon-woo:
I have a blind date, too.
(Gyeon-woo surprised)
(cellular phone ringing)
girl:
Are you on your way?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm on a date with a girl.
girl:
Hurry up.
Woman:
I have to go to the bathroom.
Gyeon-woo:'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Gyeon-woo:(In amazement) Eh?
(Gyeon-woo sobbing as he feels mistreated)
Gyeon-woo:
Nice to meet you.
Seok-won:
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Gyeon-woo:
Same here.
/Seok-won:
Have a seat.
girl:
Were you really with a girl?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I was with a guy.
Waiter:
Can I take your order?
Gyeon-woo:
Coffee, please.
girl:
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo:
I'II drink coffee.
Seok-won:
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
Seok-won:
I heard a Iot about you.
That you're close friend.
Gyeon-woo:
Friend...
girl:
I need to go to the bathroom.
girl:
How is he?
Gyeon-woo:
No idea...
but he looks nice.
Gyeon-woo:
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
girl:
How do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
When you see a new man...
Gyeon-woo:forget about the past, all right?
girl:
How the hell do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
Gyeon-woo:
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Gyeon-woo:
Considering your temper...
and you...
Gyeon-woo:used to tell that you couldn't get over him.
Gyeon-woo:
Does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world?
girl:
That man is the one my mom introduced me to meet.
girl:
She kept pushing me to meet him...
girl:
Doesn't look bad guy, does he?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, listen!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm totally OK, but you should be obedient to man.
Gyeon-woo:
Man likes something more feminine.
Gyeon-woo:
And... don't drink a Iot.
Gyeon-woo:
Some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated.
Gyeon-woo:
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys
Gyeon-woo:try to surrender for just once.
Gyeon-woo:... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
girl:
Where's Gyeon-woo?
Seok-won:
He left already.
Seok-won:
He told me ten rules to follow.
Seok-won:
I have a good memory.
I'II recite them.
Seok-won:
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Gyeon-woo:
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
Gyeon-woo:
She'II beat someone.
Gyeon-woo:
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
Gyeon-woo:
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
Gyeon-woo:
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
Gyeon-woo:
On your 100th day together,
Gyeon-woo:give her a rose during her class.
Gyeon-woo:
She'II like it a Iot.
Gyeon-woo:
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Gyeon-woo:
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
Gyeon-woo:
If she says she'II kill you,
Gyeon-woo:don't take it lightly.
You'II feel better.
Gyeon-woo:
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Gyeon-woo:
finally, she likes to write.
Gyeon-woo:
Encourage her.
(girl breathing hard)
(Station attendant) Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to here...
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Station attendant:
Step backward on the yellow line...
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:... after passenger's getting off, take in order...
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:...please use the next train.
Station attendant:
What's his name?
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'II do it myself.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I Iooked all over for you.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
girl:
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
girl:
Who told you to hug me?
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
girl:
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
(DoorbeII ringing)
girl's Father:
Who is it?
girl:
It's me, Dad.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
(Bird twittering around)
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
girl:
See that mountain top?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
girl:
could someone hear me from there?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
girl:
Then go over there.
I'II shout here.
girl:
If you hear, answer me.
Gyeon-woo:
You want me to go over there?
girl:
Yeah.
girl:
Gyeon-woo?
girl:
Can you hear me?
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
girl:
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
(Crying)
girl:
Did you bring your letter?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
What's that?
girl:
A time capsule.
girl:
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
girl:
And two years later, Iet's meet here again.
girl:
We'II read the letters that day,
girl:and maybe we can find an answer then.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
girl:
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'II be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
girl:
Let's separate here.
Gyeon-woo:
should we go together?
girl:
No, I'II take the next train.
I think that's better.
Gyeon-woo:
See you two years later!
girl:
Okay, in two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Bye!
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) That's how we broke up.
Overtime
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'II show her a different myself.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
(gulp... gulp...) (Shouting) Yu~p!
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy girl'.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
(Gyeon-woo crying out in surprise) Wow!
Gyeon-woo:
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo:
It's a mystery.
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I Ioved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
while I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) After that day, I went often to this place.
girl:
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
girl:
Why are you staring at me, sir?
old man:
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
girl:
Do you come here often?
old man:
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
girl:
I have a secret here, too.
old man:
really?
girl:
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
girl:
What's your secret?
old man:
So what happened?
girl:
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
girl:
But I couldn't come.
old man:
I guess you're a year late.
girl:
But two years didn't seem that long.
girl:
I haven't made any decision yet.
girl:
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
old man:
Like what?
girl:
If we were destined to meet,
girl:
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
old man:
Know what fate is?
old man:
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
old man:
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
old man:
I said this tree had a secret, right?
girl:
Yes.
old man:
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
girl:
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
old man:
people are dead or alive.
old man:
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
old man:
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
old man:
It was split into two.
old man:
But this young man felt sorry for it.
old man:
During this spring,
old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
old man:
When he planted the tree,
old man:he asked me if it look the same.
old man:
He said that someone would be sad if it died,
old man:so no one should know.
girl:
Gyeon-woo...
(Recorded mechanical voice) You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
girl:
Hi.
Woman:
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
girl:
You still look young.
How have you been?
Woman:
You were in england?
girl:
Yes.
For one and a half years.
girl:
So I can forget him.
Woman:
I see.
feel better?
girl:
Yes.
A Iot better.
Woman:
Is it true now?
Woman:
My son might be sad.
girl:
He won't.
He'II like it this way.
Woman:
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Gyeon-woo:
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
Auntie:
You naughty boy.
Auntie:
Know how long it's been?
Auntie:
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
Auntie:
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
Auntie:
When you had a hard time,
Auntie:
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,
Auntie:but he kept getting out of it.
Auntie:
Heard you came to Bupyung often,
Auntie:but you never visited me?
Auntie:
Go out with him.
Auntie:
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Auntie:
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to england, right?
Auntie:
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
Gyeon-woo:
I don't have to go now.
Auntie:
Why?
You two know each other?
girl:
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
girl:
From your future.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.
Patient has Pneumothorax but is trapped under the panel
There are no doctors we can't perform aspiration
Send the emergency unit here now
Help me!
I can't perform aspiration, doctor!
BP 170/100, pulse 100, SAO270
Help!
I'll lose my license
I... won't make it
I'm sorry
Stay where you are!
You may lose your job, but remember you saved someone's life
Breathing is steady, BP 170/80 pulse 80, SAO295
No hospital is like that!
Ridiculous!
Dr. Wong!
Thanks!
This place requires forms for everything
You're lucky to have Dr. Wong supervising you!
He's a good teacher
This is for first visit, this is for blood test and this is for X-ray
These two are the most important
Claim forms for meal and transportation
The hospital has a liability system so write intelligibly then no one can sue you for malpractice
What?
I...
Ho Kau Kei
Yes, you're at the Ho Kau Kei Hospital
What happened to him?
Got hit by lightning
What would you do, Dr. Ho?
Take his blood pressure and SAO2
Check his optic nerve for any damage
Check for facial palsy
Most likely he won't make it
If he died in the A E, there is report to write and maybe a law suit to settle
We should send him away
You know where to?
Surgery!
Dr. Ma is on duty there
He's too busy watching horse races to treat anyone
Orthopedics' Dr. Yau I can't get along so he's out
The only one left is the old maid at General Medicine
I heard she's in love, been in good mood lately
She'll take the patient
Take him away!
Got hit by lightning at this age must've done some bad things
I've done good deeds!
I know you're a scum
No internal injury, Surgery!
This is what a lightning victim look like
God will punish you for doing bad things
I've done good deeds!
Stop explaining yourself!
Forget it!
Take him to Orthopedics
Why is he here if his bones are fine?
Surgery!
He was just there
Then General Medicine
He was there too
Take him back to the A E
Aren't you ashamed of shoving an old man to different departments?
How about that hemorrhoids patient
You sent here last time?
Your department has openings you should treat everyone!
Orthopedics is not A E's dumpster
You can't just send people up
My diagnosis comes from careful thinking and examination
I know what I'm doing
He has no fractures, not even a spondylitis
How about his bone density level?
Why don't you say a fish bone got stuck in his throat?
Time to leave!
Left-over from the last shift push him aside
He looks familiar
Every dying old man looks just like this
Send him up
You're in the way, old fart!
Move!
It stinks!
He's burnt
Old man, elevator maintenance, take a breather
I only did good deeds, nothing bad
It's okay, being struck by lightning is a natural phenomenon
When the atmosphere acquires sufficient electricity
A discharge of electricity will strike an object on the ground
Those people have no sense
You're a good man
Sorry, I'm just a new doctor
This is all I can do
Next time I'll give you a room
Brown-nosers!
This is the reality:
You kiss ass to those about you
How many doctors are actually impartial and committed?
Let's eat!
Don't let go of your hands!
Go on hitting me if you like, Sir Ho
I can take it
Don't like your food?
Order something else!
It's your treat anyway
When did he last eat?
Call for help!
AMI!
Doesn't look like chest pain, could be asthma!
It's pouring outside!
His face is turning red, he's choking
He smells!
I can't get any closer
I've never smelled anything this bad
Well done!
I feel itchy just by the brief contact
Observe carefully, girl.
This is an example of medical ethics!
It's like a miracle!
What a pity!
He'll probably make it!
She's too busy for dinner
We'll have it wrapped to go
The food's cold, I'll get her another order
She barely touched her steak
Maybe she'll like pork chop!
I'll get her hot coffee
With little sugar
Are you okay, mister?
You all right?
He was choking.
Had no pulse and heart beat
I performed CPR.
There's pulse now but very weak
So he's fine!
We won't take him then
I just had the car cleaned!
Let me...
Get in
Al, don't take him to Ho Kau Kei!
You did good, I'm very pleased
I'm not, you're not fit to be a doctor
8 years ago, I came to the hospital for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, nice body too
If the scar doesn't allow her to wear bikinis ruins her chance to marry a good family her life will be meaningless!
She's 1, 5 ft. 1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes up 1/3 of the human body
If we cut 1 inch lower, her pants will hide the scar
But this raises the operation's difficulty
Difficulty is not an issue
The patient's future is what counts
It's not easy to be a doctor!
It's not easy to be a doctor
I became a doctor because of what you said
But look at you now, look at your hair!
It's all greasy, what a mess!
And now you drive a Volvo, afraid you may die?
I really miss you driving your GTR and your spiky hair-do
He's fired up!
That gets him going!
Sir Ho, someone attacked you?
Who did?
I started the fight
Those morons don't know better
The 7F Management should go to hell!
They only wanted my money, not my suggestions
So I attacked them with Shaolin Kung-Fu!
They still tried to fight back
I knocked them down with the Shadow Kick
I beat them under the ground
I dare them to talk back at me
What are you doing?
Plugging your tubes back
Kid, don't move around when I'm talking to you
I want to reform the hospital but there's no one to trust
I believe in you.
You're the answer!
I can't, I'm new here
I'm ninety-something and you won't help me where's your compassion?
I'd love to help but I can't change the system myself
Okay, who do you have in mind?
Say it, I'll write it down
Nothing at this moment
Say it
Where are you going?
I think I've got the answer!
Who is it?
Who made this mess?
Accident at a construction site
Fracture in the left thigh, multiple lacerations
Conscious Index 10, BP 10/50
Pulse 110 1, 2, 3
Cross match, CBP, ECG, SAO2
Everything ready
Forceps!
Hypodermoclysis, units of unmatched blood
Blood plasma full rate, check for any internal bleeding
I need a hand!
A shot of ampoules, Defibrillator!
200!
Clear!
I had it, it was all right
Did you watch TV last night?
The show was so lame!
Give me a coffee
Any sugar?
A little
Listen to the radio now
It's hard to be a good doctor in this hospital!
Forceps!
I need a hand!
It's alcohol!
200!
Clear!
Should we go find him?
Rescue Center
Rectification
Emergency Check-up
Supersonic Welding
Give me a 23
Brake fluid 200cc, engine oil liters
Battery water 0cc accumulator plate 10cc
Clear!
Start the engine!
Joe!
How is it coming?
I welded back the chassis
How many more years can the car go?
The parts I repaired should give you another 10 years
Thank you!
We'll go in and take a look
Joe!
It's different this time
Think about it, we've got Sir Ho
I won't go back
Don't be so cold, help me out here!
Prepare the Rescue Center
Just this once!
Hurry!
Leave
If this is the way you are, I'll stay here until you say yes!
Fine, see how long you'll last
Don't leave me here
Damage all over.
Rocker arm is wasted so is the ball bearing the suspension
Get me a screw, and remove the connecting rod
It hurts
Your determination can't last 3 minutes
We've been friends for so long, let it go
I really made up my mind, trust me!
You never follow through with anything in your life
We gave our resignation when the hospital demanded reform
But you handed in a Christmas card!
Stay there!
8 years ago, I came to the hospital for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, good body
If the scar doesn't allow her to wear bikinis and ruins her chance to marry a good family
Her life will be meaningless1
She's 1, 5ft, 1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes of 1/3 of the human body
If we cut one inch lower, her pants can hide the scar
But the operation will be more difficult!
Difficulty is not the issue
What matters is the patient's future!
Remember, it's not easy to be a doctor!
It's not easy to be a doctor
I became a doctor because of what you said
That's not what you told me
A good doctor like you repairing cars?
You have to fix my car it belongs to my boss
I like saving cars more than saving lives
What happened?
You may fool others, but you can't fool yourself
This place looks just like an A E
So where is your heart at?
Air compression 0%, get me a pump and a drill
You will come back!
You have to help me out
You said last time I was the reason you became a doctor
Yeah
Back there you said it was because of Joe
Yeah
So who really inspired you?
It's not important who inspired me
What matters is who I will marry
What are you talking about?
Don't laugh at what I'm about to say
I can't promise how I will react
That time when I underwent the operation
I had a crush on you guys and wanted to marry you
But I can't be married to two guys at once
So I decided to marry whoever that said It's not easy to be a doctor
Don't laugh, I'm serious!
But I was drugged at the time, feeling unconscious couldn't figure out who said the words
Good, everyone's here
I hope you can tell me what you think
Say something!
You first, Benz
You know the answer already
Are you for it, Mitsubishi?
The girl made some good points
She's hot!
When she pulled down her panty
Don't go!
Don't be like that!
Stop crying!
You can't just go and leave us here
You're crazy!
Irresponsible!
Calm down!
Golf, we can't be selfish
This is a garage after all
Joe has been a doctor all his life!
Go back, Joe
Thanks
Thanks
Someone attacked you again?
Who did?
No good!
I started the fight!
The management bastards on the 7th floor said I can't hire people, won't let me sign you
So I attacked them using the Mantis Stance
Signit!
I fought very hard to get this
Kid, you're sitting on my tube
I'm ninety-something and you won't help me?
Where's your compassion?
Won't be easy to change things
There's Andy, Leon and the gang
Plus the Management Rats are spying on us
What?
Those Rats again?
I'll talk care of them!
Okay, but you have to promise me don't die on us before we succeed
Sure!
Signit!
After being struck by lightning last month at the Peak
Philanthropist Sir Ho was found at the same place this morning
He was burnt and his condition was critical
Police believes that Sir Ho returned to the Peak for Kung-fu training
When lightning hit him again
This is worse than last time!
Sir Ho
Poor old man got stuck by lightning twice
He probably won't wake up again
Maybe we should
No!
This is Sir Ho's last wish
We have to fulfill it for him!
How?
We can't win the fight without his support
Sir Ho is ninety-something and you won't help him?
Where's your compassion?
Sir Ho manages to stay alive
He kept his promise, and so should we!
Thwart their plan
They're really sneaky!
His face is pale, must be anemic
I heard they haven't left the room for years
What a pity, working in dark could result in amblyopia
Sorry, sorry!
Besides triage if the A E can help any patient, we'll do it ourselves
Every shift is 8 hours, you can't be late
Good morning!
What are we discussing now?
Being on-time!
Really?
No unexcused absence
We have to go now, bye!
Bye!
Have a good time
You have one hour to eat
No food is allowed while you're on duty
Delivery!
I ordered it!
Over here please!
I'm starving
No phone calls during operation
Hello?
I'm busy now listening to nonsense
I'll call you from the OR later
Meeting adjourned
Hold there!
You are new here, so listen carefully:
Use the first urinal to finish business, not the other ones
Cleaning all of them is too much work, trying to kill me?
You clean up your own spots!
Meeting adjourned!
You call this a hospital?
Doctors don't save lives
Cleaning ladies don't clean
That's not all
Maintenance guys don't maintain appliances
Yeah!
Pharmacists don't fill prescriptions filing assistants don't file papers
That's not the worse!
Canteen serves cold coffee soda machine dispenses warm drinks
We'll do it ourselves!
Does it work?
The stock you
Recommended lost all values
Don't worry, the owner is my friend
He said to hold on to them
How is it, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything we can
Don't cry
We'll try again, let's go!
Take it away!
It can't be done
How can you revive the dead?
I just unplugged the instruments
No breathing, no heartbeat
I'll do it
By the order of the Highest Management 3 doctors can't work on one patient at once
This is against cost effectiveness
Be aware...
Be aware
Terrible, more ribs are cracked
He should let the guy rest in peace
Yeah ...but an important reminder:
According to the Service Agreement 300!
Every patient gets 5 minutes of resuscitation procedure
You've exceeded the time hundreds of patients will be affected
This is a BBQ.
I can smell the char
The mortician will have a hard time touching up the body
One unit of Type O negative is $200
One injection is $1000
Every pack of cotton balls is $30
More cotton
He really won't give up until the corpse is destroyed
He should at least show respect for the family
In order to balance the earnings and expenses we'll either fire medical staff or reduce medical supplies
Over-budget, overtime, over-budget, overtime
We've got pulse!
Put him on Dopamine
Loser!
Bastard!
Doctor, it's okay
Are you done?
Hurry up!
We've got patients waiting!
How's my son, doctor?
He's got heartbeat we're taking him to the OR
I love you!
I saved you because it's what I do it doesn't mean I love you
Why not?
I don't like beggars
A rival!
What?
Did Yan say who she's going to marry?
What are you talking about?
She made a vow, if you said it she'll marry you if I said it she'll marry me
She'll marry me if I said it, and will marry you if you said it
No!
She'll marry you if I said it, and marry me if you said it
She'll marry you if I said it, and marry me if you said it
You have it all wrong.
Like I said
She'll marry whoever said it
That's right
Said what?
It's not easy to be a doctor
You remember who said it?
Either you or I
Good memory
Of course
What are you doing?
Every doctor has a kind heart it's the system that corrupted them
I'll remind them who they really are!
How?
Setting an example by doing everything
Will that include many meaningless chores?
The more meaningless the better!
Go for it...
Go for it
The manual
Not in Chinese?
Go for it...
Go for it
Go for it...
Go for it
3 hours left until the next shift, let's get some rest
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Time to work!
As usual, there's no one here
I have to go to the bathroom
You're always like this
Haven't eaten yet?
You think we can change them?
Someone plans to jump off of the building!
How can this happen?
See?
They responded!
I love you!
I found a job, I'm no longer a beggar
I don't date part-time construction worker
It's a full-time job!
I don't like someone uneducated
Buddy, don't jump!
Wait!
What are you doing?
My car!
Life comes first!
Let me move my car first!
Don't jump!
Don't make me hit you, kid!
Let me move my car first!
I've nothing to do with this!
What's wrong with you?
You hit my car!
Calm down
Don't come closer!
Tell me your problem
Too late!
I came here for Appendectomy, but had my sperm duct removed
Then a bad blood transfusion destroyed my liver
During liver transplant bad oxygen destroyed my lung years later and my duodenum is still not removed instead my body is all messed up
My boss fired me, my wife left me
My existence is meaningless!
My death will bring attention to this hospital's negligence
No, nobody will care
Look, they're busy getting their cars out of the way
Give us a little time
We are trying to make changes
This place will turn into a caring and responsible hospital
Really?
Caring?
Pay up!
You can't check-out without paying
I'm about to jump!
That's the same as checking-out, pay up
I have no money
Stop making excuses
You hit my car, I want $30,000 for the damages
$30,000, are you kidding?
You switched lane without signaling
A guy jumped down, what can I do?
Whatever!
Pay for the damages!
Cross match, CBP, full-bodied X-ray!
Saline full rate, uncross match units!
Get a drill, and diathermy
What color do you want?
What?
A E doesn't have these supplies you need to apply
Yellow is for one-month approval
Red is for one-week approval
Blue is for next-day approval
When do you need the supplies?
Right now!
Then it's the green one, but it ran out
You can submit a white form to Administration or a black one to the Highest Management
Bring it back to the 2nd floor!
Sterilize them
Life comes first, hurry!
Damn!
Can they revive him?
Hope God answers our prayer
Joe!
Joe!
Still no response
8:50, certify!
What's that thing attached to the liver?
The duodenum's got something too!
Isn't that Leon's mobile?
Does it still work?
Dentures?
Someone didn't wear his mask
He did
How is he, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything
Pay for your own car repair
Shit!
Come back to life!
I just paid off the mortgage on my car!
This belongs to the deceased tell the doctors that operated on him to pick up their things
Yes
Let's see what he's got. $1.5
Don't jump to death if you had no money
Why couldn't you do it from a cliff?
You hit my car!
They're the same because we haven't done enough
We've done a lot
Apparently not enough
Can't believe I just lost money like that
What?
You have to pay for the repair!
And where's your apology?
Andy, sometimes one's luck just hits the bottom
You
Sorry, doctors
Didn't mean to damage your cars
Sorry, doctors
Sorry, doctors
Didn't mean to damage your cars
More people are here, don't be afraid
Not afraid
We're sorry!
Find the doctor that did this to you
Let us go!
There's a ghost combing her hair
Then in an instant appeared over there!
Do I look pretty?
You girls never stop having fun.
Order take-out?
You guadvulets most not wonder around the building
People would think your brother came back from the dead!
You gave us a scare!
Thought we saw ghost!
It's safer to follow him
What are they doing?
Fixing our cars, I think
They are pretty decent people
Don't rush to judgement, see if they can fix our cars first
They are admirable we look insignificant in comparison
Andy, you can't make comparison like that
There are halos above them
No way
It's just reflection, you're ignorant
That's true
If good people have halos then should bad people have horns?
That's rubbish!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I don't like educated men, I want someone rich
We've done enough why haven't they changed?
You're right
Maybe they're not aware of what we're doing
Should we make it more obvious?
1, 2
Up and down, up and down, I am brushing my teeth around
You hear that?
They're cleaning the bathroom!
I'll be touched if they add new water
What did you say?
Doctor, I'm because of overworking
I'm not talking to you
Sell the stocks
What's your problem?
I haven't slept for days
Everything is out of focus
I can't hear things clearly
Then there's a blackout
Who turned off the light?
Then I passed out
Should we help them?
We don't want them dead here
We have no choice
Give a hand
We'll take care of you later, move!
This was a long day, I'm tired
I'm done for the night
I don't want to work to death
Looks serious
We have to find something to do
Yes, something
It's not my fault
They looked identical saidtheyweregoingtothecemetery
Anyone would've got scared and crashed his car
I'm really fine
You should treat them first
Your condition worries me more!
You may not feel any pain
But there's the possibility of concussion and internal bleeding
Make way
What a pity, we've got a patient
Another one?
That one sitting over there
Are you okay?
Yes
No really, are you okay?
Wake Joe and the other two up to help us out
Go get Joe
Lie down
How are you?
Does it hurt?
No
What caused the accident?
I thought I saw ghost
Doctor!
Doctor!
Patients are brought to the hospital
They are the quadruplets
Wake up, doctor
Any problem with your hearing?
Give me your hands
Do you feel dizzy?
No
Skull X-ray, Cat Scan!
Any problem with your hearing?
You asked me that already
I'm testing your ability to recall things
What are you doing now?
The bandage is a mess.
I'll do it over!
200!
Clear!
No one to clear
There's another one over there!
You can't just leave him there dying!
Their brother already killed himself here do you want them all to die here?
I'll help you, doctor
Defibrillator, clear!
Clear!
Certify!
10:15, certify
Certify!
I'm the patients' mother, doctor
Sorry!
We've done everything
They all signed the organ donation card
Take any part you think is helpful
Take them to Surgery!
ICU, hurry!
ICU, hurry!
Give me five!
We did it!
Thank you, doctor
It's my duty
Thank you, doctor
Thanks, Thanks
He has heartbeat but there is heart failure
He needs heart transplant now or he won't make it!
Prepare heart transplant surgery
Yes
Thank you
Please help him

What a pity!
There's a complication!
ICU won't take him!
BP 100/50, pulse 100!
His face is pale!
No urine!
Abdominal distension!
Edema of extremities!
Possible kidneys and liver failure!
Heart arrest, Doctor!
Go to the OR!
Don't just stand around, hurry up!
Should we have transplant organs standing by?
Get as many as you can
It's really not easy to be a doctor!
BP 60/30, pulse 100, SAO272
We have to hurry
Organs of the deceased don't last more than 30 minutes
You can't take back the bodies
The patient is their youngest brother!
But the bodies are already sent to other departments
What can we do?
Which form should we fill out?
Only way is to snatch them!
Liver and kidneys need to be removed
How much time left?
15 minutes
Help!
Suction
Stay focused
It's not easy to be a doctor!
What's the condition?
The heart, liver and kidneys need transplant
Bad lung, heart, and kidneys
Bad heart, liver and lungs
Bad liver, kidneys and lung
Do we have healthy heart, liver and lung?
I've got a liver!
I've got kidneys!
I've got a heart!
Prepare transplant!
The operation was a success!
I'll go visit him
Thank you, doctor
Thank you, doctor
Thank you, doctor
Thank you
It's really not that easy to be a doctor!
It's really not that easy to be a nurse!
I won the lottery with the highest prize money in the history!
I love you!
Sorry
Money doesn't impress me anymore
I like someone good-looking
Money doesn't impress you?
Money doesn't impress you?
Speak!
No!
Misappropriating organs is a criminal offense
Write!
No response
He's pissed!
Use Joe as scapegoat
How about someone else?
He has nothing to do with this
Guaranteed promotion and raise!
3 minutes
Give me 3 minutes
I never commit to anything for more than 3 minutes
This time I won't betray my friend
Let's see if I'll change my mind!
Still couldn't get a sound out of them
They're persistent
What are you doing?
Leaving this place
You're leaving too?
You didn't hit anyone or steal dead bodies
My contract just expired
Sir Ho asked me to work for 3 months
It's been that long already
And all these time the 7 Rats try so hard to make you leave
They've always been that clueless
And all this time we fought for you
Then we are stupid too?
You guys are pretty clueless as well!
What are you doing?
Leaving with you guys!
You're giving up your job here?
Right!
Do you know how to drive a taxi?
No
Want to work at 7-11?
No.
How about the bar?
You wear sexy nurse uniform to entertain men
No
Anything else you can do?
Don't go, go on being a doctor!
Yes
Take care!
Good-bye!
Doctor
Who are you?
I love you!
What did you do to yourself?
I spent all my money on plastic surgery
Am I good-looking?
Sorry, but I have a crush on a doctor
Please don't do anything more for me
Thank you
You're really good-looking
How is my car?
I'm sorry, we've done everything
This auto shop is reliable
I hope you can donate the parts
I listed here to it

At 9:20 this evening lightning struck the power plant at the Peak
It knocked out all electricity on the island and caused many deadly accidents
Most of the accidents took place at southern Hong Kong
However, Queen Mary Hospital in the area lost its back-up generator

Pacing back and forth, can't make up your mind
Don't hesitate, go!
You've been low-spirited ever since you came back
Your heart is at another place
Come out!
Everyone out!
Your enjoy talking to me from underneath the cars?
Where else should car mechanics be?
The chassis needs repair
What's with the erect wipers and the flashing signal lights?
Stop hesitating.

Someone could die!
What's your name?
What's your
Are you all right?
I'm okay, just taking a nap
How did this happen?
You won't believe it
When the car over turned the bamboo sticks flew around me
I kept ducking
and this is how it turned out
I'll get you out!
Be careful with that!
This is extremely complicated
The bamboo sticks are piled up on each other
You can't tell how one will affect the other and which one may put a hole in my body
This is trouble
Hurry, someone could die!
Where?
Stop asking questions!
What a pity!
The firemen are busy!
Don't worry...
They're here to help
Let me!
Don't!
It hurts
Be careful with the bamboo sticks!
You should've told us!
Sorry
I'm okay, let me be
Fireman said I'll be fine if there's no landslide
You blind?
Wipe your glasses!
Look!
Let's go!
It's a landslide!
We should go
Where's your compassion?
You're despicable!
I'm not that despicable?
But how can we escape?
Give me your hands!
What?
What now?
I got an idea
Leon, here!
Hold on to this, this one!
When I say 1, pull
When I say 2, push forward
You'll use the saw, and I'll cut the sticks
Leon
Give me your hand
Why?
When I say 1, grab this and turn left
Leon will use the saw, and you'll follow him
Move
No!
She could get hurt!
There's no time for that
No time?
What if you cut her stomach, or scratches her face?
We'll worry about that later, let's go!
I have a plan, it'll work
It's too difficult, there's no time
Difficulty is not the issue, what matters is the patient's future!
It's not easy to be a doctor!
It was him!
So it was you!
So it was me
We'll go with your plan
Everyone remember the steps?
Yes
That's good
One more thing, Joe
You've got the difficult job
On 1, pull 1/2 foot
On 2, push back 3 inches
On 3, move left 1/2 inch
Then pull her out
How about you?
I'll do the countdown
I'll lift it up!
That's right
I'll lift it up!
1!
2!
3!
Let's go!
How come it's not you?
Sorry, I wish it was me too
Don't play games here.
Remember, you made a vow
Life is a funny thing
Before love blossoms, it's already withered
The thought of calling you sister-in-law is unbearable
You adulterous couple!
But it's okay, from now on
You'll take her body, I'll keep her soul
Serena, you're doing it wrong
Told you he needs intensive care
Rub it on his nose ridge and philtrum
Wake up!
Wake up!
Use more
He needs intensive care!
This guy has internal injury
One dosage of diarrhea pills
He has bone fractures, 100 cc of arthritis oil
What are you doing here?
Saving people!
It's wearing me out
I thought there are two new doctors
One passed out.
The other freaked out his mom took him home
We'll take it from here
Everyone stays alert
Nobody knows what will happen next
Such as?
Everybody, because of the disaster tonight
We've decided to help out, the bathroom is in service now
You can use all of the urinals, we'll clean them all
Really anything can happen!
Turn the lights down, don't waste
A E is waiting for instructions
As if I know anything
What if they ask again?
We better sneak away
We are the highest management!
Let us out!
Help!
You rats finally decided to speak?
See what I'll do to you!
You're dead!
Doctor, you have a smile on your face
Does it mean I'm all right?
No, I'm getting married!
My wife is over there.

Take him to the Psychiatric
Cleopatra loved them.
Cassanova lived for them.
The quest for the ultimate aphrodisiac is as old as the human race itself.
Some search for nature's answer Others concoct the perfect pill...
Love aids.
Don't buy it?
Watch as we try it.
"Aphrodisiacs:
Magic or Medicine?"
Stephen Schneider, known to his friends as Schnitzy is a writer living in New York City.
At 49, he feels he is running against time.
I was seeing this great girl a ballroom dance instructor named Jamie, she taught me to tango and fox trot it was really quite cute and we were together 5 or 6 years and then a few years ago we broke up
and I felt pretty bad I have to say for a few years
I didn't feel much like seeing anybody, was eating donuts you know those crispy cream deals, it was bad and I was starting to look like Homer Simpson and I felt awful and I felt the pressure of you know my life moving on
and the millennium coming forward and I thought, you know what, it's time to do something different and find another girl.
Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love inspired the word aphrodisiac.
Aphrodisiacs are things said to arouse or intensify sexual desire or performance.
For Schnitzy, it began with some advice from a friend.
I went up to my old college Ithaca college, saw my old friend Amy who I went to college with, long frizzy redhaired gal, burns candles, plays the dulcimer, just a whole different kind of person.
And she was already into these things aromatherapy and aphrodisiacs and she said "you'll feel better you can change your outlook you can change the way you physically feel, and physically perform and I said 'whoooa, OK and so Amy really turned me on to the whole
aphrodisiac world.
From time immemorial people have done just about everything in pursuit of better sex...
Cleopatra, it was said, drove Mark Antony out of his mind by mixing honey and almonds and applyingg the tantalizing paste to her most private parts.
Casanova was reputed to eat dozens of oysters a day and it is said he once seduced a vestal virgin by sliding an oyster from his lips to hers.
And the ancient sex manual the Kama Sutra, suggests milk and honey, enhanced with the testicles of a ram for a guaranteed night of passion.
The tradition of using libido enhancers may be over five thousand years old,
but is there any truth behind the folklore?
Until the early 80's, most scientists had dismissed traditional aphrodisiacs as frauds.
But researchers are now finding that some do stimulate more than the imagination.
One popular substance that has been eaten, sniffed and smoked all because of its reputed aphrodisiac properties is the bark of Yohimbe a West African tree.
A series of studies found that Yohimbine, the active ingredient in Yohimbe did raise erections in men by increasing blood flow to the penis.
And with the Yohimbe you wanna take vitamin C -1000 milligrams to help in case you have a nauseous feeling.
It enhances the properties.
Oh, OK, whatever properties I can enhance, the better.
They say on the box that it will take 8 hours to work.
Eight hours?
!
So you have to brew it in the morning.
And how long does it last just so I git my timing down?
I bought some Yohimbe in powdered form it's supposed to actually give you an erection for three days is what they say, uh you know I would have been happy with a couple of hours.
So I tried one form of it, a powdered form and basically
I just got sick you know I was nauseous for two hours.
Yohimbe works in several different ways.
One of the ways is to increase circulation and the other way is to stimulate the nervous system.
It does however have some downsides in that it can stimulate heart rate, raise blood pressure and can make one feel a little anxious, nervous and even a little nauseous, so that, sometimes that may not be the most desirable effect
that you want to have in an aphrodisiac.
So despite its availability as a prescription drug,
Yohimbine is not guaranteed to work and should only be used under the guidance of a physician.
Many of the herbal aphrodisiacs including Yohimbine work by increasing blood flow to the genitals.
When we're sexually stimulated by anything-physically mentally or chemically- the nervous system sends signals to the pelvic region the control center for the erection.
These signals prompt the blood vessels in the genitals to dilate, bringing in a rush of blood that inflates the erectile tissue.
The veins then close, preventing blood from flowing out of the organ.
The result... is an erection.
One popular aphrodisiac is Gingko.
It comes from the leaves and nuts of the oldest family of trees- the gingko tree, and has been used in Asia for centuries.
Schnitzy decided to give it a try.
I drank this gingko tea, I'm not sure if it's a placebo effect or not but in my case I defimitely feel like Gingko helped rush blood to critical parts of my anatomy which paid off with a Fin Air stewardess.
In the last 30 years, 300 studies have given clinical evidence that Gingko can benefit the entire body in addition to having aphrodisiac qualities.
A German study of men with erectile dysfunction found that Gingko restored potency in half of them.
But how does it work?
Ginkgo may work by stimulating the brain to release nitric oxide in the erectile tissue of both men and women.
This causes the blood vessles to widen, more blood flows in and we have an erection.
But the jury is still out on how safe and effective Gingko is.
It can have side effects such as headaches and shouldn't be taken with aspirin or by people suffering from heart disease.
Hundreds of millions of dollars a year are spent in the pursuit of pleasure and the ingredients of love potions come from all parts of the world.
Each culture finds its own aphrodisiacs, depending on what is locally available.
Desert plants have been used as libido enhancers for centuries.
It is said that North American Indian girls once combined ginseng with snake meat, gelatin and wild columbine then secretly added it to the meals of the young men they wanted as husbands.
One plant that has been used as an aphrodisiac in the Southwest is Damiana, a shrub native to North America.
Chemical analysis shows that it contains substances similar to caffeine that can increase sensitivity in the genitals.
It is also reputed to induce erotic dreams when drunk at bedtime, but Damiana has not been approved by the FD A, so its effectiveness remains anecdotal.
In Asia, there are countless substances believed to have aphrodisiac properties.
Many of these make their way across the globe.
One is a Chinese herb called Yin Ya Wo, otherwise known as Horny Goat Weed.
What's the deal with the Horny Goat Weed here from China?
There's folklore information that says that Chinese goat-herders noticed that their male goats were acting, in quotes, randy...
Randier than goats?
Randier than the goats in other parts of the pasture and they found out they were eating a particular weed and the weed they named Horny Goats Weed.
And it worked for the Chinese shepherds?
Well it worked for their goats I guess they started using it also.
Well, you know what I always say Joanne, what's good for Chinese goats is good for me.
So with all these love aids available, is there any way to figure out which ones will guarantee sexual pleasure?
Researchers have made some progress by ruling out some legendary substances that can do more harm than good.
Spanish fly is perhaps one of the most well known so called love elixirs.
Made from the dried bodies of beetles it works by severely irritating the urinary tract, sending a rush of blood to the genitals.
Today, Spanish Fly is illegal in the US and the FD A warns that it is a poison that can cause death, a high price to pay for better sex.
But the quest for better sex is often costly.
In Asia, animal parts have been used for centuries.
The testicles of bulls and rams were once eaten in the hopes of becoming more verile.
And the phrase 'feeling horny' is said to come from the idea that animal head ornaments were considered aphrodisiacs.
Powdered rhinoceros horns are still used in Asia.
Even though there is no proof that they work as an aphrodisiac.
Although many traditional aphrodisiacs do not have the firm backing of science, some have enjoyed their positive effects.
But whether Yohimbe or Gingko can help your libido, may depend on whether you believe it will.
Really, the cool thing about this aphrodisiac thing honest to God I'm not positive that it really works but you think it works and it has actually made a change for me.
After Jamie I went for a couple of years and I was miserable then as I started eating oysters and drinking champagne and taking Gingko
I started feeling better and I started meeting more women.
Coincidence?
You know I don't know but recently I met this woman from Spain, Alehandra who was really quite great unfortunately she lives in Spain you know so all the oysters in the world aren't going to help 6,000 miles of ocean, so um I'm still looking.
Legend has it that seafood has been considered an aphrodisiac ever since the mythological Aphrodite was born from the sea.
But some say there's more to 'sexy' foods than just folklore...
Hot, spicy, sweet, juicy, words that make you wonder if someone is describing a great meal or a great lover.
Since the beginning of time food has been inextricably linked to our sexuality.
Historically mating rituals involved having a meal or banquet before sex and even today the act of eating is so linked to the act of lovemaking, that sex therapists sometimes prescribe a romantic meal for two, as an effective form of foreplay.
Maria, she loves to eat, so I mean there is something I know
I can be always giving her especially a good, I would say dinner.
And then comes the romance and the sex is where, I can use that and then lure her in.
Frank and Maria met in a Chicago mall two and a half years ago and the chemistry was instant.
Maria works as a bookkeeper and Frank drives a truck and for them, food is often the answer to keeping the flame alive.
He loves whipped cream and so do I, and strawberries and syrup, Oh, yes.
So we try to make it interesting because you know sometimes if you just do the same thing all the time it just doesn't work.
But historically the lure of food as an aphrodisiac has had a lot more to it than the sharing of a romantic meal.
We have historical books that tell us about the use of foods for example in the Kama Sutra, they describe a meal of eggs and onions with cardamom cinnamon, and nutmeg.
If you have that before you meet your lover, your chances of having a better experience are greater.
Before science began exploring how our bodies work, people followed a premise known as the Law of Similarities.
This dictated that what a food looked like determined how and where it could benefit the body.
So if a food looked like genitalia it was bound to be an erotic stimulant.
Legend has it that the Aztecs in ancient Mexico were so impressed with the anatomical likeness of the avocado that they named the food ahuacatl or testicle, and forbade village maidens to set one virginal toe outside while the fruit was being harvested.
Many of the aphrodisiac foods were just thought to be aphrodisiacs because of their appearances like bananas asparagus, carrots because of their phallic appearance.
But asparagus for example has very rich nutritional value, it has vitamin E, which is considered one of the sex hormone stimulants it's a vitamin that stimulates our hormonal production.
So it seems the ancients did get it right sometimes, because many of the foods that were considered aphrodisiacs actually have vitamins and minerals that are essential for a good sex life.
One of the most visually suggestive love foods is the oyster.
Said by some to look like testicles when in the shell and by others to blatantly suggest a woman's anatomy,
Oysters are also a good natural source of zinc, a mineral necessary for the production of testosterone, believed to be the sex drive hormone in men and women.
But, some argue that you would have to eat dozens of oysters for them to jump-start your libido.
Not all of the fabled foods' powers have to do with their vitamin and mineral content.
When it comes to being a hot-blooded lover, the chili pepper may hold the key.
The spicy substance in hot foods called capsaicin causes nerve endings to release substance P, a neurotransmitter that stimulates a burning sensation.
Our pulse is raised and we sweat more just as we do during sex.
Some believe that eating hot foods can also trigger the release of endorphins, body chemicals that give us a natural high.
And of course there is the ultimate lovers' gift -chocolate.
Used for centuries as an aphrodisiac part of its lure comes from its sensuous melting quality.
If you're talking about like sweets or something like that it would have to be like chocolate syrup.
You know because for one it's sweet, and it's, it's durable, you know I mean you can place it wherever you want you know, and then.
And you know the next place it's going is your mouth so it's like you get 1 and 2.
Chocolate contains a substance called Phenylethylamine which is a stimulant, it's considered the love chemical.
It gives one a sense of well being and excitement.
And that's thought to be a chemical it's very similar to the endorphins that our body produces that give us that natural high.
Some scientist believe this chemical in chocolate is broken down before it can 'turn us on', but others say it may be one of the reasons why lovers will be buyingg up to 36 million boxes of chocolate in the United States
next Valentine's Day!
The writer Dorothy Parker has become legendary for sayingg,
"I wish I could drink like a lady.
I can take one or two at the most.
Three I'm under the table.
Four I'm under the host!"
Aside from the fact that a bit of alcohol reduces our inhibitions, some studies have found that alcohol actually raises testosterone levels in women but not in men.
But drinkers beware.
Too much alcohol, in both men and women, will put anyone's libido to sleep.
Chicago Classic Rock Station, CD94.7.
Hi, this is Dr. Alan Hirsch and we're looking for couples to volunteer for a test of kissing to see what odors and food tastes will enhance arousal.
Just give us a call...
Okay, so what I want you to do is put your head back, stick your tongue out that's good.
And kiss.
Maria and Frank are 2 of the 500 neurologist, Dr. Alan Hirsch has been testing.
Over the last five years he's worked to measure the effect of taste and smell on arousal.
I had heard that Dr. Hirsch uses food to enhance the sexual pleasures and stuff and so I was interested in that aspect of it because I thought that maybe we could bring something new into, you know, the bedroom.
I want you to rate how much you liked the kiss, or disliked it.
How sexy you thought it was, how much you liked the way his kiss tasted, how much you desire to have another kiss from him.
Okay.
We began to study using foods as aphrodisiacs because we found that when people lose their sense of smell or taste they develop sexual dysfunction.
So the connection became apparent.
Almost 100 years ago, Sigmund Freud said that in order for us to remain a civilized society we had to repress our sense of smell, otherwise we would walk around sexually excited all the time.
Dr. Hirsch has been testing this theory for over 10 years.
Up to 3,000 test subjects later he has found that certain food smells are so sexually exciting they actually increase penile and vaginal blood flow.
When we inhale an aroma odor molecules enter the nose and stimulate small hairs called cilia to send messages to the brain.
One part of the brain that receives these messages is the limbic system, often called the 'pleasure center'.
The signals then travel down to the spinal cord, and just like the food and herbal aphrodisiacs, cause blood to rush to the genitals.
The food smells Dr. Hirsch's studies found to have the greatest effect, aren't exactly foods we associate with a night of passion.
Of all the food smells he tested he found that Pumpkin pie was the way to a man's libido increasing penile blood flow by 40%, buttered popcorn came second increasing blood flow by 9%.
And the most arousing smell for women was the licorice candy
Good Plenty.
The curious thing Hirsch's study found is that all smells actually arouse men to some degree.
Women, who have a much more sensitive sense of smell, were more discerning.
What we found was some odors inhibited female sexual arousal, for example the smell of cherries had a negative effect, the smell of barbecue roasting meat and the smell of men's cologne all acted to inhibit female sexual arousal.
Despite Dr. Hirsch's studies, smell remains the most mysterious of all our senses and we are still not quite sure why these food smells affect our libidos.
But for Maria and Frank, the flavor and aroma defimitely enhanced the sensation.
I forgot about the people in the room.
It was just me and him, you know.
I didn't feel like, like it was a study.
It was just and, it made you it made me feel a little bit you know, wanting him a little more, and then having to stop when they said stop.
I'm like, oh, okay.
We can't do anything else.
Vitamins, minerals and a delicious aroma may enhance a night of passion, but the secret to the ultimate aphrodisiac may lie within the body itself.
The human body is forever surprising and delighting us
and aside from the obvious lures of beauty and seduction, the body itself has its own powerful aphrodisiacs.
These come primarily in the form of two body chemicals- hormones and neurotransmitters.
The hormones testosterone and estrogen are mainly secreted by the sex glands, which form part of the endocrine system.
They are essential for our sex drives.
Some, neurotransmitters, like Norepinephrine and Dopamine are released primarily from the brain and send messages throughout our bodies.
They trigger our sensations of pleasure and arousal.
But when the body's natural love stimulants shut down, some people go in search of help.
Mike Albano, a 59-year-old computer technician for the stock market, classifies himself as a "Type A" personality.
He turned to Chinese medicine after his high-pressured work environment became too much to bear.
We live in a society today in New York City that's so fast paced, you have to make it today, you don't make it tomorrow.
It's what you do for me today that counts, not tomorrow.
So it's under a constant lot of pressure that you have to go through every day, and I was part of the rat race.
Mike was suffering from stress a condition that affects 75% of Americans.
I think if we look at the effects of stress on health and sexuality overall, stress is probably the most common cause of low libido.
Mike's lack of libido and general ill health began to have an impact on his 30-year marriage.
There was no communication, there was no closeness and stuff like that.
Performance weighed heavily on my mind, because I knew deep inside that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing for my wife and for my lover.
And the desire was weaning, it was practically disappearing.
When the body itself loses its own capacity to stir the libido, aphrodisiacs often become more of a necessity.
Determined to get his body up and running again, Mike decided to try acupuncture.
He put his trust in the hands of Chinese herbalist and acupuncturist
Adele Reising.
Oh good it looks so much better.
What I did for Michael was I started him with weekly acupuncture treatments to increase his overall energy.
And in the course of our therapy I asked him if he had low sex drive, and he said he did.
It's a question I commonly ask because it gives me information about the person, about their overall energy level and from a Chinese perspective their source energy.
Acupuncture is said to stimulate nerve paths, and some claim this causes the brain to release neurotransmitters which heighten desire.
Others believe acupuncture may also help blood flow.
How you doing Mike?
Great, totally relaxed.
Good.
OK.
By promoting circulation through the use of acupuncture you can help with sex drive because part of what has to happen is the area has to be infused with blood in order for normal sexual function to occur, both for men and women.
According to Mike, weekly sessions of acupuncture and a combination of Chinese herbs including Ginseng have helped put him back on track.
From the very first session with Adele, I brought a list of medications I was taking and she went through them all and she had told me that one of the specific medications
I was taking would have an adverse effect on my intimacy which I,
I totally was having.
And she said one of the benefits of acupuncture that it it flows with everything else and it would make everything come along better than what it was.
And it put the oomph back in to your life.
It put the oomph back, my oomph back with the oomph, oomph.
Our relationship is now more intimate, more enjoyable.
And we're able to get out and do some things, take a walk when we want to.
We're back to where we once were.
The intimacy has improved to the point where has heightened
Yes, has heightened.
And we have the oneness back again.
Some of the body's most potent aphrodisiacs are our aromas not the obvious unpleasant smells like nervous sweat.
Rather, each person has a unique smell print made up of pheromones.
Pheromones are chemical substances released all over the body, but especially from the armpits, the genitals and under our hair.
We are surrounded by clouds of these molecules and leave trails of them as we walk.
Some of these signals smell some don't.
It is believed that they are picked up by the noses of other people, who are either consciously or unconsciously attracted to our smell.
Pheromones act in many ways for other animals as I guess what you'd call an aphrodisiac or at least as a sexual cue for an onset of sexual behavior.
They also do other things.
There are alarm pheromones, there are mating pheromones, of course there are courtship type pheromones, there are weaning or suckling pheromones, so they act in many sorts of ways.
Whether or not a pheromone could act as an aphrodisiac in humans
I think is still a little bit of an open question.
Some studies show that there may be a link between pheromones and our sex drives.
In one double blind experiment young women were exposed to either pheromones or a placebo.
During the first three weeks of the test, 36 percent of those receiving the pheromones reported having weekly sex.
By the fourteenth week the number doubled!
And researchers say it wasn't just the power of suggestion, as the group exposed to the placebo experienced no change.
But, if pheromones are the source of chemistry between two people who are instantly attracted to each other without knowing why, the perfumes and scents humans can detect could also be considered powerful aphrodisiacs.
Some believe that smell is the sense most closely linked to our sexuality.
Although sight and touch are also essential to our sex drive, their signals must pass through areas of the brain known as the thalamus and the cortex before reaching the limbic lobe.
Aromas however, send signals directly to the limbic lobe provoking a more powerful emotional reaction.
But what happens when we combine the lure of scent with the supposed power of pheromones?
Perfumes are now being used not only to enhance the fragrance of the wearer but since the early 90's, companies have cashed in on the idea that pheromones help sell products.
One success story is Perceive, Avon's new pheromone perfume.
Out for only six months in 54 countries, this "mood enhancing" fragrance has become the number one selling perfume in Avon's history.
This is one of my customer Victoria's neighborhoods.
I typically come out here to deliver to her and then I might come through the neighborhood and see if I can't develop some more customers.
Oh right, let's see what we have here today.
I brought you that Perceive purse spray that you had ordered.
Yes, I need to freshen this up a little, get my mood going a little...
Perceive's effect comes from synthetic pheromones said to be "mood-enhancing".
These synthetic pheromones are meant to help relaxation reduce inhibitions and may enhance relationships with friends and lovers.
My relationship with my husband has even changed because I'm happier, I'm more self-confident,
I feel sexier and he's liking that you know.
Oh wait till you see what else I brought.
It's Perceive for Men.
You gotta be kidding.
Nope, nope
Does it have that same thing?
It has that pheromone thing happening, yup.
But some are skeptical about the effectiveness of pheromone perfumes
The pheromone molecule that they contain or the supposed pheromone molecule that they contain, really has I think has not been tested rigorously or rigorously enough to really know whether it has any activity.
And then of course there's the issue as to whether it'll really do what you want it to do.
After all if you splash a pheromone on and it truly is a pheromone then your expectation is of course it'll attract all the beautiful people in the world who will desire you and want you.
But in fact it'll attract anybody with a nose.
While research into the effectiveness of pheromones continues, there is one part of the body believed to be the center of it all.
I think our brain is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
So many things go into our sexual response-what we smell what we see, what we hear.
Our brain is the main computer that will integrate and tell us what we're all feeling and these things will stimulate us sexually.
If our bodies themselves offer us the most powerful aphrodisiacs, from brain chemicals to natural scents, perhaps good overall health and fitness can help ensure sexual success.
In the last decade, health club membership in America has almost doubled.
But although tight abs and firm thighs may be pleasing to the eye, trying to attain a beautiful body might not be the only reason to have a good workout.
Researchers are finding that regular exercise leads to better sex.
One California study polled 8000 women nationwide.
Of those who did some type of aerobic activity regularly 40% were more easily aroused:
31% had sex more often and 25% reached orgasm faster than women who didn't exercise.
But is this simply because exercise brings increased self-confidence or is exercise provoking any chemical reactions inside our bodies?
A vigorous workout can contribute to a release of beta-endorphins also known as 'feel good opiates'.
Endorphins are primarily found in the pituitary gland in the brain and are distributed throughout the nervous system.
They are thought to be connected to our feelings of euphoria changes in appetite and the release of sex hormones that are essential to our sex drives.
Hello, welcome to the show.
We're here to challenge you today with some new ways of thinking about your sexuality, about intimacy about love and life.
Sex therapists Karen and Greg open up their New Jersey phone lines for their regional radio show 'Love Matters.'
They counsel listeners whose love lives may need a little boost.
We have Maggie on the line
Hi Greg, Hi Karen.
Hi Maggie, welcome to the show Tell us why you're calling.
I'm 32, I'm married with two kids.
And both my husband and I are really busy, we have demanding jobs and we have demanding home lives and now it's not that the spark is gone, but it's defimitely waning.
Greg has been a sex therapist for over 30 years and Karen for 15 years.
For them, sex has always been a priority.
10 years ago, Greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a progressive, disabling illness that affects nerve cells in the brain and spine.
Since I figured that MS was going to be time-consuming and energy consuming,
I had to get rid of everything that I figured was unimportant and save my time and energy for the things that were important- so I got rid of everything but sex.
Determined to keep their sex lives vibrant, and to be able to advise their patients and listeners on the latest libido enhancers,
Greg and Karen turned to exercise in their case, the eastern practice of Tantra.
Tantra for us becomes an exercise of both mind and body.
From the body standpoint, it helps us build the energy that we have, and it also helps us, release energy you know that goes into stress and it allows us to gain a relaxation and a joining then of each other.
We think of it as building energy through breath through postures like yoga postures and that this energy that we build is part of our expression of loving of payingg attention to one another of increasing the joy and vitality in our love.
There are two distinct ways to apply exercise to sexuality.
The Western approach is to emphasize the physical by spending hours on the treadmill or lifting weights.
In the ancient cultures of the East however, it is more about the mind and body connection with a very strong focus on sex, so exercises such as Yoga and Tantra were developed.
Like some herbal aphrodisiacs Tantra and Yoga are said to help blood flow.
In yoga there are many exercises that because of the particular posture they will stimulate blood flow to certain organs.
And specific yoga exercises are geared towards improving the function of the ovaries the adrenal glands and the pituitary hypothalamus.
And it's the relationship of these organs together that helps our sexual function flow smoothly.
Aside from increasing blood flow to our sex glands, yoga also includes specific exercises that can be used to make sex better.
Some exercises help strengthen the muscles in the pelvic region, while others can help control orgasm and ejaculation.
Karen and Greg practice Tantra every week.
And although science has yet to prove that this type of exercise can directly stimulate the sex glands, many people like Karen and Greg find that regular Tantra does lead to better sex.
Stretching is really one of the best exercises that I can do because it allows me to be flexible.
And even with your MS, you're actually more flexible than I am which annoys me, but the Tantra exercises help us to build and keep sexual energy high.
For Karen and Greg, Tantra proved to be the answer to their sexual dreams, but for others, dance is a great sexual enhancer.
Throughout history, dance has been used in courtship rituals and often as a prelude to sex.
Indeed, dance often has the excitement, release and exhaustion characteristics of sexual climax.
Dance is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
Many of the Latin dances for example are very sensual and very sexual.
Many of the rituals involved in mating in various different civilizations involved dance.
For Karen and Greg, exercise has defimitely helped to enhance their sex lives, but sometimes, we need a prescription to perform.
Vast strides in medical technology have helped to make the issue of sexual performance a 21st century obsession.
While our quest for the perfect aphrodisiac continues, have we replaced the potions of the past with the pharmaceuticals of the future?
Has the art of love become the art of science?
In the United States it is estimated that over 58 million men and women may suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction.
The cause could be physical psychological or both but drug companies are competing to find a cure.
Perhaps one of the most well known pharmaceuticals today is Viagra.
To date over 16 million prescriptions for Viagra have been filled in the United States alone.
But Viagra is just the tip of the iceberg in the medical quest for sexual success.
Erection medication is so popular it is boasting over
$880 million dollars of sales and new treatments continue to hit the market.
There is a myth that these medications will enhance and create super sexual beings, and I think that that's something that's a risk as well because we don't want to become too intercourse focused as a society.
We don't want to become too goal-oriented.
But to some, many of these drugs are nothing short of a miracle.
After Greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, he suffered from erectile dysfunction and had to face the reality that medical assistance was needed.
His doctor prescribed Caverject- the first prescription medication approved by the FD A for erectile dysfunction.
For Greg, this meant having an injection before sex.
Caverject and penile injection therapy is not scary at all.
Because I'm the one who used to pass out just at the mere thought of getting a shot, and this has never been a problem.
What's so neat about this is just how well it works and how quickly it works.
Not that, you know, spontaneity tends to be overrated but it's nice not to have to wait an hour.
OK.
And we load it in here...
And put this on...
You ready?
Oh yeah.
That banana has no feeling whatsoever.
And the medicine gets delivered and it's wonderful, viola.
For over 15 years, the pharmaceutical industry has targeted erectile dysfunction in men.
But now, the race is on to find the magic formula for women.
We used to think that male erection problems were primarily psychologically, or emotionally based, and now we've come to learn that in fact most male erection problems are physical or organic, meaning that there is a medical basis for them.
And we are just now, we're 20 years behind the men, but we are just now beginning to realize that as far as female sexual function, there are in fact a significant number of medical and physiologic processes that can affect sexuality in women.
A recent study conducted by the University of Chicago found that over 40% of women in the United States may suffer from sexual dysfunction.
The result - drugs ranging from estrogen rings to blood flow creams that enhance genital sensation are being developed at a frenzied pace.
The best candidate for medication is a woman who was satisfied with her sexual response at one point in time, and now for whatever physical reason whether it be a pelvic surgery, or menopause or medication, is no longer able to respond as she once could.
This time of life has caused sexuality, the drive that is, to wane a little bit.
One could only imagine that women all over the world at my age are perhaps experiencing the same thing.
One could only imagine that even Sophia Loren must be you know going through this experience as well... 55 year old Petrina Wells is not alone in her concern.
In fact, it is estimated that over 24 million women around the world reach menopause every year.
With aging and menopause, women experience a variety of changes in their sexual function, being increased vaginal dryness increased pain with intercourse, changes in their ability to become aroused, difficulty achieving orgasm, and those changes are primarily due to the change in the hormones.
Unlike many menopausal women around the world who accept their waning sex drive in silence,
Petrina, set off to Canyon Ranch spa in Tucson, Arizona to consult women's health expert Dr. Lana Holstein.
I see so many women who have complaints like Petrina's.
They come in stating that they really are troubled and frustrated by their lack of desire.
They want an active sexual relationship with their partner.
They're in a good space in life.
And yet they're really feeling a lack of this sense vitality when it comes to their sexuality.
Do you feel like you're in menopause or mid life?
Probably in the middle way through that.
Ok, and are you on any hormones now?
I am, yes.
OK.
So are those like estrogen or progesterone?
Has anyone talked to you about testosterone?
Doctors have long been prescribing hormone replacement therapy for men suffering from impotence and women going through menopause, but today testosterone is the one that pharmaceutical companies are targeting as the next best libido prescription.
If you don't have any testosterone I think you do have trouble accessing your level of sexual interest or desire, so from my point of view, it is a very important aphrodisiac if you will.
In other words, it's a substance that we need to have in our body in order to access that want that desire.
In the age-old aphrodisiac quest modern medicine is finally offering some alternatives.
If you're talking about an aphrodisiac or an agent for lust it is testosterone.
And um, we're just in the very beginning, early phases of understanding the role of testosterone in women, but that is the hormone of desire in both men and women.
For Petrina, the testosterone treatment may offer her the opportunity for many more years of passion with her partner Rusty,
and she will need to follow-up with her doctor to monitor the effects of the medication.
But be it pharmeceuticals or age old aphrodisiacs, the goal remains the same.
I think its part of our human nature to keep searching for something better and as we discover more substances, we'll probably learn so much more about our physiology and be able to discover newer and greater things that will turn us on.
So while our quest for passion continues, most people seem to agree, that no plant, potion or pill alone can promise satisfaction.
Perhaps the ultimate aphrodisiac is love itself.
All of this aphrodisiac stuff of course we're talking about lust you know, if you will, my goal and I think most people's goal is actually love, and to the degree that lust gets you to love
and then enhances love, hey you know
- I'm all for that.
The best aphrodisiac is the decision to be erotic, and knowing yourself well enough to know what kind of stimulation what kind of circumstances, what kind of conditions you need to have met in your own life to be turned on.
You're talking about sex.
So, if somebody feels that they want something, that aphrodisiac is probably going to heighten that sexual thing,
But for the moment I think.
But the thing is, if you got love love is gonna keep that memory all the time.
The ultimate aphrodisiac is love and being with Mike.
You betchya.

Government?
Sons of bitches...
Who made it anyway?
...
They even killed Kim Ku, and I couldn't die when I should have
Since then, I lived each day hoping it'll be my last
Since that day... that day...
Shanghai
On that day, I was to die
I set fire to Japanese houses whenever I could
It was to avenge my parents' death
And then I got caught
Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts
Today, we are here to execute the principal offenders, these Chosun people
You should be witnesses to today's execution, and spread the word
How reckless and foolish it is to fight against the Great Japanese Empire
Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts
Here are the villains... of political and other sorts... to be publicly executed
They were anarchists
That was how I met them
Here's where you'll be trained
Look closely
This is Majaal, who makes the bombs and weapons for us
Hey, don't touch my knife!
That's right.
That's the way
Where are you pointing at?
You're driving me nuts!
Black looks good on Sang-Gu!
Like a bell boy at the club
Yeah, he's the bell boy
Do you know why we prefer black clothes?
If the socialists are red then anarchists are black
Throughout history we only wore white, a sign of weakness
And we should mourn for our old timers, right?
I wear it 'cause I like black
Wow!
Looking good, huh?
Listen!
Keep straight and don't breathe
Look at me when I'm talking!
Hello
Ling Ling!
How 'bout a hug today?
Ling Ling Light them up well with the mirror
Why we always have to take our pictures from him?
It's too damn dull
Still, Mr. Wang's the only one to treat us with dignity
Ready?
One... two...
Three!
Hey, get up for a minute.
Get up, I said
Try reciting our declaration
People are our principal spirit of revolution
Louder!
People are our principal spirit of revolution
Violence is our only weapon of revolution
With our people, we will overthrow the Japanese rule
With assassination, destruction and rebellion.
We...
We will rebuild our tortured life under Japanese rule
And as a first class society there will be no suppression
Without any, without any oppression to our fellow men,
We will build an ideal Chosun nation...
That day, I was officially accepted into the group
Hi Seregay Hey they sure look silky
My!
Why do girls always like his kind.
Drives me crazy!
Wow!
Let's stuff ourselves to death
Drink up!
Those bitches sure know how to roll their hips around
Sang-gu, do you see those Japs, over there?
That's Minami Soja.
He's been dispatched to Shanghai
To the right is Gato, his pawn
In front of him is the cold-hearted Kuboda
You'll meet them soon
When should we kick their butts?
Kaneko-san!
Many foreigners are here
In Shanghai, there's a lot of armies from many countries
So what if there are?
We can crush those Japs and hide with the French
So far, they're good to us, but they have their own moves
Our provisional government is there too and it's best that we don't trust them too much
What are we doing?
Let's drink up for those buffoons
The only buffoon here is you.
Cheers!
You idiot!
You're an imbecile!
Go outside to throw up if you don't feel well, Sang-Gu
Seregay consoled his pains with opium
They're beating him up!
Give us the money now
What are you doing?
We want our opium money
But did you have to...
Seregay!
Hey guys!
Look who's here?
It's the Queen of the club!
What do we have here?
So!
You got a knife?
Let's see what you can do, you son of a bitch!
Get lost!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Come on!
I'll take him home
You're home late
You have a funny hobby
Well, yes, that is...
You seem to turn the pages with perfume
Oh, now what should I do?
I was really saving it up...
I hardly used it...
Who told you to bring me here?
Well, I'll see you later
We'll get an order from above
You just wait a bit, okay?
Hey you!
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Yesterday you got fancy food and you threw it all up
And now you...
You rotten bastard.
You all right?
Sang-Gu!
Go and get the pictures from the photo shop
Yes, sir
Now eat, okay?
Hello.
How can I help you?
Photos?
Photos!
Wait one minute
Here...
Photos
In the photo, you're not pretty
You should smile
Smile!
No...
Have a cup of tea Yes, sir
Have you scrubbed yourself well?
You could get sick without some scrubbing now and then
Yes sir, I have
I need to scrub off filth
What do you mean?
Please get to the point
A while ago, Han Myung-Gon received some subsidy from Lenin 2 million rubles was delivered from Moscow to Shanghai
But a 1 00,000 rubles of that just disappeared into thin air
You mean, Kim Lib took it?
Kim Ku already killed him
Everybody's talking about it.
It's an issue for both parties
Then is it true that Kim Lib's money went to Dan-Jae?
Dan-Jae says he knew nothing, but he received 500 rubles to write 'The History of Chosun'
The problem isn't the 500 rubles, but it's the missing 1 00,000 rubles
The provisional government thinks that we took it all
All the leftists, including Lee Dong-Hui, Shin Chae-Ho and Kim Won-Bong are all under suspicion
Isn't it manipulated by the Rhee Seung-Man's side?
That's why he broke off the leaders' meeting, didn't he?
I heard that they couldn't find that money in the end
Han Myung-Gon thought it was dangerous to carry it alone
So he entrusted a part of it to some guy
But that guy ran off to Russia to keep it for himself
We finally found him
Kill him and bring back the money
In two months, top Japanese officials will be in Shanghai
Probably conspiring to take the rest of China
Is that so?
Wow!
We finally got a big one for us
Now we can make our names famous in history
Dol-Suk, it's your turn
I brought a guest.
Please greet him
A Minister of Provisional Government, Mr. Ahn Chang-ho
I already spoke to your leader, Mr. Kim, and I advise you to stop your terrorism from now on
Especially, the foreign settlements are absolutely forbidden
We're risking our lives by sneaking into those areas
And you want us to just watch those Japs kill our brothers?
Why judge everything only by the things you know?
Thanks to the protection from the foreign settlement officials, thousands of our people can be safe in the French districts
So you'll keep bribing them with protection fees?
Now the Japs will expand their power into these areas
Then it'll be the last of diplomatic immunity
Terrorism is barbarism, and it's internationally condemned
We have to change our society through enlightenment
Look, you think terrorism is all about guns and knives, but that's the decent part of it
The Japs should be hacked to death
Dol-Suk!
Sir!
Let me take care of that damn Governor-General
I'll finish him with my blade
Our guest is leaving
Show him the way out
You fellows think carefully about what I said
Seregay, here's the photo and the address
I'm standing here!
Geez!
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
My headache's worse
Let's get it treated for good after you get back
After I leave, you sleep with her
Help me fall out of love
Before a big kill, we always took a picture
Since it could be our last moment alive
One
Two
Three
You know that dancing lady?
That lady's your girlfriend?
Am I right?
But a gun is more reliable than a knife, right?
It depends on how you use it
He's enormous
Then there's plenty to stab at
A Russian hooker went in
She looks expensive
I guess he's got the money
Will you cut his throat or stab the heart?
You want to be the next Sabinkov?
Find out for yourself what killing is like
I think a stab in the heart will be better
The important thing is to avoid the ribs
Insert vertically under the left nipple
Don't you miss home?
Now it's not home anymore
I heard you were from a royal family
It's been a while since I threw away my family name
I saw you reading a very interesting book
About anarchism
It's the ideology of the person that I love
So you learned the language of the one you love?
I was born in Chosun.
My mother was a Chosun woman
Will you give me the honor of a toast with the royal family?
Seregay!
Seregay!
Seregay only sent me back
We divided the money to reduce the risk
But Seregay didn't come back
And I came back eating only eggs for 7 days
Our leader was furious and ordered us to bring him back
The other members were sent
We were completely excluded from the operation
But with Lee Geun's efforts...
Seregay was handed over to us
Did you forget how he protected us when he was tortured?
He's also very sick, and he's not himself
You shouldn't have saved him without any authorization
In the end, you got in the way of his honorable death
Since then, Seregay's wasted...
Still, that's not fair!
How can they tell us to kill a comrade?
There are hundreds of members besides us
You know that we're being harshly punished for them
Why do you ignore that?
You don't care about Seregay at all
You care that it's humiliating since it happened to us!
Let's stop it there
Please take the life that you saved
There's been a change of plans
Seregay was a great fighter
An activist who didn't need anything at all
Maybe Seregay was never meant to be one of us
I heard the gunshot from the opposite side
I was afraid and the guys didn't know what to say
Those who are here today have no right to mourn
That's because we are still cowardly alive
During last Kwang Dong earthquake,
Japanese had mercilessly massacred thousand of our people
With the remaining ashes of a Chosun fighter in front of us,
I dare declare...
He was in a such a bad state that we had to cremate him
We found out that Minami, Gato and Kuboda did it
For whatever it takes, we intend to seek retribution
Let's renew our resolutions
All members and officials of the Provisional government, please remain to take a photo in memory of today
Everybody, look over here One, two, three
Hey Kuboda!
Where's Minami-san?
I don't know
You don't?
Idiot!
Oh, Kaneko-san, it's an honor for me, Minami
What's the matter?
Did you have to take advantage of Kaneko as well?
What?
I'm trying to relieve the sadness of a woman who...
You made no scruples to attain your goals
You're exploiting Kaneko
Don't forget that hundreds of our people are dividing into nationalists or socialists
How can we bring them together to fight our enemy?
I'm talking about your coldness to use women in a revolution
You said that a rebel is cold
- Hearted as well as passionate
That terrorists are cold flames
You, me, Kim Ku and Dan-Jae, we're being exploited for the revolution
Isn't your judgment these days being obscured by a woman?
You...
What are you guys doing?
For Minami's death, Kaneko was tortured
By the despicable Gato and Kuboda, a Chosun national
They just used you for their terrorist activities
Do you know how Seregay died?
They killed Seregay
This is Seregay
Hey!
Look what we have here!
Which hometown you from?
I'll show you what a real Chosun man is like, okay?
Lee Geun consoled Kaneko in place of Seregay
The group silently accepted that she informed him about the Japs
That's new
What are you doing?
It's Seregay's
Don't touch it
What's wrong?
I drank coffee from it lots of times
Is this your place?
Are you my husband?
And please don't use that form of speech with me
Why do Chosun men do that when they get acquainted?
Use it on your Chosun girls
I'm different.
I'm Japanese
Sorry.
You call us Japs, right?
I never thought of you as a Japanese woman before
Why is only Seregay dead and not you as well?
If you're comrades and rebels, you should all live or die
You hypocrite!
Do you think there's any meaning to be alive?
Christ, those two kissing away like they were long lost lovers
Well, I guess she'll be going
What's up, Dol-Suk?
Oh!
You're here.
Want a cigarette?
Huh, are you leaving?
Let's have a meeting
We've got important info on the new Jap's Consul General
Wait!
Stay still!
You can't go out alive
What happened?
Shit!
Listen to him, Kuboda Drop the gun
Drop the gun!
Do as you're told.
Please!
Let's go!
Go away and listen to me
Don't follow me
Listen to them, Kuboda
It's no use running away
Shut up!
You son of a bitch!
You're dead, you bastard
Take it off.
Off!
You shit!
What are you doing?
To eat a boiled egg, you have to crack its shell
No!
What do you mean by no?
We'd be no different from them.
This is inhuman
Inhuman?
Animals don't do anything like this
Then what's a human supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do in a situation like this?
Just kill him Kill?
Now that's very human
Is this all you learned while being tortured by the Japs?
There's an informant among us
If we don't find out, then we'll collapse
It's not about choosing to be human him or not, but figuring out who you'll be human us or the enemy
There's no choice
If I keep insisting then you'll be suspicious of me
No, you've already started to be suspicious of me
What are you talking about?
Why didn't anyone tell me you were hiding in the bathroom?
My great responsibility for...
That's enough!
I don't want to hear any more of it
Who's the informant?
I don't know.
I just do what I'm told
Bring the electric generator, okay?
What's keeping you?
I said get a move on it!
If you think you're right, shoot me
Where are you going?
Is Gato dead?
Why'd you do it?
Why betray like that?
Betray?
Wasn't it you who betrayed first?
He was shot several times in the back, you say?
There was no time for you to recover the body
Then what was it that we buried?
The real Seregay is right here
So, it was all for this
Yes.
After killing the only man I loved, did you have to go so far as to use me to kill Minami?
Tell me why the hell did we have that fake funeral?
Was it to keep the truth from me?
You punished a traitor and used a woman's grief for your cause
You guys are geniuses
What makes you different from the Japs?
What gives you the right to ask about betrayal?
What is betrayal, anyway?
Leave Shanghai
We hid out because there was a search warrant out for us
Insufficient subsidy, crude weapons and an informant...
Many of our activities failed and we were falling apart
We needed a new change...
Even if you don't eat much, your hair sure grows fast
So is that why your first love ran away?
My first love, Chun-Mae
She had the biggest breasts.
So I...
Ouch, it hurts Hey kid, sit!
Come sit here, I said Sang-Gu!
I'll be straight with you
We decided to move to the leftists' base at Kwang-ju
From now on, we fight for a collective rise of socialism
Now, you'll be reborn as socialists at Kwang-ju
We're anarchists
Socialism is just another dictatorship
What do you want, then?
I want to work and take as much as I can
Just as I expected.
Well, you can't beat that
But it's true that terrorism has no place here anymore
I devoted my whole life to it
You need ten years to match the number of people
I've killed
What's the use.
They replace a Jap as soon as one goes down
Even if we kill the Emperor, his son will take his place
But terrorism is...
All right.
Do as you like
Anyway, our leader won't be responsible for any more sacrifices of young patriots
Please finish your meal
I came down here not to serve nobles and Japs
Do you know what my dream was?
It was to die like a hero with style in Chosun or Japan
Forget orders!
Just wipe them out.
You just wait and see
There's gonna be something really surprising
Then all of you...
So what are you going to do?
I knew for a while that the age of socialism will come
But as sick as I am, what could I do in Kwang-ju?
And how could I lead others?
I'll just stay here with my comrades
Then you're all on your own
Whatever you do next, don't mention our group's name
Name isn't important to us
There will be no more financial support after today's lunch
Sang-Gu, do you know the original meaning of 'Anarchy'?
In Greek, it's 'Anarchia', 'anarcho'
What does it mean?
A group of sailors without a captain
You bums!
What are you doing there?
Come over here
Pay the rent The rent, I said
I'm sorry
Is that edible?
Want some?
Damn it!
You can have all you want!
I heard that 1 00 cooked carps will cure lung disease
Sang-Gu, come with me
You're sorry?
You think our kids live on water?
No matter what, I want my money
Give me the money now!
I'll give it to you later
Don't try to trick me today.
You understand?
Hey, what's there to look at?
This knife is from Arabia
It's my knife so I should know
This knife is the real thing
This is all I can give you What?
Hey, do you know what kind of knife this is?
Kid, what you doing?
Take the money
Place your bets
If you don't fall in one minute, get double
If you make him fall, we give 1 0 times the bet
Shit, what's he saying?
If you hold out for a minute they give you double the bet
If you fall, then you lose
What if I win?
You get 1 0 times the bet
Give me half of that money
I never saw him fall once.
Just give me the money
God damn
- It, you asshole!
Come over here!
Wait a minute!
I'll be back What?
Start!
We won, eh?
Hey, give it here.
Sang-Gu, eat some more, okay?
Hey kid, is your stomach getting greased up enough?
This restaurant is the best and the most famous in Shanghai
Eat all you want, huh?
The guys must be hungry, too...
Don't worry
I got it all figured out
This was delicious
If we get this for the guys, then...
Ling Ling
Where's your grandfather?
He was arrested for being involved with the Chosun people
We had to close the business
It was a cold and poor winter
Just do as I tell you...
I've had enough of it.
Shut up!
Why do you always do that to me?
Is what I say that worthless?
Are you out of your mind?
Then you really want us to be petty thieves?
Somebody else will do it even if it's not us
What do you think, Han?
Sang-Gu, you should listen too.
Come sit here
This Shanghai mob is looking for a new face
We just hand over the drugs and get the money
It's enough money for our weapons and living expenses
Anyway, everything will be over in a month, right?
I think that...
Be quiet!
Who asked you to think?
Leave the thinking to us
You stop there!
I'll tell you about my hometown.
When my father worked as a servant on the farm, the landowner said I was an ignorant who didn't know
what a sickle is
So I took his sickle and slit his throat
Bastards!
I thought they were my comrades
You don't know how important this is to me
Sang-Gu, after this, you go off on your own
I plan to do something on my own from now on
Put your hands up!
Hands up!
Put your hands up and don't move
You!
You put this in, you bastards
Stay right there!
Turn around!
Hey, I could've done it alone.
Ah, shut up
You could at least say thanks
What's up with the clothes?
If you're small in number, always have an alternative plan
What are you doing there?
Come on
That's not the way...
What?
It's this guy!
Now let's make them remember us
For the old timers at the Provisional Government to see
Let them have all the credit What good are they, anyway?
In 1 91 0, the traitors sold the government to Japan,
Now, the minister of the Provisional Government are selling the pseudo-government
Yeah, you're right!
But Mr. Kim's different
Kim Ku's struggling a lot to provide for the old timers
Let's just eat.
Hey!
What's wrong?
Kim Ku beat and killed Japanese officials, just like us
Dol-suk!
That was Mr. Kim Ku
What's this?
Oh, shit!
Let's get out!
In a week, from Daedal Pier at Hwangpo River, a cruiser with Japanese officials will depart from here, then pass through Inchon and arrive at Tokyo
Again, careful how you act
Especially you, Dol-Suk
Why do you always pick on me?
But, will all the head Japs really be meeting there?
The cruiser seems difficult
We do a preliminary infiltration
We make sure of the cruiser's structure and size in advance
Even if we fail, dead or alive we will still make it to our homeland
I hope all of you will take the risk
I really miss my homeland
Steamy bean soup and the girls, I just can't wait!
But security must be tight
There's less soldiers on the cruiser than on land
There aren't many places for them to hide in
Our worst scenario is sinking the cruiser
Don't worry.
I'll kill them with my bare hands, if I have to
Please don't forget about me when you go back home
And Sang-Gu!
You just follow me
Dol-Suk!
Now, why'd he trust you out of all of us?
Why do you say things like that?
It drives me crazy!
And...
Don't get so excited Hello!
They were the best that we could find in weapons
They were crude, but we were confident with that
You'll have your ID papers at the rendezvous
You know what to do, right?
Whatever happens on the cruiser, we don't know each other
Dol-Suk and I will attack first with pistols
If we succeed, then we can all safely go to Inchon
If we fail, the second team attacks
Now we'll really do something for history, huh?
Let's all go back home after this big kill, okay?
We'll go to Seoul and make our way through
What do you think of my opinion?
I wouldn't let you down.
I have a good feeling about this one
Today will be our last day in Shanghai
I'm sure we all have things to do
Be especially careful of how you act and dress
So is this the last time?
Then what are we doing here?
Anything fun to do?
Yes, there is
Hurry up
Here we go!
Ready?
One, two...
What's that expression?
Smile!
Hey, did she take it already?
Did you take it?
Yes...
Yes...
Good
Write a phrase to put on the photo
What's this?
Life is heavy as mountains, but death is light as feather
Let's split.
We meet tomorrow morning at the rendezvous
We split?
Don't we all have things to do in Shanghai?
Take care.
I'll bring the car at exactly 8:00 in the morning
We won't wait more than 1 0 minutes
Later, you tell me what you did with Ling Ling, okay?
You look like a monkey
What's wrong?
Ling Ling, I have to go tomorrow at seven
Don't forget about me, and buy yourself lots of delicious stuff
Consider yourself lucky!
You go back to your hometown
I said, go back!
Have a good life
Do you still think that I'm connected with Seregay's death?
The things that we're doing, are they really our ideals?
What do these things mean to us right this moment?
The important thing is that we're together
Let's leave the ideals and the dreams until after the mission
Excuse me
Kang Dol-Suk
You're a petty thief disguised as a revolutionist
You think killing a couple of Japanese people will bring independence to Chosun and make you heroes?
Your ideals are over
Even after their death, they could not return home.
They failed, but they were still heroes...
A revolutionist is like a gust of wind that blows towards this filthy world from a far away beautiful land
When I got out of prison, it was after the independence
The pro-Japanese Noh Duk-Sool became a police investigator
He arrested and tortured Leader Kim Won-Bong
He was accused of being a communist
After three days of loathing, he went over to North Korea.
Today, I am to receive a medal from the President of South Korea,
Rhee Seung-man
It's an honor of my small contributions to our nation
Does President Rhee deserve to give anyone the medal?
Today, at the ceremony President Rhee and I will be meeting our fallen brothers
Sang-Gu, do you want to try?
Sang-gu take a look, they're all yours
The Russian Revolution was achieved not by individuals but by the masses
Sang-Gu, black looks good on you
What matters is that we are together now
There was an ideal land for us
So free and pure that it could not exist in this world...
From the time of Diocletian.
Roman drama.
The centurion Sebastian meets the christian Fulia.
Sylvia, the beloved of the emperor, surprises the two lovers.
The diversions of the emperor.
Sylvia, who persecutes Sebastian with her zeal, charges him with the emperor as a christian.
The emperor orders Sebastian's capture.
On the track of the guilty.
The martyr's death of Sebastian.
If One Could See Into the Future
The angel of life points the path followed by Death
Do you want to go through?
Give me your hair.
In the Kingdom of Death The clocks of life
The fountain of Fate
There it is.
Your son's life!
Childhood
In his twenties
Damn you life!
Stop his life...
Death is better than dishonor.
Who would have thought that my daily view here would be of a cemetery?
TURKISH PASSION
We should have learned to please, to seduce to deceive to know what is in men to see them coming.
And, in that way, dominate them.
The females of the apes, our first cousins...
Don't say that, I've only had two.
Those females are much more intelligent than their males.
A little.
Like this bit of candy.
And how am I like a female ape?
Are there no stupid apes?
I feel happily stupid, for the moment.
A bad start, Desi.
A clever ape only gives her male the right to mate with her.
That is, screw her.
In the broadest sense of the word.
And pity the poor ape who believes it's her duty and not a pleasure.
Duty is a pleasure for me.
It's easy to see you're going to the altar still a virgin.
Thanks to the bishop.
Your man is delightful.
A real Prince Charming.
The best match in this city.
And the best looking.
And undoubtedly the most delicate.
But when all's said and done, he's a man.
I say polite things like this to my husband.
"I like your cock you bastard."
"I like it so much."
"Don't come so hard, you'll kill me."
"Yes, like that you son of a bitch."
Things like that, understand?
You think yours won't want to hear them?
You're both so crude!
I don't know why I'm thinking of the holy water font now.
The one that's right behind us.
With eleven indents on the rim and one at each end.
When I was little in your arms, Dad I'd soak my hands in them.
If your mother were here...
How handsome he is!
Marriage is like a blank check.
You can write fabulous amounts on it but it cannot be cashed without the signature of the account holder and that is God.
Today's check has that signature in advance.
Desideria and Ramiro will increase the number of zeros as the need arises, because children will arrive the flower and fruit of marriage because from today they are two "in caro una" in one flesh.
They have the angels' congratulations and the nightingales' applause.
I don't know if I'll be able to show how much I love you.
I don't care, honestly.
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday, dear Ramiro,
Happy birthday to you.
Make a wish.
Well done!
First things first.
Be happy, happy, on your birthday.
Ramirito, may God bless you.
May there be peace on your birthday.
And may you have many more.
Come on, children!
Children!
Juanito!
Toni!
My Toni loves me so much.
Look at what I've got.
And for Juan too.
Kiss, kiss, kiss for Aunt Desi.
Here, take this, my darling.
Go on, and be careful.
You had them, but they're mine.
You're such a mother hen!
As you like kids so much, why don't you have one?
I can't have any.
An obstetrician in Madrid told me so.
- It was time I told you.
- What know-it-all dared say that?
They told my grandmother the same and she got a natality award.
They're only guessing.
I'll be godfather to the first three.
You're right.
You end up sick of kids.
Meanwhile, we can lend you ours so you can practice.
Just one week.
That's enough.
Two weeks.
- What is all this?
- We're going to Turkey and we thought...
I accept.
It's impossible.
Why?
Because we're going too.
A husbands' plot.
What about a toast?
To Turkey?
- To Ramiro.
- To Turkey.
Is it true about the doctor?
Yes.
Don't lose heart.
There's something stronger than doctors.
I'll never reproach you for anything.
You're enough to make me happy.
Do you hear?
Yes.
- What is it?
- I feel dizzy.
You don't look well.
Girls!
Come on!
I can't stand the smell of spices.
Spices?
What do you mean?
I was told that Turkey smells of spices, of soup with spices.
- I can smell it now.
- I don't smell anything.
I do.
And I can't stand it.
Maybe your gynecologist was wrong.
First shot of your expressions in Istanbul.
Don't look so serious.
Arturo, I have your camera.
We are in Byzantium, in Constantinople, in Istanbul.
Welcome.
Constantine VI, Emperor of the East called Asia Minor Anatolia.
It means "the country where the sun is born".
In the glorious era of the Ottoman Empire the West invented the image of a barbarous Turk.
This was adorned with a complaisant tendency towards sensuality.
Neither was true.
Europe's idea of us has always fluctuated between fear and enchantment.
Western civilization was born here with Miletus, Anaximander, Heracliteus.
Gods, heroes and the Christian apostles.
The Iliad and the Odyssey.
We Turks are Europeans like you.
Don't be afraid of us.
Skyscrapers are as much a part of Istanbul as St. Sophia and the Topkapi which you have come to see but the city still has that charm acquired over the centuries.
Istanbul lies between two worlds, two seas, two continents, Europe and Asia.
Two of the seven wonders of the world...
She fainted.
She's been feeling odd.
- You're all right, aren't you?
- Ramiro?
I'm here, don't worry.
- Are you pregnant?
- Be quiet.
You're feeling better.
That's good.
Are you all right?
Calmer?
Will he bite?
Will it hurt when he bites?
My name is Yaman.
It means "the only one".
And I will do anything so that you fall in love with this country.
Turkey is paradise, ma'am.
"From Istanbul to heaven." Don't they say that in Madrid?
Coffee, sherbets, the ottoman the divan and raisins are all Turkish inventions.
And who hasn't heard of, or tasted, Turkish delights?
Our baths, ladies and gentlemen, are famous throughout the world.
When you were still in the Dark Middle Ages we lived in a world of pleasure and voluptuousness.
We are arriving at the hotel.
You can rest, or do whatever you wish because this guide is at your complete and entire disposal.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
You see to the cases.
Marcelo!
- Arturo, the camera!
- He took it with him.
- Have you got over the dizziness?
- Yes.
May I?
Thank you.
Forgive me.
Welcome.
What's your name?
I'm still called Yaman.
- Which means "the only one".
- That's right.
- My name is Desideria.
- It's a pretty name.
Desi...
Come on.
Laura!
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
I won't ask again.
We'll give you the all-clear.
You can rest until lunchtime.
I don't think they have a siesta.
We have two options.
A siesta and a visit to the mosques.
Or the cisterns and mosques and no siesta.
Which do you prefer?
A siesta.
What about you?
As you wish.
When the Turks took possession of Constantinople in 1453 one of the first actions by the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror was to bury in this spot the man who had been...
The mosque and its mausoleum were built in 1458.
And soon they were surrounded by a huge, well-shaded cemetery in which the Ottoman nobles and pious people wanted to enjoy in a posthumous way the benefits of the holy man's proximity.
The light, as you see is reflected in the marble and in the ivory of the ninety nine windows with lattices.
That number corresponds to the ninety nine names of Allah.
Once the capital was conquered Mehmed II ordered a search for the remains of the martyr, and when they had been miraculously identified thanks to the dream or vision of a "shi" he ordered the building of a mosque venerated since then by all Turks.
An earthquake which took place at the beginning of the 18th century caused serious damage and it was rebuilt in the year 1800.
The tomb of Eyup is one of the most interesting monuments in Ottoman Istanbul.
As well as its walls of 16th century ceramics you can observe the strange religious behavior of the Turkish Moslems.
The holy man's tomb is in the innermost of the two patios behind a grill through which the pilgrim can offer his prayers or request a spiritual favor.
Let's take a look.
Those of you who didn't go to the Cisterns can join the repeat visit in an hour's time.
I'm thirsty.
- Will we have a drink?
- Sure.
Come on.
How many rolls of film did we bring?
Four.
- And where are the others?
- I don't know.
- Want a beer, Desi?
- I forgot something, you go on.
"Those who tend the bath will wash you at your pleasure.
Not only the Turks use this, but the Jews and Christians too.
I myself did it every fortnight and felt very well.
One of the things the Turks rightly label us as is dirty.
No man or woman in Spain washes twice in a lifetime."
- When is that from?
- 17th Century.
Anonymous.
A Spaniard imprisoned by the Turks.
I'm not leaving without trying a bath.
- Where's Desi?
- I don't know.
In the toilets, perhaps.
Listen to this about the harem women.
Look.
There's Desi.
"If your appetite is for long marrows, cucumbers or similar fruits, they bring them cut in slices."
Is anything wrong?
No, nothing.
A bit of a turn.
Will we get a doctor?
Desi is uneasy in this country.
Aren't you, Desi?
I'm amazed at you.
Someone's coming.
There is the pirate captain seated in his chair.
Asia on one side.
- On the other...
- Seville!
Europe.
And there before him, Istanbul.
Sail on fearlessly, my craft.
No enemy vessel, nor storm, nor calm can alter your course or overcome your valor.
I must be mad.
Slip away in the bazaar tomorrow.
Wait a minute.
A photo over there in the alley.
Marcelo, there.
That's it.
Stand a bit closer together.
- All right?
- Come on!
Right, let's go!
You can come in.
Come and see what a carpet shop is like.
My brother will serve you.
I want to buy cuff links for Ramiro.
I'm going to sneak off.
How did you learn so much so quickly?
Desideria...
You're leaving tomorrow.
What will become of me?
Tell me, what?
I love you.
I don't want to be just a silly affair you had in Istanbul.
Yaman...
I want you for ever.
Pass it on, man!
Christ, you're an idiot!
How can he do that with the ball?
He's stupid.
I'm pregnant.
Who was it?
I don't know.
It isn't true.
And you said you couldn't.
I lied.
When you lie about that, Desi, you have to take precautions.
Come on.
Let's sit down.
We'll talk.
We could have done it before.
I knew that you knew.
We didn't need to talk.
Except for Ramiro, we all knew.
But we thought it was over.
Now I see it isn't.
What will you tell Ramiro?
The truth.
You're crazy.
You can't tell him the truth.
You can't go on living like that.
I have never spoken three sentences to you without referring to this tumultuous feeling which has enslaved me since I first saw you.
I am waiting for Ramiro.
Despite what Laura said, I'm going to tell him the truth.
I've got some news that will please you.
We're going to have a baby.
They were right, you can't trust doctors.
I have something to tell you.
I saw a doctor in Madrid too.
I'm the one who can't have children.
Or both of us.
Although it now seems you can.
What will you do?
That child shouldn't be born.
That may be so.
But I'm determined it will be.
Forgive me for saying that.
It's against my beliefs.
Divorce.
Divorce?
That would make me the laughing stock of our friends.
- Is that what you want?
- I just want to have my child.
Who's the father?
- A Turk?
- Yes, a Turk.
Do you realize what you've done?
What has that Turk got?
I'm sure you don't really want to know.
It's you who has to choose.
You'd break with all the child represents?
Yes.
Do you swear?
I prefer my child to be reared in our home.
Then all will stay as it is.
He's lovely.
- How's the mother?
- She's really happy.
It was a very quick birth.
Here you are, with Mom.
My love.
Will you love him?
Isn't that lovely?
Yes, it is.
Come to Mommy.
Come to Mommy.
Come to Mommy, Ivan.
Ramiro!
It's the baby!
My love.
What happened?
Call Don Angel.
There, my love.
There, my love.
At last.
My car's broken down and there were no taxis.
- He's hot and he has convulsions.
- Let me see.
What happened?
We were sleeping and I felt that he was choking.
All right.
Prepare a cold bath, quickly.
What is it, doctor?
Why isn't he moving?
What's wrong with my child?
No, it can't be, it can't be.
But why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do.
Why, God, why?
Why?
My baby.
My God!
What a tragedy for poor Desi.
She wants to be alone.
To meet again after so long in such circumstances.
It's a very sad time.
My son...
Your mother is going mad.
She tried to forget and couldn't.
Now she wants to think you are showing her the only way.
The last chance to put some order into her feelings.
It's an appointment I must keep.
I'm leaving you in your little child's grave.
You won't miss me.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
My baby.
My baby.
When you come back, I won't be here.
You know why I am going and where.
Just one justification.
I'm mad and I want to listen to my madness.
I renounce any settlement.
Desideria.
Where is Yaman?
Yaman.
Yaman Dunbar.
Orteisar.
- Orteisar?
- Orteisar.
Thank you.
It's me.
It's me.
It's me.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Wait, I don't want you to move.
That's it, stay like that.
That's it.
I like to feel you like that.
Inside me.
Not moving.
Yaman...
We had a child.
He died recently.
Will we have more?
I want you to forget everything.
I want you to be another woman.
But will we have more?
Of course.
If God wishes.
Your God or mine?
They both have to wish it.
Even if they don't.
It's a wedding.
The wedding is tomorrow.
Today the bride says good-bye to her friends.
Want to go?
Yes, of course.
We must buy a gift.
You must go on your own.
I'm not allowed in.
Come on.
Come in.
This is your house, ma'am.
I know it smells of spices.
That offends the educated western sense of smell.
But what can I do?
I'm Turkish.
This is what smells.
That's how I live!
I'm alone.
You were alone.
If you go up on the roof, there's a wonderful view.
I don't want to go up on the roof.
I'm not alone anymore.
I'm not alone anymore.
More.
Sign here.
Right, that's all in order.
Good-bye.
Thanks.
So long.
Good morning.
Hello.
I would like information on how to get a residence visa.
How long are you staying in Turkey?
Indefinitely.
- And your occupation?
- I'm a housewife.
And your husband?
He's in Spain.
I'm living with a Turk.
There's no problem renewing your passport but to live here you need a residence certificate.
Check with your Turkish friends but in theory you need a justifiable occupation here.
Want a lift?
- I'm going a long way.
- No matter.
I think he said we've to be at the airport before 5.00 but I'm not sure.
Do you speak Turkish?
I should make an effort.
It's a big effort, believe me.
You've been very kind.
Thank you.
Hey!
What do I call you?
I'm sorry, Desideria makes it difficult to tell you something in confidence.
Friends call me Desi.
All right, Desi.
If you need anything, I'm at the Consul in the mornings.
What could I need?
You live in Turkey with a Turk, and in this neighborhood.
I think you're going to need something.
- I hope you're wrong.
- So do I.
I'm Paulina Orozco.
You're wrong, Paulina Orozco.
I won't need you.
I can accept this other life because I have a god.
A god to adore.
And every day, every night, he gives me a piece of heaven.
What's is this?
Have you gone crazy?
Why are you dressed like that?
I want my master to come into me.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you more than I can ever express.
That's enough.
Stop it!
I want to make love with you naturally and happily not as if it were a tragedy!
Not like this.
You're over-excited.
I can't handle it.
Come here.
Please.
I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you, I'll do anything you ask.
Me, mama of Yaman.
Son, daughter.
You?
Me?
Me, Yaman's whore.
I don't understand a word.
Your mother?
Yes.
These are my children.
I thought she might be your wife.
Careful.
She's my mother.
Now I find out you have a wife and two children.
You could have guessed.
What am I doing in Istanbul?
I don't speak the language, I'm living beside a cemetery waiting for a lover who is another woman's legal husband!
I am separated, legally separated.
When I began to love you I already had a family.
You kept it very quiet.
I have to have them a few weekends!
What's wrong?
What do you want?
You're burning up.
Are there any aspirins here?
They're horrible.
A woman lived here before.
Not Yaman's wife.
Are you jealous?
Hello, I'm back.
Your lover is back.
What's this?
Three hairpins.
Whose are they?
I found them here.
I never said you were my first woman.
But I want to be the last!
This isn't the best way to do it.
Have they eaten?
Yes, they've had dinner.
And an aspirin and a lullaby so they'd sleep.
- I'm going to go mad!
- Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Go and meet him.
I said to be nice to him.
He's very powerful.
How could you?
Why is it so hard for you to oblige him and oblige me?
Don't you even care if that idiot fucks me?
I've misunderstood you or you've misunderstood me.
I understood you perfectly, Desi, and you, me.
Why?
Hello.
Don't pay haulage.
Paulina, it's urgent.
Check it out and I'll call you back.
Yes?
What happened?
Where are you now?
Calm down.
Calm down.
I feel like killing someone.
- Have you got your passport?
- No, it's at home.
Go and get it, then come to the consulate.
- I've got no money.
- Don't worry, I'll sort it out.
So long.
Arturo stayed at the hotel.
That way, you and I can talk.
Oh, Laura!
I'm mortally wounded.
Humiliated, offended.
Come on, Desi, come on.
Stop that nonsense.
He was just a good lay.
You're here now.
You must try to forget.
You've got me.
You've got your friends.
We'll help you.
I'll ring Arturo.
We've arrived.
Yes.
I warn you, Desi.
Don't tell me I've changed, I know I have.
I've changed.
Marriage is very serious.
I must tell you that.
I'm not married to Ramiro, I'm married to Yaman.
I can't deny the obvious.
That you'll spend your life dying of love for the Turk.
What if I do?
- Hello, Desi.
- How are you, Arturo?
Arturo and I could be intermediaries.
All may not be lost with Ramiro.
But you must be willing.
Look, I will never be me without Yaman!
What does that Turk have?
He's got eyes like this.
And other things you can imagine.
Other things I dream about every night.
That's me, I'm a slut.
I shout like an animal when I'm fucked.
And now please, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
I want to rest for a while.
You're crazy, Desi.
- What's it to be?
- An orgeat, please
Coming up.
- What can I get you?
- I'll have beer.
Anything else?
- I'll have tonic.
- Lemonade for me.
Bored?
I'm contemplating.
That isn't yes or no.
Will you join us?
I'm fine here.
I'm Ivan.
And you?
Desideria.
Desirée?
Desideria.
But call me Desi.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Where are you going to?
- Or coming from?
- Now, from Istanbul.
Why were you there?
I'm married to a Turk.
Really?
To a Turk?
Well, it's been a pleasure.
I'd like to hear more about him but...
- Don't go.
Why?
I'm not on the game.
That's obvious.
Are you leaving?
Forgive me.
Why?
I had to know how a man who wasn't Yaman would make love to me.
The Turk?
And now I know.
- It was very nice but...
- But?
A few hours after we met, I'm a whore.
A whore tied for life to her pimp.
Where were you?
In Madrid.
What should I do with you?
I've come back.
You can kill me if you want.
I should throw you out, put you in the street.
Put cold water on your face.
Do you love me?
I just can't decide.
Don't hurry.
Take your time.
- When are you leaving?
- On Tuesday.
Well, let's see.
To begin with I think you should eliminate a few of them the ones that you like least.
But don't hurry.
Can I come in now?
Yes, come in.
Definitely not that tie.
No, I'm all dressed up.
So what?
So what?
A kiss...
A kiss...
A kiss in Spain is a sign of love.
It can never lie.
Thank you.
The Virgin of the Pillar says that she doesn't want to be French.
She wants to be the captain of the Aragonese troops.
Translate.
The Virgin of the Pillar wants to be, not French but captain of the Aragonese troops.
In France, we have enough virgins like that.
In France, we have a lot of virgins.
If all Frenchmen are like you, there won't be that many.
If all Frenchmen are like you, that would surprise her.
But my kiss of love isn't for just anyone.
A kiss...
A kiss...
Fuck, stop kicking my foot.
Am I not doing it right?
It's getting late for Yaman.
He gets up early to open his lovely shop in the bazaar.
We'll leave when you want.
You're not taking Desi.
She's the queen of the evening.
The queen of the evening!
I beg you to stay and enjoy the evening with the very same ease as I leave you with.
I will tell Alain, my secretary to visit you tomorrow at the bazaar.
I'm sure we'll reach an agreement.
Could you take Blanche and Alain to their hotel?
With pleasure.
The Turks are very pleasant.
Don't think I work in such conditions with just anybody.
Don't think I cheat on Yaman with just anybody.
- Yaman...
- Where are you?
At Paulina's place.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I'm looking at her.
- Why didn't you call before?
- I wasn't sure you'd be there.
Come soon.
I love you.
I love you too.
What's all this?
A gift.
Shouldn't I accept it?
Come.
Take it off.
Don't you like it?
Of course I do.
Are you going to hit me?
What is it with you?
You never understand.
Come.
I want you to know who fucks you best.
You must do me another favor.
A very big favor.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sure you can help me.
All right?
Give him this envelope.
Will I speak bad French, or bad Spanish?
I can understand French.
There is money missing.
- Miss or Mrs.?
- Miss.
Lots of dollars.
I don't know if Yamin...
Is that his name?
No, Yaman.
...knows the risks.
He's been playing with fire.
My organization doesn't like lies or swindles.
Will you have to make up what is missing?
I think you don't know everything that bastard does.
Is he your friend?
Your lover?
Do you know him well?
He's my lover.
And he's a very good lover.
Let me explain.
He does business with us.
Your good lover is very clever.
Very clever.
Too clever.
But sometimes he thinks we're fools.
Want a snort?
No, thank you.
Well.
As I was saying...
He's very clever.
He exports his best carpets soaked with that white powder which you have just refused.
And how did he get so clever?
He arranges it so that some carpets not all, just the odd one, so that we don't notice get lost en route.
Do you understand?
That's it.
Are you comfortable?
I hope your erotic tastes aren't dreadful.
Don't worry.
I am humble.
Let's see.
Get dressed.
You're very pretty.
I like you very much.
Provided you don't give it to your pimp choose a gift.
Mademoiselle has found a hidden treasure.
If you like it, take it.
Wait.
It's called Desire.
It belonged to a beautiful lady.
You're taking one of my dearest heirlooms.
Please.
A pistol without bullets is of no use.
They are very small bullets.
If you ever want to use it on your Yaman fire at close range right at his head.
Open up.
Don't go in there.
What's wrong?
If I ever kill Yaman, I'll marry you.
Look, my friends.
Reinforcements.
Shit!
I wasn't expecting you until tonight, or tomorrow.
Why give to others what only I deserve?
Kiss me.
Hurry up, Alain.
Got a cigarette?
Yaman.
See you at Ali Pacha's cafe.
- We're all going.
- I'm meeting Denis at six o'clock.
Now I'll see if you really love me.
This isn't a funeral, Desi.
It's a party, a celebration.
What's wrong?
Can't you see I want to be alone with you?
Love is like trade.
A good lover must fulfill two obligations.
First, never lose, keep what you have.
Second, never stake everything on one card.
You mustn't risk love in its entirety.
You must keep some reserves, just in case.
If you don't do that, you become the other person's slave.
And believe me, the other person becomes sick of his slave.
How long have you known that whore?
I want you to drink let yourself go, live and let live.
Love is a game which brightens our lives.
To really do that, its caresses must last.
It must pervade everything, just as a perfume does.
Beneath that silk, you both have breasts which are swelling hearts which are racing, breathing which is agitated contractions which you are beginning to feel somewhere.
Love is always there to be discovered especially with more than two.
Behind the knees a groin, the smoothness of an inner thigh the smoothness of the phallus a curl of hair, armpits, cheekbones, lips.
You see?
Blanche responds even knowing I don't love her.
Why not ask her what she does to understand life?
Why are you so serious?
I don't want to steal your husband.
It's just a game.
How long have you been sleeping with this bitch?
You're unbearable, Desi, darling.
With or without your help I'm going to ride that bitch tonight.
Go away, and let this be the last time I see you.
We must leave discreetly.
You must take me to a friend's house.
She has to get away.
She has to get away.
Desi has to get away.
Get a doctor!
Good-bye, my desires.
Good-bye, children I can never have.
Good-bye, friends I didn't love.
Good-bye, lovers who denied me friendship.
Everything is over.
I don't know in which world I belong.
It all comes down to the same.
A humming which, from now on will mark my hours of solitude.
It will be sweet to die from this memory although I don't know

- An éclair, an éclair, an éclar with a whipped cream!
- Wonderfully will decorate the wreaths candy...
- The master piece!
- How is it possible he had the key from this yard when you don't know him?
- Maybe he repaired something here?
- because he's a plumber.
- he always tries to repair something in our house and it is never working!
- But Herminka likes him.
- Don't you know our niece Herminka?
- Yes, yes.
- Well, she asked him to paint our fence, and he stepped into our hydrangea.
CLOSED

- Mrs. Horackova, I need to go to the storehouse.
- I only need a little thing.
- Come in.
You'll wait in my store until I get back.

- Hello, do you have American cigarettes?
- I don't sell those cigarettes.

- Thank you, have a nice day.
- I will smoke a little cigarette.
- A lot of fume I will breathe out.

- ...in my arms I will hold.
- Bobina!
- BOBINA!
- His father once picked up the money for a raffle...
- ...and the police caught him because he tried to hide the money in his coat.
Then his wife spreaded out that he wanted to commit a suicide.
- so they didn't report it.
But they young man!
Oh!
- You can give me the money, Miss.

One moment.

!
- Stop!
Give me my money!

They killed Mrs. cashier!

- Bobina!
- Bobina...
- Look Bobina!
- isn't he handsome?
- oh that's you!
- you saved our life!
- Really?
Thank you.
- We were looking for you for so long!
- Seriously?
- you don't tell me that...
- You were in the drugstore and have read it, huh?
- I started reading, but didn't finish it.
- I have written it.
- Congratulations.
That's great.
- What do you think?
- will we get together?
- What?
- you and me?
- sure, when and how?
- It won't be that quick.
First I need to go to get my sister in the savings bank.
- Yes, ok!
Wait!
In the savings bank?
!
- Yeah.
- You have sister in the savings bank...
- Fanny will be excited!
- She sure will.
- But don't say it to Herminka, it is a secret.
- wait here for me.
- I will make sure to wait here.
- of course, you can count on me.
- Excuse me, thank you.
- Excuse me please.
Thanks.
- Where are you going?
- Is my sister inside?
- Where?
- In the savings bank.
- She is in there.
- I need to talk to her.
- you can't go inside.
- Mr. chief, mr. chief!
- Don't you know about anything?
They robbed the savings bank!
- That's impossible!
- Mr. chief, please!
Come with me.
- Why?
- Fanny is really hurt!
- they don't want to let me go inside.
Please Mr. chief...
- Ok then, come on.
- In the savings bank was saved 149 131 Czech crowns in total.
- That young generation!
- he has 150 000 in here and he fights me because of a few crowns!
- he should have taken the money and leave!
- he didn't have to shoot at Mrs. Svatonova!
- It looks like someone local robbed the bank.
- I would recognize local person, but I've never seen this man before.
- There could be more of them.
- I didn't see more of them.
- ask the young policeman who looks after the beer in front of that pub!
if he looked after the bank, he could have caught the robber!
- The robber had a weapon?
- we haven't found any signs of shooting, Mrs. Toufarova.
- I am not married.
- Pardon?
- I am not a Mistress.
I have no right to use that prefix.
- I am sorry.
- Bastard!
- He had something to slam us with!
- He is here.
- 1 000 crowns is gone!
Will the bank give it back to me?
!
- Be calm!
It will all be explained.
- Poor Andelka, she will be mad at me.
I need to go find her!
- Mrs. ...
Miss Toufarova, you need to wait here!
- Andelka!
- you were right!
We should save the money yesterday!
- You can't be here.
- What happened?
- Can I step inside too?
I am standing in plum jam here.
- Sure!
Please make place here.
- This lady needs to stay here, and others need to go away!
- Where is the robber?
- He is gone.
- Oh no.
- He made up more work for us.
- Where's Mrs. cashier?
- They drove her to hospital, the robber slammed her into head.
- Yet, she is unable to testify.
- That means we don't have any witnesses, right?
- We do, comrade captain.
- Frantiska Toufarova, born 4/17/1903, unmarried.
- The bastard came in from behind.
- he had a good plan!
- because he had something over his head!
- but he didn't know I will be there with Mrs. Svatonova.
- I was hiding under the counter.
- I started to fight him when he shooted at her!
- I was lucky, because this young policeman helped me to move the plums into the entrance.
- the robber probably slipped on them!
- The old woman robbed the bank herself.
- Not the policeman slipped, but the robber!
- he didn't have time to shoot at me!
- as he was falling, he took me down with him.
Like this!
- Mistress, please!
- He probably fell on me, because I fainted.
- when I got away from him, he didn't have the cloth on face anymore.
- he got scared, and ran away!
- I would have caught him for sure!
- but you put the plums into the entrance like left handed.
- Hello Miss Toufarova, my name is Jedlicka, I am captain of criminal department.
- can you please show it to us inside?
- Sure.
I am here for you.
- Thank you.
- Who are you?
- I am her sister, Mrs. Horackova.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is your brother?
- No, that's our friend.
- Mr. chief of the drugstore.
- Ok.
- Mr. chief, please take care of Mrs., ...are you Mistress?
- Yes, I am widow.
- Take care of Mrs. Horackova.
- Sure.
- The plums in the entrance were really badly put.
- Ms. Toufarova...
- Yes?
- Please sit down.
- Would you recognize the robber?
- Of course.
- Can you describe him?
- Bastard!
Criminal type at first sight.
- Pack!
- We are packing, going home!
- before they catch me!
Please!
- Who?
!
- Aunts.
Aunts, aunts, aunts!
- I know why you haven't shown me to them.
- Polar bears can't be seen from short distance either!
- Michal what is up?
- They are tricksters!
- You said they are cutely nutty...
- that they are a little odd.
- Yes!
- They look like they just left the mental hospital!
- Wait please, someone told you some rumors.
- What?
!
Nobody did, my knees are shivering from what I've experienced!
- one aunt tried to throttle me and wanted money from me.
- another aunt wanted to date me in front of tobacco shop in public!
- I'm leaving.
I am!
- farewell, paradise of flowers!
- my dreamt of paradise.
- Michal!
Michal!
- Michal, can you finally tell me what happened?
!
- It's a shame I couldn't show him to you
- such a polite man, you don't see many of them
- handsome man, with good behavior and with a car
- even the dog looked very nice
- Bobina saw him through a window
- They sure will get the money from the bastard back.
- he can't escape.
- that is his fate.
- I have a number of the car of the man!
- I could have asked the captain whether I need to stay over night or no.
- He sure will come back!
- especially when he saw I am very interested!
- Andelka, I don't want to hurt you...
- but I have different concerns right now.
- are you aware of how big responsibility do I have now?
- But why did you try to escape?
- you could have explained it.
- I couldn't Herminka, I couldn't.
- she has beaten me.
- I can't make a fool of myself in public, especially when I have a day off at work because of my gall bladder attack.
- there was a chance I would be embarassed in front of the whole district.
- Michal, that's impossible.
- You just got into a misunderstanding with your recklessness.
- Well, I was reckless, that's true.
- I always believed I will marry an old, ugly and lonely girl.
- I've recklessly kept my word.
- you will never be lonely, you won't!
- Aunts, aunts are everlasting!
- about those two, Goethe wrote stories...
- Michal, you are very upset...
- ...you probably caused something terrible, but I am not mad at you.
- Oh yeah.
- Now, if you love me, take your car, drive to the forest and stay there until I come to get you.
- I will make this work.
- Be quick, the aunts are almost here!
- Where is the forest?
!
- There, there!
- Where is the deepest forest?
- There!
- Ok, bye.
- Bye bye!
- Herminka!
- how come you are here today?
- it worked for me.
- Great you are here my girl.
- What is up?
- I've found a he-dog.
- Dear Herminka!
- For Bobina!
- Dear Herminka.
- your aunt is born for the second time, I was almost dead.
- They robbed the savings bank.
- they almost killed Mrs. cashier.
- and our Fanny caught the robber.
- I held him like this!
He escaped, but the police will get him.
- I can't be held up here anymore, the criminal police will come get me soon and we will go to the town.
- I am a royal witness.
- With all my bad luck...
- it is possible that I made some mistakes...
- even if the aunt is crazy, I will behave like a soulful person...
- that won't make the jackall people hunt me for the rest of my life.
- What are you looking at?
That's a fact!
- Dear aunt.
- I know you've had a hard life.
- you've never got to know...
- safe wave of a family happiness...
- that's what made you...
- to naturally hate all men.
- because men are rabble.
- Dear aunt...
- I am someone, who come to you...
- to make it all up to you.
- That's good huh?
- come on!
- Can I offer you a little of our jam?
We made it together with Herminka.
- our Herminka is still single...
- she doesn't need to rush with marriage.
- you know, such a beautiful girl can always pick from lots of men.
- she's the only daughter of our deceased sister.
- she will inherit all that you see here from us.
- Is it possible to find the robber even though you don't know anything about him?
- Not possible, but it is necessary.
- Mrs. Horackova, where were you during the robbery?
- In the drugstore.
Mr. chief can testify that.
- That's the man whom you were in front of the bank with?
- Yes, we got there after the robbery, everyone has seen that!
- I am ready to go.
- Do you want wine from our Herminka?
- No thanks, I am at work.
- I already took some for captain.
- Ms. Toufarova, that wasn't necessary.
- That's from the nice us.
- There?
- Go, go.
- Thank you.
- Get in.
- Goodbye Herminka.
- Fanny, please be careful!
- Do you have tissue with you?
- Goodbye, Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Finally we have time to talk.
- No, no.
I only came for a little bit, I need to go back to work.
- Then you could go with them...
- But I didn't want to make it harder for aunt Fanny.
- Our Herminka can excellently pickle cabbage and pickles.
- are you married Mrs. captain?
- No.
- Andelka's guess was right!
- Did she give you the numbers?
- What numbers?
- I knew she would forget it.
- Remind me the next time.
- you could catch the robber according to the numbers.
- once I've read that they caught the whole group of robbers thanks to numbers of banknotes.
- Do you have numbers of the banknotes you put into the savings bank today?
- I always write them down.
- Are we going back?
- that's a pity.
- I kiss you all happily my aunts...
- and because of you...
- I will get the mark that I am yours...
- or I will...
- for my money...
- esthetically wallpaper myself...
- and mainly stop singing.
- Michal!
- What are you doing here?
I am looking for you in the forest.
- Look, I have forgiven aunts their sins.
- No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Lay down!
- No!
I don't want to!
- You have to!
- The criminal police is looking for you.
- Why?
- Besides the aunt there was an empty cash box and shooted mrs. cashier.
- Remember what have you read?
- F. L. Vek, but I've looked through that book.
- Wouldn't your dog eat it?
- are you looking after him?
!
- It depends what did you write the numbers on.
- Not on a sausage.
- I will lose everything...
- Fanny won't give me anything because of that.
- You know Mr. captain...
- Andelka will even lose things I never give to her.
- Ms. Toufarova, did you light up the stove today?
- We use fuel for heating...
- Why didn't you explain it to the captain?
- Aunt Fanny was explaining it so trustworthily.
- and she haven't seen anyone but you...
- What does that mean?
- Misa, please calm down.
- The aunt said they don't have any fingerprints, which means they don't even have yours.
- you didn't leave any tracks after you, so nothing can happen to you.
- they will catch the one that robbed the bank!
- Because of what?
- The captain said they always catch him.
- Because of what?
!
- Not because of your look!
- The aunt could never describe how you look...
- What?
!
- You think you are beautiful!
- Mr. captain, he looked like this...
- he grinned so weirdly...
- and he had the eyes of a robber...
- this is nonsense, he didn't have the eye below the ear, he had it normally in his face.
- Yes, and he had the hair of a robber...
- no, he wasn't this handsome...
- on the first sight, he looked like a robber...
- well, this is better...
- his mouth was grinning...
- ...and nose like a bobble.
- yes, this is starting to be more similar!
- his chin was kind of long...
- ears like fly-flaps...
- and hair... simply like a nerd...
- messy hair...
- all over his head...
- yes!
That's him.
- You have a great imagination, I would really like to find this person.
- What will we say to Mr. captain about that you can't find the numbers of the banknotes?
- he will be here in a minute.
- I was looking for them yesterday.
Today I am looking for a number of the car.
- That's your only one concern!
- You think about dogs, while we are solving human life and our money!
- That likeable lover of animals of yours could have been the robber!
- But Fanny, you've described him like a monster and this guy was a good-looker.
- Your imaginations of beauty, I knew your man...
- Lojzicku, did you hear it?
- you didn't deserve this.
- What is up Ms. Toufarova?
- Andelka keeps thinking about the dog, we have real concerns here and she said she saw a smilar dog to Bobina yesterday.
- I understand it, I like dogs as well.
- She saw him after the robbery with a man, behind the savings bank, and I said it could have been the robber and she got all upset and left.
- Are we going back again?
- Something fell off...
- Those are the numbers of the banknotes that Andelka lost...
- Let me see.
- Bobina, where is your mistress?
- where is your mistress Bobina?
- So Mrs. Horackova says this dog looked the same like the dog in the car...
- Yes, she is looking for the same dog...
- she says it is a rare breed that is unknown yet.
- You are going on a trip, Bobina.
- Its back is like a back of a Spitz.
- ears like ears of a Schnauzer.
- and colour, something in between a Setter and a long-haired Dachshund.
- Tail of a Czech Pointer.
- eye of a thrush.
- That's not a description, that's a breed muddle.
- Let go!
...what about size?
- height.
- This is useless.
Call an expert.
- Hello.
- How did you find me?
- I am already married, with her.
- Hi my aunt...
- My children!
That's a happiness!
- You tell me about that...
- Fanny will be excited!
- Herminka!
- You aren't a kid anymore...
- I think we shouldn't tell this to Fanny yet, you know how principled she can be when it comes to ethics.
- How about that?
!
Fanny doesn't understand this, she doesn't know what a man is!
- Yeah, and what if she doesn't like Michal?
- Oh!
I would make this work!
Michal...
- Misa...
- so they call you Misa...
- he is handsome!
- I've told Fanny that I already liked you when we first met by the church and I didn't even know you are ours!
- Well Herminka, I need to touch him some...
- Fanny is so confused being a royal witness, she said Misa could be the robber!
- Well, exactly.
- Exactly.
- Oh my, she can make it complicated.
- Savings bank, the robbery, Misa with car, escaped...
- she can even report it!
- my children, I am going, I need to watch her.
- Well...
- this is purebred mutt.
- Give me photos and look for this dog.
- Welcome home.
- you leave the house, won't tell it to anyone and everything falls on me.
- What falls on you?
- I am looking for the number of the yellow car.
- That's nice of you, but I don't need it anymore...
- But the police needs it!
- Why is that?
- Because that handsome man of yours is an accomplice of the robber!
- How do they know that?
- I told them!
- Bobina is already arrested!
And according to her they will look for the dog in the car!
- Fanny, you shouldn't have done this...
- the man has nothing to do with it...
- the man is...
- a bridegroom of our Herminka.
- The dog is probably made-up.
- Hello, is this your dog?
- Yes, he has a muzzle, he is on a leash and here is a bag of...
- That's alright, we are looking for a smaller dog, see...
- ears, tail, totally different.
- Did you lose a dog?
- It is clear, the robber is someone else than the man in the car.
- I already thought so, because you described him so nicely.
- Do you think Herminka will be happy with him?
- You would need to see him...
- So Herminka doesn't need us anymore...
- Now we are free.
- We will just look at them, and we will be happy.
- What if they find Misa according to his dog?
!
- We need to warn him right now!
- that dog needs to disappear.
- My little native cottage, white lily of the valley, please fulfill my silly wish...
- I want to be a snow flake...
- One coffee with water soda...
- To fly to you through a blue sky...
- You can hardly stand...
- Like a mouse enter your dreams...
- I want to have a cat and an alarm clock...
- Only for you my love, only for you my love, my heart is in chest is suffocating...
- I want to be a lace on your scarf...
- If I were a clothes moth I would become a lover...
- I will walk on a path to your house...
- Holes I would flood with asphalt...
- For you I will be a rose...
- Gardening scissors I like so much...
- That all only for you my love, only for you my love to let you dream about me...
- Andelka, such a polite woman doesn't take off anything in a wine bar, not even a hat.
- Miss, where can we find Mrs. accountant Sklenarova?
- I don't know, grandpa.
- Twice red wine, twice white wine...
- Do you need a pill?
- That would make an addict of me.
- I want to play with breeze...
- Then there will be a gale...
- Glass of wine and five lemonades...
- For that there's a rhyme - the chicken...
- I want to be a white cloud...
- I want to vaporize as well...
- Only for you my love, only for you my love to dream about me...
- ...to dream about me...
- to dream about me.
- There he is.
- What's happening over here?
- MURDERER!
- Misa!
- Misa, Misanek...
- Help me...
Misa?
- Good, thank you.
- Tell the aunts hi from me.
- Sure.
- Don't worry aunt, Misa says hi.
- Thank you.
- What?
- Andelka, I shouldn't have brought the plums to the savings bank.
- Make a place here please.
- Move.
- What are you looking at?
Move on.
- Here we go.
- Misa?
- Herminka, this is the end.
- I won't recover that quickly from this.
- You don't need to give me warm clothes.
- In the jail, the have heating nowadays.
- Misa don't be crazy, you have clear conscience, don't you?
- I do, but it is not a question of psychological inquiry.
We need to know who robbed the bank.
- And now they think I've done it.
- They think I've done it!
- Misa!
- Don't worry, and now...
- They think I've done it.
- Take a biscuit.
- Thank you.
- They think I've done it.
- Misa please don't worry, the aunts are with us.
- Really?
- One aunt saw me stealing money from her in the savings bank.
- second aunt saw me escaping with the money.
- Here, drink the tea.
- Chamomile tea.
- Thank you.
- Better?
- At first, I've shooted Mrs. cashier...
- secondly I've shooted the aunt...
- then I've spreaded the plums all over the place...
- Finally I was lucky enough to robber the bank.
- But... where is the 150 000 Czech crowns?
- Where is the 150 000?
!
- Where should it be?
- Where is the 150 000?
!
- Misa, the money are somewhere here!
- Where is the 150 000!
I would like to know where is the 150 000 and 20...
- Misa, you will break our cactus.
- ...penny's.
- 20 penny's.
- What?
- 20 penny's
- 20 penny's.
- 150 000
- 20 penny's!
- Gate to the yard...
- the pub was closed
- the plums were here...
- maybe the policeman robbed the bank, because no one has reported him
- Good morning.
- I am putting back one witness...
- we don't need her anymore
- can I come in?
- Mrs. Horackova, did you find the number of the car?
- I've looked through everything, but I am so left handed, I think I lost it
- Please sit down Mr. captain
- Thanks.
- That's a pity.
- How would you describe the man?
- Well, more like a shabby man.
- but very attractive man...
- He had a moustache, I know that for sure!
- What car does he have?
- Yellow one, but I don't know which brand...
- our neighbor Tomecek has a yellow car too
- and I don't even recognize if it's ours or someone else's...
- That is alright.
- Thank you.
- Are you mad at us?
- We don't even keep you here, we are too busy...
- That's alright.
I'll come later.
- Do you think I've played it well?
- Doesn't matter.
- I know who robbed the bank.
- Who?
- Tomecek.
- Seek, seek!
Where is your master, huh?
- Come on, seek!
Where does your master live?
Go, go!
- Come in.
- Hello miss.
- Mrs. Tomecek, you were in the savings bank last night.
You had keys from the yard.
- you left the door open, me and God have seen you!
- you couldn't resist the temptation of sin.
- Miss, I've always known you two are crazy.
- I was only playing I didn't see it because of your niece!
- Don't you hide behind Herminka!
- With so much money you can't hide, make us a favor, give back the gun and confess.
- Don't let people suffer because of you!
- You crazy old woman!
- If you tell anyone you've seen me there I will tear you to pieces!
You won't live till the next morning!
Now get out!
- Now you came out!
- Get out!
- That won't fit in there.
- What?
!
- It won't fit.
- Why are you whispering?
- Maybe it was bad idea to want him to confess.
- If the police asked him, he would never tell them the truth.
This way he won't be able to hold it anymore!
- We'll see.
- Fuel please.
- Alright Mrs. Horackova!
- Pour petrol instead of diesel in it!
So they explode.
- What's up?
- Didn't you get along with them?
- I have no idea what's up.
- You can't be so sad over that you didn't find the he-dog yet.
- There are worse things to solve.
- Oh, robber?
Did they catch him yet?
- That man wasn't the robber, they've explained it.
- Oh, who was it then?
- Local person, Fanny recognized him.
- What did police say?
- Fanny doesn't want to tell it to anyone, she thinks he ought to confess on his own.
- Please don't tell anybody I've told you this.
- I won't.
- Give me a poison for rats!
- If I only knew whether the beast want's a coke or it has its master somewhere around here.
- Is this your dog?
- What?
- My dog?
I've never seen this dog.
- Well...
- He's mine.
- Ok.
- Show me your ID.
- Ok.
- I need to fine you.
- the dog doesn't have a leash, tag and a....
- muzzle.
- How much?
- CB-55-23
- CB-55-23
- You prepared really well for me Mrs. Horackova.
- I thought that someone wants to rob our house, I've heard a car...
- Which car?
- What do you mean?
- Mr. captain, come inside, we are waiting for you.
- Do you see me mr. captain?
- they almost murdered me.
- What!
- Murdered.
- How come?
!
- Look what he's done to me.
- Who?
!
- The robber.
- Tomecek drove Fanny over today.
- Why do you think Tomecek is the robber?
- Because he said it himself!
- Fanny has seen him before the robbery happened.
- he just got out of yard of the savings bank and he had keys.
- And when I went to tell him to confess, he said he will murder me if I tell you a word about it.
- Today he was looking after us, swearing and then he drove Fanny over.
- Miss, did you recognize Tomecek in the car?
- No, but I recognized the car of Tomecek's!
- They call you.
- What happened?
- Criminal police is here.
- Damned old women.
- Play for me.
- I am sorry if I disturb you, I am captain Jedlicka.
- We only need some information from you, please sit down.
- Where did you go by your car today afternoon?
- I don't have a car.
- You don't have any car?
- I sold my car one month ago.
- I have the confirmation here somewhere.
- No no, don't look for it.
It's ok.
- You don't use the car anymore at all?
- No, not at all.
- Look, Mr. Tomecek...
- Just to make it clear, were you in the savings bank when the robbery happened?
- What would I do there?
!
- That's what I am asking you.
- That's nonsense!
- I've never been on yard of the savings bank.
- I never knew it was the yard of the savings bank...
- but we have information about you being on the yard
- She's a sclerotic old woman!
- she doesn't remember what happened one hour ago...
- but that I was on the yard during the robbery, she's bound to know?
!
- Well even if Miss Toufarova is mistaken...
- I still don't understand why did you threaten her you would murder her if she told us about this.
- She could make a total loser of me
- How?
- She says I robbed the savings bank
- You can't be mad at her for this, she's noticed you had keys from the yard
- Tell me what did you have the keys for?
- That's alright, he was with my wife
- that yard is common and I was at work for the whole night that day.
- so he has alibi
- he is innocent.
- So, Mr. Tomecek is innocent, he was on the yard because he had some personal affairs.
- Woman!
- Innkeeper?
- No, she's married!
- Well...
- it is not nice.
- That is starting to be complicated.
- I know.
Is this the man you've seen?
- No.
- No.
- Fanny said he looked like a bastard.
- And this is handsome man.
- But not as handsome as the one Mrs. Horackova saw, right?
- Yeah.
- By the way...
Mr. chief has seen the man with the dog as well?
- No, Mr. chief was in the storehouse
- I went to get him after they refused to let me meet Fanny.
- It is not easy to cooperate with you.
- Hello Mrs. Horackova.
Still nothing about the dog.
- Thank you Mr. chief!
I will come to your store in a bit.
- Why are you talking to her?
She made me look like an idiot.
- If I didn't sell my car, I would be prime suspect.
- Misa needs to hide somewhere!
The police has a photo of him.
- what?
- P-O-L-I-C-E
- I don't have time to explain this to you now...
- Fanny got knocked down by a yellow car with the murderer in it.
- and the police is so incapable, they want to mark Michal as the robber.
- That is my gall bladder.
- Gall bladder!
- my nerves!
- that's because I don't eat anything!
- Don't try to deceive me.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
!
- I was scared, here, with the door locked, under my covers.
- Stop lying!
You wanted to drive the aunt over!
- and you know why!
- No!
- You will pack your teeth brush, pyjamas...
- and you will either move to a cave in the forest, or you will report yourself!
- I want this to be finally over!
- I have my pyjamas!
- Then you can go!
- I am going!
- Don't try to think that I will wait for you until you get back from jail.
- I am not trying to think so.
- Where am I going?
- when the police is chasing after me...
- where am I going?
- Down there to the aunts
- the guns are barking there...
- and the desperate men are lost there...
- and from the hands of the aunts, only few people return...
- down there where the aunts live...
- a quiet jail is waiting for me...
- and where the cakes are made...
- the aunts will chase after me again...
- when I will have the goal...
- to become an aunt...
- down there where the aunts live...
- that's my final destination.
- Misa!
- That's so kind of you that you are here!
- Herminka is crazy.
- It is probably a hereditary taint.
- Aunts, you are the only two wise human beings, where can I go to.
- That was an amazing idea of Herminka's!
- Give me a kiss.
- If it's necessary, you'll hide in the shed.
- More, more kisses...
- We will bring food in there for you!
- Oh, a tree.
- Misa!
Look out.
- We will also bring food for this little dog.
- Everything will be fine!
- Just don't stand by the windows.
- You don't have to care about your car, everything will be fine.
- we will hide it behind the shed.
- It won't even be necessary!
- I've written down the numbers of the car that drove me over.
- Fanny, I admire you.
- CB-30-01, what will we do?
!
- God, what will we do?
!
- Lock him.
- Misanek, you can turn the heater on.
- if you are cold, there is diesel heating.
- Stay there.
- We got him.
- Now what?
I AM IN THE STOREHOUSE
- He is probably on the yard.
- I will tell you who robbed the savings bank.
- Who?
- Those two old women.
- The yellow car is parked behind their shed.
- I knew that.
- Take the car and quickly drive away, some people here are alergic for yellow cars.
- You said it is the best colour.
- Sometimes, not right now.
- Can I keep it at home?
- It is yours.
- Wilda...
- Mr. chief, what are we supposed to do?
You are the only ingelligent man we can trust.
- I'll be right back at the drugstore.
- Look, here's a yellow car.
- Don't confuse it.
- Mr. chief, we caught the robber, right now.
- Here's the number of his car.
- Can you imagine, how terrible it is...
- he is a member of our family.
- How is this possible?
CB-55-23...
- Why is this car here?
- Hand me that paper.
- No!
- Give me that paper!
- I won't!
- Give me that.
- No.
- Mr. chief, what are you doing?
- I am telling you to give it to me!
- Mr. chief!
- For the robbery you will get around 6 years...
- but for double homicide you will get a death penalty
- you either have read bad detective stories, or your nerves are not fine.
- That robbed had the same shoes like Mr. chief...
- Mr. captain, we have another robber at home in the shed...
- with a yellow car.
- That is a fiancé of your niece, isn't he?
- I just don't understand that the number of his car is the same like the number on the paper...
- Fanny, that second number was of the car with the man, when we didn't know it was our Misa yet.
- The first number is a number of the yellow car that Tomecek sold to a miss of Mr. chief.
- I always confuse everything...
- It is alright Mrs. Horackova.
- You know...
- the worst thing was, you gave Mr. chief awesome alibi.
- But I was in the drugstore during the robbery.
- With Mr. Chief?
- See?
- He was in the storehouse.
- But still, you've caught the robber.
- Because of his shoes.
- No.
- Because of the numbers of the banknotes
- which Mr. chief handed over with his takings.
- you know, Mrs. Horackova, he wasn't as intelligent, as you might think.
- I've robbed the savings bank...
- drove aunt over...
- set fire on the shed.
- do what you need to do.
- For the first two things we caught someone better.
- How did you do this?
- My aunts...
- I wanted to turn the heating on...
- as I was locked in there...
- and in the jerry can for diesel, was gasoline...
- How is that possible?
- We will ask Mr. chief.
- Don't worry, Misa!
- The most important is, everything is alright, even Mrs. cashier!
- Be happy that you are healthy!
- Misa!
Misa!
- Let me go!
- Don't you worry!
I've decided that I will wait for you until you get back from the jail.
- Nothing really happened.
- We will repair the shed easily now, when we have a man in the house.
- And Bobina will have her bridegroom as well.
- We will do with Fifinka...
- what is in our power.

Menelaus, king of Sparta, departing to visit the court of his brother Agamemnon takes leave of his wife Helen, who was famous for her extraordinary beauty.
Paris, son of the Trojan king, comes to the court of Menelaus and in his absence is greeted by Helen.
The young Trojan has made a deep impression on the beautiful Helen, with his magnificent retinue and the offering of more than royal Oriental treasures, so unknown to the Spartan people.
The loyal slave of Menelaus, who spied on the Queen and Paris when Venus, the goddess of love, covered them with her veil, brings the message to the king of his wife's infidelity.
Carried by the god Zephyrus, representing the soft wind of love in the fable lore, ...Helen is transported to Troy, there to be received with royal honours at Paris' side.
The joint Greek monarchs decide to exterminate Troy, and so avenge the indignity that Paris, the king's son, has inflicted upon one of the bravest Spartan monarch.
While the luxurious daily routine continues during the 10 year siege of Troy, ...a message is brought that another tremendous attack by the besiegers has been beaten off.
end of the first part
THE FALL OF TROY second part
Since the Greeks could not overcome the city by force, it is decided to resort to cunning.
A number of soldiers was hidden in a wooden horse of great proportions and by quick departure of the troops it was made as if the siege has been broken.
The trick has worked.
The Trojans think that the Greeks have fled in a hurry and even left behind the statue dedicated to one of their gods.
The Trojans decide to bring the horse, this idol of the Greeks, ...inside the walls of Troy for the appeasement of their own gods.
The colossal size of the horse makes it necessary that a part of the fortress wall must be torn down, a gap which the Trojans in their flush of victory fail to repair.
Ulysses the brave and cunning Greek, to whose brain occurred the trick, reports that the plan has worked.
The wall has been torn down;
the horse in which the soldiers are hidden, is in the city.
Now continue the attack on Troy.
The Greek soldiers, the living contents of the wooden horse, ...begin their destructive work by setting fire to Troy in several places.
Through the gap that the Trojans had made to bring in the horse, ...now enter the Greek soldiers, and surprise the Trojans, already frightened by the fire.

Moscow, the city of 1,000 bells.
The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church.
I want...
Want a divorce from my wife.
My wife loves another and I...
I do not want to be an obstacle to their happiness.
A marriage blessed by the Church is sacred and indissoluble!
The law allows divorce in only three cases...
If one spouse does not show any sign of life for 5 years.
If there is a disability in the marriage...
In the case of duly proved adultery!
But keep in mind...
Three beings coexist: my wife and I and a third person...
Among us there is such great tension, the conflict of feelings so painful,
That divorce is the only possible solution!
What should I do?
Each one carries the cross imposed by the Lord!
In a similar case,
What remains to a mere mortal?
The law...
Excuse me...
Do you still want to get a divorce?
It's simple...
Adultery with a police report.
Only a hotel room, three witnesses, and a "lady."
Who are these people?
These are the "witnesses."
Artemjew, "expert in divorce."
Those are the "ladies."
Do you want to be with or without police?
With a policeman, it will be five rubles, but it is safer.
It's disgusting!
Dear Lisa!
Victor Karenin and you are in love.
I do not want to change your life.
You will not see me again.
I free you, and I want to be free, too.
Farewell, be happy.
Fedya.
In the home of the Protassov's.
Sacha's sister Lisa.
Anna Pavlova, Lisa's mother.
Has Fedja arrived?
No!
Karenin.
Chamberlain Victor Karenin.
I got a brief recess from a session...
So I came for a moment.
I came directly from a session...
Then stay for dinner!
Dad, please...
Stop it, Dad.
Do you want to finish?
My name is Petuchkov, nicknamed "the good genie."
What do you want?
I can provide a revolver for a price.
I have no intention of committing suicide.
Why then the farewell letter?
Once again, you have made Lisa cry!
This house has become a living hell!
We avoid each other, we are at our limits.
Where are you going?
Are you pushing Lisa and Karenin into each other's arms?
They love each other.
You must understand me ...
I cannot lie or hide ...
And above all, I do not want to be an obstacle to the happiness of others.
With the gypsies, life is taken more lightly.
I love you.
I do not wish, nor will wish, to change your life.
I shall not return again.
I free you and myself, too.
From Fedor Vassiliévitch.
I've always loved Fedja, and I love him now,
But I hate you!
So, you have come here!
It's outrageous!
Get your coat.
Your wife sent me.
I have to say ... she is waiting for you outside.
I pray you to forget everything and return home.
I will not go back on my decision.
He came to convince me to return to my wife.
She is crying.
You should go see her, and return.
Did you say "Must"?
I think otherwise.
Some days later.
What do you want from me?
To make a divorce possible!
So - a hotel room, 3 witnesses, and a "lady"?
We live in a state that has its laws ...
Put yourself in the place of Lisa ...
I am incapable of lying.
I cannot act in this odious comedy.
For Lisa ...
Okay, I will do everything that you ask of me.
The hotel room.
The witnesses.
The police.
The "lady".
Do we really have to go through everything .. down to every detail?
Sure!
We cannot give false testimony.
It's not our style!
This client is very nervous.
An idealist.
I think it is time.
Did you not even taste a little?
Police Report:
The signatories testify under oath that they
have surprised Mr. Fedor Vassiliévitch Protassov in the Hotel "The White Angel"
in the company of a lady, being guilty of adultery,
as one of the requirements of paragraph 286 ...
You understand me.
This I cannot do.
Totally impossible!
I cannot even want to lie.
I will not lie!
Go to hell!
If only there were grounds for divorce ...
He will do everything necessary; he has given me his word.
I hate lying and I refuse to act in an odious comedy.
I find it easier to die.
You should get married to be happy.
I am stopping you from getting married, therefore I must die.
When you receive this letter I shall no longer be living.
Don't you want to die?
I would say that you do not need this, right?
Go to hell, damned demon!
Police Report:
A week ago some clothes were found on the banks of the Moscow River as well as documents belonging to Mr. Fedor Vassilievitch Protassov.
A portfolio contained a letter explaining his reasons for suicide.
Three days later, a body was found.
Are you coming to identify the body?
Show this lady the body of Mr. Protassov.
You could open the window, stupid!
We can certify that she recognizes the corpse.
Come quickly ...
My parents will wake up and lock me in!
I cannot go with you.
I'm dead now ...
I'm a drowned man who has already been buried.
A man without documents, an outlaw.
I am a living corpse.
You cannot join me in the life that awaits me.
You must believe me and let me go alone.
How dear he has become since he died.
Everything was so uncertain, and now ... everything is clear.
It is forbidden to sleep here!
Completing her year of mourning,
Mrs. Lisa Protassov, widow of Fedia Vassilievitch Protassov, who died in tragic circumstances, will marry the State Councilor Chamberlain,
In the outskirts of Moscow.
In the slums of Moscow.
Why are you beating that animal?
You'll kill it!
A raid!
A raid!
Those who do not have their documents, get out!
Come, let us go to the cafe.
I have money.
It is absurd; he drowned.
It has been a long time since he died and was buried.
Someone could get some money ...
Since you are alive, and since your wife has remarried ...
We have a fortunate situation on our hands.
Mr. Karenin is very rich.
Blackmail?
Here is a living corpse!
I admire his punctuality.
Always arrive on time, just for dinner.

He's alive!
God, When did you leave me alone?
The law.
The law.
THE LAW.
I'll never leave you!
I'll go with you to Siberia!
Who would want such a man?
He is a ridiculous figure!
I am not guilty.
I wanted everything to be better ...
LAW.
When asked ... carry out the identification of the corpse ...
Why did you say you recognized your husband?
I was so convinced ... and so nervous also ...
Your name?
Your name, profession, confession?
How can you ask such dumb things?
You already know!
Three people ... waging a painful moral battle outsiders can never understand!
Only a divorce could clear that tension ...
Freedom!
But you place many obstacles in the way of that freedom!
So I found a way out ... without dying.
An exit that would have been distressing and painful.
I ruined my life.
MY LIFE!
All alive are relieved and happy.
To survive a vile individual, a hustler ...
I have suffered, that is why I'm here.
Do you admit your guilt?
I wonder if he acknowledges his guilt!
The prosecutor.
First, the will of an individual.
Furthermore, the law.
Naturally, the law comes first!
The law is intangible.
The interest of the State requires punishment for a crime.
The defense.
What about the accused?
Is there some trial here with a crime and a criminal?
No, we have before us some unhappy beings.
Who could leave this room illuminated by the sagacity of this judgment.
They have recognized their faults ... and begin a new and happy life.
We must help.
The court retires to deliberate.
What might be the harshest sentence?
Banishment to Siberia, for your wife and for you.
What about the best?
A penance and, of course, the restoration of the marriage.
The jury room.
The judges's chamber.

Petar, the terrible lion came in my dream and ate me, but Childs voice awoke me.
I want to see that child.
Your son will be great man.
Take good care of him and always remember what I told you.
Years were passing by.

There are words at the back.
Goat' Turkey' Pig do you know them?
I have a lot of fans in the past so I am not sure.
But look at the date!
It is the day when I was killed!
What?
That means that if we find them there might be clues?

Chan Siu Dip said 3 people murdered her and there's 3 people here!
Chan Siu Dip said

Her ghost told us!
Ghost?

Even if the detective won't help I will still help you .
Maybe the killers have already left Malaysia!
We can't find them no matter how we try!
That doesn't mean we can let the killers go!
I believe in justice!
If there is justice how come I was killed like that?

We also want to look for them!

OkOkOk
See?
Listen to the detective and don't cause any trouble!
I can't help you with anything!
Who is guy who killed himself?
His name is Yang Yau Jing, nickname is the Goat.
Goat
Goat is really dead?
I have heard that he is a gambler with a lot of debts.
In the end he hangs himself.
Hey, let me tell the truth I don't want to participate anymore.
You are giving up now?
I haven't thought that it would lead to a death I don't want to continue anymore.
Hey now that Ah Ngau quit what shall we do now?
Sorry Ah Man I think we are not going to continue too.
We are leaving.
Hey guys'
It's alright' if they don't want to help anymore I won't blame them.
Goat is dead
Ngau and the others are gone' I don't know if I am still able to help you alone
If you still want to help me can you please take me to the forest?
What?
I thought you can't leave the house?
If there's any danger...
Please help me one more time.
I think I have been here before.
What?
Try to remember if you truly have been here.
I was killed here!
Let's look around then.
I think this is the grave
What?
Try to think clearer.
So they are the people who killed you.
I should have been buried here' but where are my bones?
Someone must have dug it up before us.
Why do they do that?
They need to destroy the evidence I think the person who dug up your bones is the one who killed Goat.
Hey what happened?
Are you alright?
The sun is coming up
Are you alright?
Can you hold on?
I think I can.
It's my fault!
I shouldn't have let you leave the house.
I demanded you to take me out!
I actually need to thank you for helping me.
But we still haven't found anything useful I am already very happy that you help me all you could
Why do you say that?
You look very much like my boyfriend.
His name is Ah Cheung and he has always treated me very well.
When I was killed he cannot accept it and killed himself!
Bao Gung, why are you only eating so little?
Are you even full?
It's fate how much we can eat as long as one is happy who cares?
You don't need to save so much!
Your house has changed hands so many times and everyone in it dies a horrible death!
Everybody knows it is haunted!
What are you trying to say?
I said your house is haunted' who dares to live in there?
My house is haunted?
What then?
Right!
We are not asking you to live there!
I don't want to live there!
Let me help you find a monk to exorcise the ghost and then wait for the government to redevelop it.
You will receive millions and won't need to work again!
I have promised Sei Gor I will never sell.
I tell you' if I sell it will be torn down
How can i treat my guests then?
where can I let my friends stay then?
Bao Gung, think about it, it is very beneficial to you...
No' it is beneficial to you .
How can something be so beneficial?
You will know the truth in a few years!
Just like the old teaching
Don't be greedy!
Listen to me' Bao Gung!
Hey what are you doing?
Leave!
Get out!
I haven't played on the swing for a long time.
Ah Cheung used to let me play on the swing all the time.
You thinking of something?
No I am not.
Missing your girlfriend?
I realized that I have accused her of something she hasn't done.
When I realized my mistake it is already too late
Even though we can't be together seeing you makes me feel like I am looking at Ah Chueng again.
I hope that when you see this photo you will think like me and
What?
I hope that when you see this photo
Human and ghosts' we shouldn't mingle!

Ghost!
He is a ghost!
What?
I am not a ghost.
He said you are a ghost.
Why are you suddenly saying that I am a ghost?
Aren't you a ghost?
No he isn't.
I thought he is but he went out to the sun and it didn't affect him .
Then why do you say that you can't see his shadow in the mirror?
Now I can but just now I really can't see his shadow.
That's a painting.
Che
He is not a ghost.
If you are not a ghost then why were you chasing me?
Right!
I am not a ghost.
I was going to bring you the newspaper but hit my head I was going to bring you the newspaper but hit my head' look!
Newspaper
We are
Ghosts!
The traffic accident I saw that day it happened to you guys' you are still in a coma in a hospital.
That means that your soul have left the body' then you are ghosts!
Why have I become a ghost?
That's impossible!
That's crazy!
If I wrote it in a novel no one would believe it!
That's reality for you.
Hey!
What are you doing now?
It's time to do something!
Hey, maybe they can still be saved!
They are still in the hospital if you stop the 'Clock of life' then they will be dead for sure!
It's all your fault!
Why do you still let them walk around when their time is up?
Can you be more compassionate?
I am doing this to let her understand!
Help her then!
Why must you be so stubborn?
She is a ghost' not human.
You are being mean!
That's me if you don't like it don't talk to me!
Hey!
Wake up!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wake up!
What now?
They seem to be dying!
Ah!
Are you alright?
Hey, be careful!
Actually you look better than alright!
Have you taken Viagra?
I don't know what happened!
I don't know suddenly I felt full of energy!
Alright!
It's great that you are feeling better.
Siu Dip and I have been to Sriracha!
That's the place where she is buried
Not only that we found out that Goat'
Turkey and Pig killed Siu Dip!
I always thought there's something strange about them !
Then why don't you say that before?
Hey!
I have an idea let's find the detective for help!
Yes great!
Let's do that now!
Hey, although you seem alright now you are actually still in a coma in a hospital!
You two are half dead how can you help?
No.
We must continue to help.
Why?
Since we are already half dead we must help her now!
A person will either go to heaven or to hell when one dies.
So?
What does that mean?
It means that we have done a lot of wrong in our life what if we are cast to hell?
That's why we need to help Siu Dip so that we can go to heaven!
Then may I ask what wrong have you done in your life?
I stole money from my mother!
I cheated in exams.
I stole my brother's underwear!
I haven't paid for my meal once.
I peek at my father having an affair with a woman.
Huh, I have touched my stepmother's ass.
I have had sex with my sister's boyfriend .
I have peeked at her sister taking a shower.
You sick bastard!
It's better than you telling me that you are a virgin!
You also told me you are a virgin!
Why talk about this now?
We are the same!
Jerk!
You are the jerk!
Everyone in your family is a jerk!
Everyone in your house is a jerk!
That's why we decide to help Siu Dip.
Alright, hallelujah and god bless you!
Don't run!
Hey, wait' what are you doing?
I think they must have something in store for us.
Wa
Ai
Wa
Wa... wa...
Hey
Hey, isn't it great?
Ha ha ha lt's really great!
Go to hell!
See how you like that!
You, you ...
Damn!
Damn' hit them!
AI ai ai
Hey!
Are you alright?
I am still alive.
I am dying!
Why do they have to hit me so hard?
We are half dead but if someone hit us again we will be totally dead!
Why suddenly beat us up?
We must be targeted by someone!
let's find the detective now!
Hey, hey!
Why stop?
What happened?
That is the detective's car he must be somewhere near!
- Right!
- Detective...
Hey, hey!
Come on come on
Aren't that the guy who beat us up?
- Right!
- That's him!
Follow him.
Thanks' Turkey Gor!
Yung Man Kin is Turkey?
He is the killer who killed me?
Your case haven't been solved but no one plans to investigate because your killer is the detective!
Yung Man Kin!
Siu Dip, calm down!
Siu Dip, are you alright?
Siu Dip, I am alright!
Hey, don't be angry
That's why the detective refuses to let us investigate!
He is Turkey!
The detective is Turkey then who is Pig?
What if we know who Pig is?
We can't prove that they are the killers.
What now then?
What?
Yung Man Kin?
Hey!
Why would Yung Man Kin call you?
Hello' yes' what?
Alright... bye.
What?
Why would Yung Man Kin call you?
Hey!
Has he discovered that we know who Turkey is?
He said he found Turkey and asked us to identity him in Sriracha.
Wait' he is Turkey why is there another Turkey?
Isn't that obvious?
He found someone to take the blame!
Then now what?
We will fail no matter what we do!
Sigh I think there is only one person who can help us now.
You are not talking about the private investigator Yip Chi Yuen are you?
That guy is so strange!
Thats what i call a master sleuth.
Yes!
He is not a master sleuth but a crazy sleuth!
Master or crazy he is our last chance, we must risk it!
Let me go too!
No!
Why not I need to catch Yung Man Kin myself!
That is why I can't let you go!
You think I will go crazy and kill him?
I can tell from your silence!
It is for your own good!
We will talk about it when we get back!
Hey, Man!
Have you called the master sleuth here?
He told us to come first, he will call us when he arrives!
Hey, why did Yung Man Kin tell us to come here?
There's not even a ghost here!
Hey!
Don't talk about ghosts you are scaring me!
Hey!
What are you doing!
Wa... wa... wa...
What are you doing!
What is this place
Wa... wa... wa...
Be calm' be calm ...
Ah!
Wa... wa... wa...
Where have you been?
I have stayed here.
You are lying!
We saw you in Sriracha!
Yes!
And we saw you killing Yung Man Kin!
He's dead?
Good!
That bastard, I wish he can die ten more times!
You are actually behind the whole thing!
You made that phone call and lured us to Sriracha!
You also used me to lure Goat and Turkey so that you can kill them' am I right?
What does it matter?
Now he is dead!
Are you happy now?
Have you killed anyone?
Tell us!
I have already told you!
He told me to stay!
How can I kill someone?
You think I will still believe you?
So you have never trusted me!
Yes
Alright, let me tell you if I could I would kill them all!
You are packing your things?
There are still lots of places to see here in Malaysia!
No thanks, there's nowhere else I want to go.
Oh' so do you distrust me or distrust Xiaodie?
Have I frightened you?
No' Bao Gung how do you know about Siu Dip?
I am the landlord' I know everything!
Let me ask you although Siu Dip is a ghost' do you think a ghost can more lovelier than a human?
I don't know!
Ask yourself!
I don't know
Actually although ghosts are scary' humans can be scarier!
Do you know why?
It is very hard to trust a human let alone a ghost!
If you want to leave I won't stop you but don't lose hope after one accident!
Don't lose trust because of 1 bad incident I tell you what is in front of you might not be real!
I tell you what is in front of you might not be real!
Why don't you trust me?
I told you I have nothing to do with him!
So you have never trusted me!
Yes!
When you see this photo you might
I start receiving awards when I was seventeen!
A foreign guy gave this to me!
Yip Chi Yuen Private Investigations
Pig!
Bao Gung!
Oh' where have you been?

What a surprise.
Bei Tai ' Bei Dai ' Ah Ngau!
Hey, what?
What happened?
What?
Yip Chi Yuen is Pig!
What?
The master sleuth?
Yes' and that's not it!
I think Goat and Turkey are both killed by Pig!
What?
Then we have accused Siu Dip wrongly!
I saw him killed Bao Gung just now!
What!
Why don't you tell us sooner?
Lung Poh' what happened?
A very strong sense of killing is coming towards this place!
The sense of death is strong here!
I have heard that there is a ghost in this house who is harming people.
She has already killed two people!
Every since the owner of this house died in a horrible accident this place has became a gathering place for ghosts!
Let me cleanse this place today for the common good!
Yip Chi Yuen' what do you want?
Grand master' let me handle this let me try to reform them!
Alright!
Then I will deal with them !
You have already killed Goat and Turkey why can't you leave Siu Dip alone?
No!
Not only Siu Dip I won't let you go too!
He has a gun!
You want to escape?
Damn this monk is very powerful I am no match for him !
Lung Poh' why don't you leave with me?
If I leave and he comes out where can he find me?
Abomination!
You have hurt humans too many times!
I am not forgiving you today!
Damn you stupid monk!
You can't differentiate good ghosts from bad you are the one who is hurting everyone!
Damn you stupid monk!
I will let you know how good I am when I was young!
I will accept your challenge!
Ah damn
Ah .
Ai
Why do you have to head to certain death!
Ah ... wait!
Wait!
I am a disabled person!
I am a disabled person!
I am a mute!
I am a mute...
Yes yes we are half dead!
Yes' yes!
Hey actually this has nothing to do with us!
Haha yes
We should leave since it has nothing to do with us!
Wait what
What!
A gun!
We are all fucked!
If you haven't found me to look for the killer of Siu Dip I would never have to kill again!
Wu... wu...
30 years!
After 30 years everything should have ended!
I should have the chance to be a better person!
I have killed both Goat and Turkey!
I know that Siu Dip's ghost has come back I use this to lure them out and kill them!
Then nobody will know my secret!
That's why you all need to die!
No!
Man is in danger!
Save him!
I can hold on here!
What can you do if I leave?
Just go!
There's no where to hide!
Come out to die!
Otherwise your death will be much more painful!
Hey, I have watched the movies his gun has 1 6 bullets!
He already fired 1 4' so he only got 2 left!
So you want us to rush out out to risk his 2 bullets?
What if you counted wrong?
then we would be shot for nothing!
I am not wrong!
It's important to save him now!
Hey we are here!
Bei Tai ' Bei Dai '
Where do you think you are going?
I won't let you die so easily!
Ah
Ah Ngau ' are you alright?
Hey!
This bullet is for you!
Yip Chi Yuen!
Hey

Let's see where you can go this time!
Ya
Hey ya

You think I will come unprepared?
Ha
Hey

Don't promise him , Siu Dip!
Don't!
If you can let him go I will leave the world immediately and forget about everything!
Alright!
Siu Dip, Siu Dip!
Siu Dip
Siu Dip Ai!
Man' maybe we can meet again in our next life...
Siu Dip!
Why did this happen?
She finally agrees to leave the world.
Siu Dip refused to leave because she wants revenge!
Now she can give it all up because of Man do you still think she is a bad ghost?
On the other hand no matter how powerful you are you still cannot see through a human heart!
Are you afraid?
If you want to give it all up, follow me!
You are wrapped in red rope so you can never return to this world!
You two will be meeting Siu Dip soon!
Bastard
Haven't you said that you are letting us go?
You are so naive!
Hey!
I was afraid that the ghost will refuse to leave and tell everyone about what happened to her!
Now that she is gone after you are dead no one will know my secret!
That's life you have no choice!
You can't be a good person even if you wanted to!
Put down the weapon to redeem yourself!
Hey ya
Ah ... help'help!
Whatnow?
Ah .
.Yip
Chi Yuen you heartless bastard!
I will come find you even after I became a ghost!
When I killed Goat and Turkey l wrap them with red rope just like you now!
That's means you can never return to this world and find me!
Yes it's a bit hot it is going to end soon!
Hey!
Help!
Hey don't go help!
What can we do now?
Man' help me... ahhh!
Help me... helpme

He is 5 feet 1 0 inches tall' of medium build.
It is believed that he is involved lin the murder of two people in Sriracha of one Malayan Chinese and Police detective Weng Yung Man Kin .
Siu Dip has finally left the world and Ah Ngau will handle the rest of the things.
My trip has finally ended.
I have not believed Hiu Wa and Siu Dip in the end they both died for me!
And because of this I realized that for both human and ghosts trust is a very important thing!
I can finally be myself!
Mister' mister can you buy a fund-raising stamp from me?
Ah!

A vase has dropped down!
So!
Are you dead yet?
How can I die and leave you behind?

No actors appear in this film, just men, women and children who love the Seine.
Who's there, always there in the city and yet always coming and always going?
"It's a river," answers a child that unriddles riddles.
And then with sparkling eyes, he adds...
"And the river is called the Seine while the city is called Paris."
The Seine is like a person sometimes she runs and rushes past hurrying her step when evening falls.
Sometimes in spring she pulls up short and gazes at you like a mirror.
And if you cry she cries or smiles to cheer you up and always breaks into laughter when the summer sun appears.
"The Seine," says a labourer, a man of sorrows, of dreams of muscles and sweat.
"The Seine is a factory the Seine is work."
Up and downstream always the same turning handle fortunes in wine, coal and wheat which rise and fall with the river according to the tide of the market.
Fortunes in bottles and broken glass, treasure troves of rusted scrap of old bedsteads abandoned, reclaimed.
The Seine is a factory.
Even when the weather's fresh, it's always work.
The Seine, she's a song from the headsprings.
"She has the voice of youth", says a woman in love, smiling a woman in love from the Vert Galant.
A woman from the ÎIe des Cygnes, telling herself the same in her dreams.
"The Seine I know her as if I'd made her myself," says a tug boat pilot in a stained boiler suit streaked with oil and sun and smoke.
Risky, dangerous, tumultuous and dreamy all at once.
That's the way she is malice, caress, romance, tenderness, ...caprice, bitchiness, idleness.
If you must know, that's her real pedigree.
"The Seine is a river like any other," says a disenchanted voice of a correct and blasé man one of the first passengers of the latest sterilized tourist boats.
A river with bridges, docks and quays a river with eddies from sewers and sometimes a drowned man, if it is not a dead dog.
With anglers who never catch a thing.
A river like any other, and I'll be the first to lament her.
And the Seine hears laughter and slips away like a cat.
A river like any other any other any other.
A waterway like any other waterway.
Water from glaciers and torrents and underground lakes and melted snow and vanished clouds.
A river like the Durance or the Guadalquivir or the Amazon or Moselle, the Rhine, the Thames or the Nile.
A river like the River Love like the River Love, sings the broadening Seine and at night the Milky Way accompanies its tender golden murmur and also the railway with its usual muffled din.
"A river like the River Love...
"Do you hear the beauty, the cooing?" says a lord of the barges, a summer visitor on the Rapee quay.
The River Love you speak as if I'm indifferent.
It isn't a river, the Seine it's love in person.
It's my river.
My little daybreak, my little trip round the world my life's holidays.
The Louvre, Tuileries, Eiffel and Pointue Towers and Notre Dame, Obelisk, Gare de Lyon, Austerlitz they are my châteaux of the Loire.
The Seine, it's my Rivièra and me, I'm its true tourist and when it runs cold and naked, howling complaints against strangers you have to be short on memory to call it distress, misery or despair but fairy tales and nightmares should not be confused.
And then when below the Pont Neuf the dying day's wind blows out my candle when I withdraw from the business of life when I'm finally at ease in the grand palace of those at rest at Bagneux at Père Lachaise, I shall smile and say to myself:
There once was the Seine once there once was love there once was misfortune and another time forgetfulness.
There once was the Seine and once there was life.
The End
Subtitles:
Verbatim Yucatan, 23.976 fps.
For every action...
There is an equal, and opposite, reaction.
North Pole
EL MONSTRUO ALADO
Radar, designed to defend us against attack.
Radar stations on Mountain tops...
In deserts, deep in untracked forests.
In a thousand, secret and isolated places.
Over both oceans there are radar equipped picket planes.
In both oceans, manmade radar islands to guard our flanks.
There are the inshore pickets, and several hundred miles beyond them are the off shore pickets.
Another radar fence stretches across the long unfortified border between the United States and Canada.
A pine tree radar fence.
And beyond that...
Still another network of electronic eyes.
The Mid Canada Radar Fence.
Even farther north, in the very shadow of the North pole this fence... the Distant Early Warning System known as the DEW line.
Ready to transmit the first warning signal of a sneak attack across the polar region.
To build the DEW line an armada of ships was assembled in the largest, and most secretly planned operation since the Normandy Invasion.
Grinding through treacherous polar ice fields in a desperate gamble against time and weather
To land a mountain of supplies, machines, tractors, and men upon the ice.
First things first, level landing strips for heavy cargo planes,
then shelters for the men, for the planes, and for operations.
... and while some hands are busying laying long pipelines to transport fuel, others build tanks to store it.
The work continues, day and night, around the clock, 7 days a week.
At long last, the ships are gone, the summer is gone, but the job is finished.
Red Eagle One, centennial of the Arctic, nerve center of the DEW line, is operational.
Colonel Parkman arriving, dispatch jeep.
Colonel Parkman?
Glad to have you with us.
Across the roof of the continent still farther north, an outpost of the DEW line.
Hey Mike, Hey Mike, get a look at this.
I don't see anything.
Hey wait a minute...
Listen!
It's almost on top of us!
This is Kane, picket 7327 calling Red Eagle One come in Red Eagle One.
This is Kane, picket 7327 calling Red Eagle One...
Come in Red Eagle One.
Hello 7327 this is Red Eagle One, I read you, over.
Put the old man on the horn would you Pete?
... right, roger.
I've got Lieutenant Kane Sir.
Colonel Parkman, Walter?
What's up!
We're over Weather 4 sir,
The building has been damaged.
Looks like the roof's caved in.
If there's anyone inside they could be hurt, or worse.
I tried to contact them, but there was no answer, over.
We'll get right on it!
Over and out.
When did Weather 4 report in last?
At uh, zero eight hundred, sir, right on the button.
See if you can contact them again.
alright.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
No answer, sir.
Keep trying.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
Operations, Colonel Parkman here, get my plane ready... (Red Eagle One Calling Weather 4...) ... oh and uh, alert Lt. Pizar.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
Two men don't just vanish!
These did.
I don't get it.
Everything was under control when they checked in at zero eight hundred.
Nothing unusual has been reported since then.
No storms...
It wasn't a gale that wrecked this shack.
The sides are caved out as though something crashed into the roof.
Well, if it was a plane that hit it...
Maybe, there's a very ordinary explanation for what happened.
Maybe the men are on the way back to base right now.
On foot?
They would leave footprints in the snow.
Do you see any?
Take a look here!
What do you got?
I don't know!
A plane?
No plane never made that short a run.
A helicopter?
No, a helicopter couldn't make a burrow like this.
If there is an ordinary explanation of what happened, then...
I wouldn't take any bets.
So, the only recent contact you had with the weather shack was when the helicopter dropped supplies there five days ago?
Yes sir.
You checked Weather 1?
Yes sir.
Weather 4 made contact with them at zero eight one three.
Everything was Jake!
I'm picking up something Colonel, but it doesn't make sense.
I never saw a blip like that before.
It's there, then it's gone!
Hey, there it is again.
What do you make of it.
I'm not taking any chances.
Sound the red alert!
Vector 360 climb to Angels 3, bogey 90 miles.
Red leader to Control.
Nothing here.
Give us a new Vector.
Bogey has disappeared, Return to home plate.
Jerry!
Sugar Fly to Red Eagle One...
Come in Red Eagle One.
Sugar Fly to Red Eagle One.
Come in Red Eagle One.
Hello Sugar Fly, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead.
Red Eagle One, we're over the wreckage of the C47.
They found it Colonel!
Get his position.
Yes sir.
Alert Lieutenant Pizar.
Yes sir.
Colonel!
Looks just like the weather shack.
Yeah.
Where are they?
Where are the bodies?
Easy.
Look out!
What in the world is...
What is it?
I don't know.
Looks like it had been broken off of something.
That point's as sharp as a needle.
I give up.
You got me.
Well where do we go from here?
We'll have to let CONAD worry about that.
This is CONAD.
The Continental Air Defense Command, at Colorado Springs.
The focal point of the super sonic shield that guards the North American Continent.
A shield that could mean the difference between life and death for millions of Americans.
These are Hot phones!
Using them it takes only 15 seconds, to talk to Alaska, 10 seconds to alert Newfoundland,
5 seconds to contact you!
3 seconds to reach the Pentagon Command Post.
General Ford Speaking...
Yes.
I see.
Good, I'll take a plane right out.
The Arctic command has delivered the package.
Good afternoon gentlemen.
I'm General Ford.
Oh No, no, Please, sit down.
Gentlemen...
I realize that the Air Force hasn't given you much time in which to make your tests..
... and a definitive job may have been out of the question in the short time you've had, but the Department of Defense hopes that during these two days of concentrated efforts, you've come to some conclusion about this.
Professor Gunther I believe you are in charge.
All of us are agreed to accept one thing this appendage comes from some living creature.
... but as to what creature, it was once a part of, we we are completely in the dark.
Our mathamist, Dr. Arnold Burton, has been unable to identify this object.
Professor Harvy Pierce is certain from his exploration that the "hook", cannot belong to the neurological system.
Well you seem to know more about what it isn't than what it is.
That is correct, sir.
Gentlemen let's be logical.
Now you tell me that this, "hook" comes from something that's alive.
alright.
But it wasn't a part of the cargo and it wasn't in the plane when it took off, so it must have come aboard, after the crash.
Right?
That sounds logical...
Now what was it that came aboard?
It shouldn't be so difficult.
You know the animal life of the Arctic.
We have asked ourselves that, General.
You're not suggesting that it comes from some creature at present, unknown?
It's a possibility we suggest you investigate, sir.
How?
We recommend that you ask Dr. Nedrick Jackson of the museum of Natural History here in Washington, to look into this.
He's their chief Paleontologist and the countries leading authority on the Ali gasi and Carnivori
You've lost me professor.
He deals with life of past geological periods... as shown by the fossil remains of, plants and animals.
He has been able to re-construct prehistoric creatures with, no more to start with then a hand full of bones.
"Departamento de Paleontología" Dr. Jackson.
Curator.
Hi Marge.
Hi.
What have you got there?
A kid in my junior science group made it.
Even added an extra vertebrae as though it doesn't have enough already.
Here, want to count them?
Listen, if I'm ever to get next months issue of the magazine out we better start working.
I've got a feature.
Life parades through the ages.
Showing the progression of prehistoric creatures from the jelly fish, to the dinosaur, to primitive man.
Sounds alright.
... and I'm going to include the pictures we took on your last field trip.
That's even better.
Oh, excuse me.
Jackson talking.
The Pentagon?
Sure I'll wait.
What do you know maybe they want to call me back in the service.
This is Dr. Jackson.
General Ford?
Yes.
Yes.
I see General.
Of course sir I'll be right over.
Everything alright?
... course.
It isn't every day the Pentagon calls you.
You're very nosy.
Okay be mysterious.
Well if I tell you, you'll keep it a secret?
Hope to die!
They found an old bone up at the North Pole.
The Pentagon wants to know, to whom it belongs.
It doesn't look like bone.
More like gristle or cartilage.
A structure as large as this would have to serve a very specialized purpose in order to be cartelized.
Have you any idea what it comes from?
No, not the faintest.
If it were bone we could start from that.
What it does tell me however, is that it can't be from an animal.
Because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton.
As a matter of fact the reptile structure is bony and gentlemen, even birds have bony skeletons.
Looks like we're getting nowhere fast.
On the contrary we're making considerable progress.
At least we know what it can't be, which is bound to lead us to what it is.
Well then is there anything that doesn't have a bony skeleton?
Lots of things: worms, snails, insects, shell fish.
Some invertebrates where there skeletons on the outside, well it an outer shell called an exoskeleton which is hard and rigid enough to protect the internal organs.
Insects have thin flexible places within their heads and bodies which allows them freedom of movement.
Then they have folds where the muscles are attached.
It's a possibility.
An Insect?
That's where the process of elimination seems to lead us.
Of course if it is an insect it certainly doesn't tell us what kind it is.
Well find that out partly from what we know, but mostly from what deduce.
Doc you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes.
Sort of.
Professor Gunther, the fluid from the end of the hook...
You had it analyzed?
Well we, did what we could in the time we had.
Of course you didn't know exactly what you were looking for.
Precisely.
Well I'm not too much of an entomologist, but I do seem to remember...
With very few exceptions the blood of insects contains no red corpuscles.
Now that we suspect this hook may have come from an insect...
Would you test the fluid for me and let me know what you get?
Be glad to.
Thanks.
Well General, that's about it.
Professor Gunther will make his test and...
We'll see what we can dream up.
Do you think we'll get somewhere?
We'll do our best.
"POLAR TRAGEDY REVEALED" "Air Force Discloses Mystery Accident and Disappearance
So that's what they wanted to see you about.
Don't you play games with me Ned Jackson.
I'm sorry.
There's an old saying that you can't keep anything from the press and even if I'm only running a museum mag, ... I haven't lost my nose for news.
That is what it's about.
Maybe...
I know it is!
Maybe not!
Well it's a plain at the nose on your face!
Look.
The Pentagon has never consulted you before.
The papers say they have a mystery on their hands.
One and one still make two, so it follows that they must need information in your field.
Oh Ned, give me a break.
You don't know what it would mean if I could run a story about something that took place in this century!
Well I...
They didn't say it was restricted.
You see?
alright it's, it's like the paper says.
There have been crashes and disappearances.
But the real story is, what they found at the last crash.
It's, well it's about 5 feet long.
It's modeled green in color.
Probably broken off the body some place.
What are you talking about.
It's part of something alive.
Something that must incredibly, unbelievably huge.
I think it's from an insect.
An Insect?
Here.
Doesn't look very fearsome reduced in size like that does it?
No, no it doesn't.
It looks like the spur on the leg of a grasshopper or a cricket.
Grasshoppers and crickets aren't meat eaters and at least 5 men have disappeared.
If that is part of an insect...
It's from the biggest creature that ever lived.
Are you sure you are feeling alright?
there were long skid marks in the snow as... as though the thing flew in for a landing.
Jackson talking.
Oh hello Professor Gunther.
You have.
I see sir, thank you.
Well they just finished the blood tests.
There were no red corpuscles.
It's from an Insect.
... and the ant inside this amber is at least 90 million years old.
Now we've been able to learn from pieces of amber like this...
That certain ancient insect forms have continued without variation until today.
That others have changed to meet changing conditions and certain species have vanished completely.
I just can't believe that an insect as large as you suggest ever existed.
Look behind you on the wall professor.
That prehistoric dragonfly measures 2 feet from wing tip to wing tip.
... and like the modern dragonfly, it too was a flesh eater.
alright, it's big, but it's only 2 feet.
Is that the best you can do?
I never suggested I was looking for a dragonfly.
So what are you looking for?
To be honest with you I'm, not exactly sure.
You're a pathologist Professor Gunther.
The field of pathology is limited.
But the paleontologist field is narrow to what we understand.
On the contrary we stretch our understanding to, try and take in the universe.
alright, suppose, just for the sake of argument that we admit such an insect once existed.
How could it be alive today?
Exactly!
Even the recently discovered prehistoric Siberian mammals were dead.
The natives ate the flesh, used the skin for clothing, made tools from the ivory tusks.
But the mammoths were dead.
Are you sure they were dead?
Why?
Everyone knows they were.
Everyone says they were.
Suppose the Siberians hadn't been in such a hurry to slice them up for steaks.
Suppose they were still alive when found in the ice.
Does your learned young friend always go on like this?
alright professor,
You know as well as I do that if a living organism is frozen quickly enough it's theoretically possible to stop the living protoplasm from changing their geometrical pattern.
Which always happens when death occurs.
Theoretically yes.
Is it unreasonable then to ask yourself...
Whether the mammoths might have remained alive all those years, ... and it was the Siberians who killed them before they had a chance to thaw out and breathe again!
You... you believe this?
Well I don't disbelieve it!
And I'll go along with it until someone comes up with a better theory.
Look, five men have vanished.
To die is one thing.
To disappear without a trace suggests... complete destruction!
A flesh eating creature!
But there are scores of insects that live on other insects.
Where do you start?
By thinking of the hook as though it were infinitely smaller.
As though it were part of an insect no larger than those we know today.
Like oh, the grasshopper, the beetle, or the cricket, then ask yourself...
What flesh eating insect of normal size, has such a hook?
Ned, you're making a lot of assumptions.
Every paleontologist does.
Look, you start with a jaw bone, a couple of teeth, you figure whether they come from a flesh or a grass eater and you go from there!
A normal insect, that is a flesh eater.
I've narrowed the field to one!
The diet consist mostly of small insects such as leafhoppers, grasshoppers, caterpillars and others.
A substantial part of the diet may also include small frogs and lizards.
The female is larger than the male and invariably destroys her mate when he's fulfilled his function in life.
Now the hook they found on the plane may very well be a spur from one of its forelegs.
If this is it, as large as a monstrous creature we looking for I doubt whether anything that ever lived could be as deadly.
It's strong beyond anything it's size suggests.
It walks, leaps, and flies.
It's appetite is insatiable.
You mean, this cute little bug?
Yeah, that cute little bug.
In all the kingdom of the living there is no more deadly or voracious creature.
... than the Preying Mantis.
GREENLAND ESKIMOS TERRORIZED
Anything new on the disaster, General?
Nothing else gentlemen.
Hey, uh, you're Dr. Jackson of the Museum of Natural History, aren't you?
That's right.
Well what have you been called in for?
Dr. Jackson is an old friend of mine.
That's not answering his question, General.
You're a Paleontologist isn't this out of your line?
Have you any theories Dr. Jackson?
Gentlemen, if you were in my position and what you had was a theory, not facts, just a theory,
I'm sure you'd withhold it to avoid any speculation that might prove disastrous.
I'm sure you realize this and that you'll co-operate with us to avoid panic, or hysteria.
I know I can count on all of you.
Well, Good luck to you Ned.
Thanks, I'll do my best.
Hi!
Almost ready?
If can close this.
I'm told the Air Force doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Oh I'm coming.
Here, make yourself useful.
Nice of you to see me off.
I think so.
You know, the Arctic is about the only place where I haven't worked in.
Are those mine too?
No Doctor, they're mine.
Oh...
Yours?
Well you couldn't go alone without your photographer, could you?
My what?
Well I phoned General Ford's office and requested permission for you to take your photographer along.
I guess he forgot to tell you.
Boy this is really going to be a story.
You'll do almost anything for a story wouldn't you?
Almost.
Well come on!
Colonel.
Colonel, sir.
Uh, Dr. Jackson is here from ah, Washington.
He's got a...
I mean there's a, there's a...
We...
Well speak up!
He's with a woman.
A female woman.
I thought they'd stopped making them.
Then show them in.
Yes sir.
I'm Ned Jackson Colonel, I'm sure that Washington...
Excuse me, this is Miss Marjorie Blain;
Colonel Joe Parkman.
El General Ford sent me up.
I'm magazine editor for the Museum of Natural History.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, that will be all men.
It looks like you don't have too many women up here Colonel.
Ah we have a little joke up here...
The boys say there's a girl behind every tree.
Only try and find a tree.
Well when do we see what we came for.
I'll have a plane any time you're ready.
I'm ready.
Fine.
These are the skid marks.
At least what's left of them.
We found the same marks at the weather shack, and the Eskimo village.
Here Colonel.
Got it?
Eight and a half feet.
Let's get back to the plane.
At ease.
Gentlemen, this is Marjorie Blaine.
I thought you wouldn't mind too much if she had a look around your recreation room.
Aw she's like a butterfly.
Light and crosses absolutely boss.
Yes Corporal?
Well, ah, with your permission sir...
Would it be alright if...
would it be alright if I asked Miss Blaine to dance, sir?
Corporal that decision is entirely up to Miss Blaine.
Yes sir.
Miss Blaine would you care to...
Well, what I mean is... while I'm not yes Corporal I'd love to.
Oh hi.
Hi.
Hi Ned.
Thought you were going to join us.
Ah I've been busy.
You two run along, have fun.
What are you up to?
I'm trying to find out how big this thing is.
You know, people used to think that carnivorous plants were the funk.
Actually there are about 450 species of them.
Some are almost 6 feet tall.
I'm convinced that we're dealing with a Mantis and whose geological world the smallest insects were as large as man.
And, the failing to find those insects for its food, it's...
Well it's, doing the best it can.
If there is such a thing why hasn't anybody seen it?
Well those who have are dead!
Ah, who can be sure?
It may have been locked in a prison of ice millions of years ago.
Well what could have released it after all that time?
Oh, any sort of unusual vibration,
You know how, mountain climbers are afraid of thunder?
Well, it's because the sound of the vibration may start an avalanche.
Hit the alert button!
Yes sir!
Operations!
Colonel Parkman speaking...
Condition Red!
Scramble all aircraft immediately!
Condition Red!
Coffee Colonel?
Nine hours and not a whisper.
Which is alright with me.
Red Eagle One, this is Otter 4
Hello Otter 4, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead.
We have nothing here.
Request permission to return to base.
Over.
Request denied, continue search procedure.
Over and out.
The only thing to do is to keep the patrols out straight around the clock until we're sure.
And remember I want a report on anything from Mid Canada, or Pine tree.
Anything.
You understand?
Yes sir.
Got the Mid Canada Radar Fence on the line sir.
This is Colonel Parkman.
Oh Colonel, Blue Captain Hawkins, here.
This is just a stab in the dark but you chaps asked us to report anything unusual and... yes...
As I said, it may not mean a thing, but we caught an unidentified object in our scope.
Could have been a storm or a weather balloon.
It was a faint signal that came a West.
But it might be that oversized bug of yours?
What time was it?
Early.
Zero four hundred I suspect.
Thanks Hawkins.
Thanks very much.
Zero four hundred, that's almost six hours after he left here.
Now it's 1500 miles to the Mid Canada line.
Oh that's no good he'd have to be doing better than 200 miles an hour.
Why not Joe?
We're dealing with an insect.
The deer fly does 600 an hour!
Well that's almost as fast as a jet!
The Mid Canada line is 1500 miles South of here, right?
Right.
And, where was that Weather shack 4?
Right there, straight on the eightieth meridian.
And the, and the C47 crash was here.
That's right, due South of the Weather shack.
What are you getting at Ned?
And the Eskimo village?
Right there, between us and the C47.
Hey wait a minute.
He's been going straight South!
And he'll keep going South till he reaches the tropics where he'll find the same kind of climate and jungle vegetation from which he came originally.
Now let's see he'll probably pass over Labrador, Nova Scotia, then he'll hit the Gulf Stream.
And I'm sure the warm air above the Gulf Stream will attract him and he'll follow it all the way down to South America.
I've got CONAD on the hot line Colonel.
They say it's important.
Thanks.
This is Colonel Parkman.
Are you sure?
Thanks.
Pine Tree got it too.
It went through Newfoundland.
Well it looks like we're on our way to Washington.
Come on Marge.
Grab your toothbrush.
"MANTIS REPORTED AT BANGOR" "AIR FORCE ALERTED!"
"CURFEW ORDERED IN NEW ORLEANS!" "Fear of Mantis Mounting"
"CONGRESSMAN CALLS MANTIS HOAX" "DEMANDS INVESTIGATION"
All over the United States this morning...
Some 400,000 members, of the civilian ground observer corp are gathered to learn more about this fantastic creature.
This program is being presented by the Continental Air Defense Command.
Our first speaker is Major General Mark Ford.
- General Ford.
Thank you.
I want to say at the outset...
That contrary to rumor, and certain newspaper headlines, the so called deadly Mantis is no imaginary scare.
It's a very real and, present danger.
With me this morning is Colonel Parkman.
Commanding officer of an advanced radar interceptor base deep in the Arctic Circle.
Colonel Parkman.
Thank you sir.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
I saw this creature attack our base.
I visited the weather shack, and I also inspected the wreckage of the aircraft that this thing destroyed.
Now we have every reason to believe that the Mantis is flying South...
Along the Gulf Stream.
And we believe that it will be one you devoted men and women of the Civilian Ground Observer Corp who will spot it next time it appears.
I have with me today Dr. Nedrick Jackson...
Curator of the department of Paleontology at the Museum of Natural History.
Dr. Jackson has something important to show you.
Doctor.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
This object, is a spur broken off the fore leg of the Mantis when it destroyed the C47.
Now the spur of a normal size Mantis is so small it's difficult to measure.
This spur, as you can see, is nearly 5 feet long which will give you some idea as to the creature's size.
Thank you, doctor.
Now you ground observers are well trained in the identification of aircraft.
Here, to scale, is the deadly Mantis, and here, is the C47, which it destroyed.
One other thing.
You spotters should listen for a loud droning sound, much like that of a squadron of heavy bombers flying in formation.
Now the Coast Guard and the Navy have been alerted and are standing by...
On the Eastern seaboard.
If the Mantis is sited the procedure will be the same as though an enemy aircraft had been spotted.
Take no chances.
Report any unusual flying objects.
Thank you.
Target is down!
Target is down!
Cannot confirm kill, due to low overcast.
Returning to Carrier.
Out.
Well, here comes another one.
Granary fire in Minneapolis.
Minneapolis not a stir.
There's some power lines down near Richmond.
Richmond Virginia?
Yeah.
There's some birds flying in Fresno.
Fresno, Fresno...
Oh, I'm so tired.
Where is Fresno?
California?
Fresno, California.
Hi.
Hi Marge.
Hello.
Ned.
Hey, what are you up to?
Well, it's kind of a private deal.
We call it operation Marge because she dreamed it up.
Oh?
We're charting every unusual occurrence in the country.
Some may have been caused by the Mantis.
This might give us a clue.
Any luck?
Well they're too scattered to mean anything yet.
You kids know what time it is.
It's after midnight.
Now you're dismissed, both of you....
But General I have the...
No "buts" about it.
You heard what the General said.
Your going straight home young lady.
And I'm the guy whose taking you.
Night Ned.
Goodnight Marge.
Weinterruptthisprogram to bring you a news flash
Atrainwreckhas beenreportednorth of Laurel, Maryland, on U.S. highway one.
TheEngineand5cars were overturned in what appears to have been a freak accident.
Wewillbringyou furtherdetails as they come in.
It's only a few miles from here.
We'll have a look.
Sorry Colonel, been a train wreck.
You'll have to back to Warrington road.
Take the detour to your left, to Laurel.
Pretty bad?
Could have been a lot worse.
How'd it happen?
Probably couldn't see the warning in the fog.
Can't tell for sure.
The Engineer is still unconscious.
Joe do you think it might...
No.
It's just an accident.
Come on.
Let's go.
Gracias.
The light just turned green.
It's too dangerous to drive in fog like this.
Remember what happened to that train back there.
M-m-m, this is more dangerous.
We better get going.
Oh, you forgot your package lady!
thank you driver.
You know, it's good to get home safely with all these strange things going on around here.
Oh there's nothing to worry about 'mam.
You just be careful out in that fog.
thank you.
It'stheverylatestreport!

Take it easy!
How about a couple of blankets up here.
What happened?
Haven't got any idea Colonel.
Something must have lifted the bus and smashed it.
The front end's okay so we know it didn't run into anything.
You boys might just as well go back.
There aren't any bodies!
Oh say, take care of this lady for me, will you please.
Attention, all military and civil defense personnel.
Attention, all police and fire department personnel.
The Mantis has been sighted over Washington!
I repeat.
The Mantis has been sited over Washington.

Give me pigeons to home plate.
Hey Clark!
They said on television that the flyer who shot him down is going in the tunnel after him.
Did you see it crawl into the tunnel?
Hey bud!
Hey, hey bud!
Bud!
Hey!
Hey bud, is it still in the tunnel?
It ain't out here Mac!
Anybody killed?
I only know what I read in the papers!
Hey smart guy, I thought I told you to stay out of that road, now come on get back there!
" I'm going home and watch it on TV." Why go ahead home and watch it on TV.
Alright, don't push!
" I'll push..." I see anything anyway
Yeah, tell it to your neighbor will ya!
That's all the smoke we need.
Shut it off!
How much longer do you think it'll take?
Well we got about a 90 percent saturation of smoke in the tunnel now!
I don't think we can do any better, General.
We'll be lucky if we can hold what we've got.
Those wet tarpaulins will hold the smoke alright.
Just keep pumping!
Everything's under control on the Jersey side sir.
what about the smoke?
It's packed in solid the tarp's holding it fine.
Did you go inside?
Yes sir, but we didn't get too close.
How far in do you estimate it to be?
Oh I'd ah, I'd say, about a quarter of a mile from this end.
That puts the Mantis below the water line.
I don't think we ought to wait much longer, sir.
What do you think Ned?
It's no question in my mind that he's mortally wounded.
If we can keep him in that tunnel he'll die!
Is there anything between us and the Mantis on this end?
17 cars, according to the automatic counter.
If he breaks through those tunnel walls we'll have a flood on our hands.
What do you say, General?
Go ahead, Joe.
Good luck Joe.
Alright men.
You've all been told what to do.
Now the purpose of that smoke in there is to give us cover.
Use it!
Now which of you men is carrying the chemical mines?
Stay up front with me!
And remember, those 3-R-G mines are effective only in a limited area.
So watch for my signal before you throw them.
Alright men, Take Masks!
Let's go!
There's your cover for next months magazine, Marge.
Well go on, take your picture.
Would you mind telling me what's so funny Colonel?
Who me?
Well nothing at all.
Can I help you with the Camera?
No thanks.
Exactly where did you crash into him, Joe?
Well, just about center of the right hand side.
If you follow me, I'll show you.
There.
I think you can see right there, sir.
It's at the uh, base of the neck.
Ned what do you call...
Look out Marge!
I thought you said you killed him?
Don't blame Joe, that was an auto-reflex mechanism, it's dead alright.
Here, put me down.
I said, put me down!
What's the matter?
Don't you like it up here?
I've got pictures to take!
Well, that can wait.
This is no place for romance Joe Parkman.
What about my pictures?
Let Ned do it.
ha, ha, ha, ha....

Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.

You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?

Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.

Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
(?
Lively jig)
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
?
I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
?
So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
?
And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
?
But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
?
That you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
?
Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad?
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
(Groaning)
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
(Woman screams)
(Groaning)
(Stops playing)
(Shouting)
(Screaming)
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
(Woman screeches)
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
(Train rattling)
(Train whistle)
(Knocking)
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
(Verna) Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
(Train whistle)
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
(Clunking)
(Train whistle)
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
(Train chugging)
(Train whistle)
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
(Discordant notes)
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
(?
Folk tune)
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
?
Follow the river
?
The river knows the way
?
Hearts can go astray
?
It happens every day
?
Follow the river
?
Wherever you may be
?
Follow the river back to me?
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
(Train whistle)
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
(Clanking)
(Horse whinnies)
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
(Laughs) It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
?
So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
?
And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
?
Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
?
And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
?
You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack?
(Train whistle)
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
(Man) Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
(Laughs)
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
(Concho) Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
(Laughs) Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
(Train whistle)
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
(Train whistle)
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
(Clicking)
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
(Clamouring)
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
(Man) Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
(Horse whinnies)
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
(Charlie) Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
(Charlie yelps)
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- (Whitey) How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- (Whitey) So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- (Whitey) Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
(Laughs)
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
(?
You Can't Get Far Without A Railroad)
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
There are tracks across the prairie
?
Where the buzzard builds his nest
?
There are tracks across the Rockies
?
To the Golden West?
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- ?
You can't get far without a railroad?
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
(Verna) Grant!
(Whitey) McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- (Man) What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
(Clicks)
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
(Train whistle)
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.

I'd better get back to work..
Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
'Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr. Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
IwasfarminginMissouri I was getting tired of that
SoI boughtmyselfasatchel and a stovepipe hat
AndI headedforthe station gonna travel all about
Buttherewasn'tany station and I soon found out

Youcan'tgetfar withoutarailroad
Youcan'tgetfar withoutarailroad

Oh,youcan'tget far withoutarailroad
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs. Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr. Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelet like only Pete can make an omelet.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelet for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
Two omelets a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelet coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelet?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favored stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What color horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr. Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Traveling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little on the light side for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.

Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy traveling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
SoI boughtmyselfashovel and I bought myself a pick

We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr. Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr. Shannon!
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
- Mr. Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
We're beat, Mr. Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognize all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- (Whitey) Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
Oh,youcan'tget far withoutarailroad
Youcan'tgetfar withoutarailroad
Yougottahaveanengine and you gotta have a track
Oh,youcan'tget far withoutarailroad
Therearetracksacrosstheprairie
Wherethebuzzardbuildshisnest
TherearetracksacrosstheRockies
TotheGoldenWest
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbors
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
Oh,youcan'tget far withoutarailroad
- You can't get far without a railroad
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favorite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What?
I'll take care of my brother.
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.

(Man) I'd better get back to work.
Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
(?
Folk tune)
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
(?
Lively jig)
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
?
I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
?
So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
?
And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
?
But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
?
That you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
?
Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad?
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
(Groaning)
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
(Woman screams)
(Groaning)
(Stops playing)
(Shouting)
(Screaming)
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
(Woman screeches)
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
(Train rattling)
(Train whistle)
(Knocking)
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
(Verna) Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
(Train whistle)
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
(Clunking)
(Train whistle)
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
(Train chugging)
(Train whistle)
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
(Discordant notes)
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
(?
Folk tune)
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
?
Follow the river
?
The river knows the way
?
Hearts can go astray
?
It happens every day
?
Follow the river
?
Wherever you may be
?
Follow the river back to me?
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
(Train whistle)
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
(Clanking)
(Horse whinnies)
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
(Laughs) It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
?
So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
?
And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
?
Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
?
And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
?
You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack?
(Train whistle)
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
(Man) Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
(Laughs)
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
(Concho) Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
(Laughs) Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
(Train whistle)
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
(Train whistle)
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
(Clicking)
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
(Clamouring)
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
(Man) Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
(Horse whinnies)
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
(Charlie) Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
(Charlie yelps)
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- (Whitey) How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- (Whitey) So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- (Whitey) Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
(Laughs)
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
(?
You Can't Get Far Without A Railroad)
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
There are tracks across the prairie
?
Where the buzzard builds his nest
?
There are tracks across the Rockies
?
To the Golden West?
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- ?
You can't get far without a railroad?
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
(Verna) Grant!
(Whitey) McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- (Man) What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
(Clicks)
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
(Train whistle)
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.
Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
And tell the sky above
Does it matter how full the moon
When you've an empty heart
Follow the river
Wherever you may be
Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Come to me, I pray
# I miss you more each day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# When you've an empty heart
# Bring back the great love
# The love that once we knew
# Make my dreams come true
# The dream I had with you
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
I'd better get back to work.
Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
# I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
# So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
# And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
# But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
# That you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad #
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack #
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right.
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# There are tracks across the prairie
# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies
# To the Golden West #
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- # You can't get far without a railroad #
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# When you've an empty heart
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Come to me, I pray
# I miss you more each day
# Follow the river

(Man) I'd better get back to work.
Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
(# Folk tune)
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
(# Lively jig)
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
# I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
# So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
# And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
# But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
# That you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad #
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
(Groaning)
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
(Woman screams)
(Groaning)
(Stops playing)
(Shouting)
(Screaming)
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
(Woman screeches)
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
(Train rattling)
(Train whistle)
(Knocking)
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
(Verna) Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
(Train whistle)
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
(Clunking)
(Train whistle)
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
(Train chugging)
(Train whistle)
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
(Discordant notes)
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
(# Folk tune)
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
(Train whistle)
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
(Clanking)
(Horse whinnies)
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
(Laughs) It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack #
(Train whistle)
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
(Man) Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
(Laughs)
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
(Concho) Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
(Laughs) Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
(Train whistle)
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
(Train whistle)
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
(Clicking)
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
(Clamouring)
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
(Man) Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
(Horse whinnies)
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
(Charlie) Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
(Charlie yelps)
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- (Whitey) How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- (Whitey) So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- (Whitey) Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
(Laughs)
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
(# You Can't Get Far Without A Railroad)
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# There are tracks across the prairie
# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies
# To the Golden West #
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- # You can't get far without a railroad #
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
(Verna) Grant!
(Whitey) McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- (Man) What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
(Clicks)
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
(Train whistle)
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.

Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their rail road.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the rail road.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your rail road.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a rail road.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!

I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music,
Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the rail road to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
First I was.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the rail road ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine shod cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
I think you're real pretty.
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the rail road, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, son of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the rail road.
I guess a lot of people follow the rail road.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the rail road again?
- if I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the rail road and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda shod on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the rail road.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the rail road again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about rail road payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a rail road.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a rail road if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
Ma'am, is that all?
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What color horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 again yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Traveling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
- Been up here before?
- Pad way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build rail roads how to get through the mountains?
The river.
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
♪ Follow the river ♪
♪ The river knows the way ♪
♪ Heads can go astray ♪
♪ It happens every day ♪
♪ Follow the river ♪
♪ Wherever you may be ♪
♪ Follow the river back to me ♪
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy traveling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!

Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat rail road property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
Get outta there!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them rail road people.
Come on!
Come on!
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the rail road.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Was she pretty?
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart
- I think you're smart
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right.
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
ls there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "Hurry wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
Well, then, why?
Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the rail road, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- So you don't want him in?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the rail road again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any pan of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?

♪ Oh, you can't get far without a rail road ♪

How does it go from there, Lee?

Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
♪ Oh, you can't get far without a rail road ♪
- ♪ You can't get far without a rail road ♪
Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite shod.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the shod way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the rail road!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the rail road.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.

ELIZABETH:
Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
[CHATTERING DOG BARKING]
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
PETER:
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
PETER:
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
JEFF:
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds."
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
PETER:
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
[ENGINE STARTS]
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
[HYENAS YIPPING]
[WHIMPERS]
[YELPS]
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

ELIZABETH:
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
[BABY CRYING]
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
[BABY STOPS CRYING]
[BELL RINGS]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Your word will suffice.
KARANJA:
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
[STICKS BANG]
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
KARANJA:
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
CROWN COUNSEL:
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are."
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
MAN:
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana."
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
[DOG BARKING]
[GASPS]
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
NJOGU:
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
[ENGINE STARTS]
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.

You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.

This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
[SINGING]
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
[SINGING STOPS]
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
NJOGU:
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...

CLERK:
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
NJOGU:
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
LEADER:
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.

Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.

He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
NJOGU:
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
[CAMERA WINDING]
[BABOONS HOWLING GRUNTING]
[HOLLY CHUCKLES]
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
[HORN HONKS]
I wonder what's happened to the porch light.
Probably the fuse again.
I'll have a look at it.
JEFF:
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
KIMANl:
Remember me?
Kimani.
- What do you want?
- I've come home.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[CRASHING WHISTLE BLOWING]
ELIZABETH:
Jeff!
KIMANl:
No.
[MOUTHS] Kimani.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
MEYLl:
Yes, bwana.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Were you in your hut last night?
MEYLl:
Yes.
SUPERINTENDENT:
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
SUPERINTENDENT:
What's your name?
MEYLl:
Meyli.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Who was with you?
MEYLl:
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
MEYLl:
No, bwana.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Next, please.
[GASPS]
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
- Type O.
- Come along, please.
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
DOCTOR:
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
[GRUNTING YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
MAN [OVER PA]:
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
GAME WARDEN:
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
[DOG BARKING]
[SINGING]
Hey, you, listen carefully.
[MATSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
You are surrounded by police.
[CHATTERING]
MATSON: [IN ENGLISH] Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
[GUNFIRE]
[MATSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
[CHILD CRYING]
MATSON:
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
MATSON:
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
[THUD]
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
WAITHAKA:
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
[CROWD SCREAMS]
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
[DOOR KNOCKS]
Who is it?
[DOOR KNOCKS VIOLENTLY]
LITTLE JEFF:
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
[GASPS]
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
[PANTING]
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
MATSON:
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
[CHUCKLES]
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
[LIGHTNING CRASHES THUNDERRUMBLES]
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
HENRY:
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
GAME WARDEN:
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
GAME WARDEN:
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
[GUNSHOTS]
HOLLY:
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
HENRY:
Elizabeth.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
PETER:
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
HENRY:
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
PETER:
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
HOLLY:
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
PETER:
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
[PANTING]
[SLAP BABY CRYING]
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
MATSON:
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
[SCREAMING]
Wait.
Please.
[BABY CRYING]
[KIMANI SCREAMS]
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
[BABY MOANING CRYING]
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
PETER:
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
[BABY CRYING]
[GRUNTING]
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
[YELLS]
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.

Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds."
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are."
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana."
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
- Cigarette?
No.
- Dad?
- No, thanks.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
You'd better see to her luggage.
- Can't I watch too?
- It's indecent.
That's why I want to watch.
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
Would you mind letting us by, please?
I've come to pray.
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
- They make a nice couple, don't they?
- Mm.
She's got good lines for breeding too.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Why didn't you go with him?
- I was afraid.
- Afraid?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
What did you bring?
Hello.
You didn't forget my rifle?
Yes, it's right here.
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
She's afraid.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
I wonder what's happened to the porch light.
Probably the fuse again.
I'll have a look at it.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
KIMANl:
Remember me?
Kimani.
- What do you want?
- I've come home.
Jeff!
KIMANl:
No.
Kimani.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
MEYLl:
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
MEYLl:
Yes.
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
What's your name?
MEYLl:
Meyli.
Who was with you?
MEYLl:
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
MEYLl:
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
- Type O.
- Come along, please.
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.

Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds".
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are".
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana".
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
- Cigarette?
No.
- Dad?
- No, thanks.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
You'd better see to her luggage.
- Can't I watch too?
- It's indecent.
That's why I want to watch.
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
Would you mind letting us by, please?
I've come to pray.
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
- They make a nice couple, don't they?
- Mm.
She's got good lines for breeding too.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Why didn't you go with him?
- I was afraid.
- Afraid?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
What did you bring?
Hello.
You didn't forget my rifle?
Yes, it's right here.
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
She's afraid.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
I wonder what's happened to the porch light.
Probably the fuse again.
I'll have a look at it.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
KIMANl:
Remember me?
Kimani.
- What do you want?
- I've come home.
Jeff!
KIMANl:
No.
Kimani.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
MEYLl:
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
MEYLl:
Yes.
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
What's your name?
MEYLl:
Meyli.
Who was with you?
MEYLl:
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
MEYLl:
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
- Type O.
- Come along, please.
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.
[SINGING]
ELIZABETH:
Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
[CHATTERING DOG BARKING]
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
PETER:
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
PETER:
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
JEFF:
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds".
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
PETER:
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
[ENGINE STARTS]
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
[HYENAS YIPPING]
[WHIMPERS]
[YELPS]
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
ELIZABETH:
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
[BABY CRYING]
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
[BABY STOPS CRYING]
[BELL RINGS]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Your word will suffice.
KARANJA:
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
[STICKS BANG]
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
KARANJA:
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
CROWN COUNSEL:
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are".
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
MAN:
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana".
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
[DOG BARKING]
[GASPS]
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
NJOGU:
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
[ENGINE STARTS]
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
COOK:
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
[SINGING]
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
[SINGING STOPS]
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
NJOGU:
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...

CLERK:
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
NJOGU:
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
LEADER:
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.

Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.

She's got good lines for breeding too.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Why didn't you go with him?
- I was afraid.
- Afraid?
Afraid of what?
WOMAN:
Hello, my darling.
MAN:
Hello, my darling.
LITTLE JEFF:
What did you bring?
PETER:
Hello.
LITTLE JEFF:
You didn't forget my rifle?
WOMAN:
Yes, it's right here.
MATSON:
Henry.
WOMAN:
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
MATSON:
What do you think?
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
She's afraid.
Why?
What of?
[DOOR KNOCKS]
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
HOLLY:
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
NJOGU:
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
[CAMERA WINDING]
[BABOONS HOWLING GRUNTING]
[HOLLY CHUCKLES]
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
[HORN HONKS]
I wonder what's happened to the porch light.
Probably the fuse again.
I'll have a look at it.
JEFF:
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
KIMANl:
Remember me?
Kimani.
- What do you want?
- I've come home.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[CRASHING WHISTLE BLOWING]
ELIZABETH:
Jeff!
KIMANl:
No.
[MOUTHS] Kimani.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
MEYLl:
Yes, bwana.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Were you in your hut last night?
MEYLl:
Yes.
SUPERINTENDENT:
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
SUPERINTENDENT:
What's your name?
MEYLl:
Meyli.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Who was with you?
MEYLl:
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
MEYLl:
No, bwana.
SUPERINTENDENT:
Next, please.
[GASPS]
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
- Type O.
- Come along, please.
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
DOCTOR:
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
[GRUNTING YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
MAN [OVER PA]:
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
GAME WARDEN:
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
[DOG BARKING]
[SINGING]
Hey, you, listen carefully.
[MATSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
You are surrounded by police.
[CHATTERING]
MATSON: [IN ENGLISH] Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
[GUNFIRE]
[MATSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
[CHILD CRYING]
MATSON:
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
MATSON:
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
[THUD]
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
WAITHAKA:
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
[CROWD SCREAMS]
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
[DOOR KNOCKS]
Who is it?
[DOOR KNOCKS VIOLENTLY]
LITTLE JEFF:
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
[GASPS]
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
[PANTING]
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
MATSON:
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
[CHUCKLES]
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
[LIGHTNING CRASHES THUNDERRUMBLES]
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
HENRY:
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
GAME WARDEN:
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
GAME WARDEN:
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
[GUNSHOTS]
HOLLY:
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
HENRY:
Elizabeth.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
PETER:
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
HENRY:
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
PETER:
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
HOLLY:
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
PETER:
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
[PANTING]
[SLAP BABY CRYING]
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
MATSON:
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
[SCREAMING]
Wait.
Please.
[BABY CRYING]
[KIMANI SCREAMS]
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
[BABY MOANING CRYING]
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
PETER:
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
[BABY CRYING]
[GRUNTING]
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
[YELLS]
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.

Pass!
Let's hurry!
Come!
Where is the farce Marcella?
- Marcello fortuneteller?
- Yes.
- You her friend?
- No.
Her brother.
You also guessing on a glass bowl and tea leaves?
If only, I do not believe that any penny.
In any case, things you better than mine.
My name Kvedchi.
- Not all the same call Duran.
By Romani which means "a fig."
Here's how!
Once I was an acrobat - I jumped from 12 meters into the bath.
A one night missed.
Since then - not worth a fig.
Keep.
I mended your pad.
Can you portray Lovelace evening.
I do not work the shoulder muscles more.
But the language works.
Maybe I'm lucky, and you tell me where I can find Marcello?
There.
The second trailer for the circus.
Thank you.
- What is this rogue?
- Bro Marcella.
Go and prosperous branch of the family.
So smartly dressed!
- Too!
Or a policeman or a thug.
But it expressed pretty well.
So bandit.
- Oh, it's you!
- Your joy is encouraging me.
How do I see you has kept the family tradition.
How do you come from?
From prison.
A little rest in 6 months.
Clutter, shorter.
I wonder, when will you grow up and poumneesh?
Change the record, okay?
Give the best drink.
The buffet has a wine.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Fatigue.
Heart...
- No!
It is you not the weakest link.
You know, all of this - the word.
We fight, finding fault, but generally...
We love each other, no?
- Heck!
Here we are!
I need you, yes?
Yes.
I...
I would have to...
I have to hide for a few days.
But do not worry.
Do not the cops.
So much the better.
Because here strictly look after us.
Fair - is a disease of the gendarmes.
No one knows why.
How do you think you can get me a job?
You are not going to tell me that looking for a job?
Well, let's say, that was something to do.
It looks like you're in something cool vljapalsja!
I was in prison.
- Look, Bernard.
- Yes?
I do not play face-down.
I'm ready to be for you, but I need to know against whom?
I have already told you about my former friend - gang Richoni?
- Good buddy!
- I told you, the former!
They cranked a small business.
It is not weak.
We took a big jackpot - 14 million.
Wow!
Give me my pills.
There, in a box.
14 million - is hiding.
You - the shelter that I know.
You stole prey?
When you want to settle down, it takes money.
But do not worry, my friends about anything not guess.
Even the fact that I was known for their cache.
They are there, for sure, not see for several days, and during this time...
During this time?
I do not know, complications may occur, minor disassembly...
Accidents at work...
You sold them ?
!
I sell?
No.
Passed.
Do not you think the same, for the sake of the 14 million I will stand on ceremony?
14 million...
Can you imagine?
They will quickly realize which way the wind blows, if they have a head on their shoulders.
To get the moolah, they killed two agents and three passers-by.
So, believe me, my head on his shoulders at them - only temporarily.
The main thing that I could sit in the shelter,
Until they are caught.
- Money to you?
- Laugh or what?
- How much you give, if I help?
- What do you mean!
Will you take stolen money ?
!
You would divide wrongfully acquired?
Would deprive his brother ?
!
What about your sister?
You'll get as much as do.
Will not work, there is no fuel.
Okay.
Come descend to Cinco.
Let's go.
It is the owner of the circus.
And it is more than one, - he owes me money.
It's okay.
Just hoof ragged.
It is necessary to treat with ointment.
Or maybe to get started is to call the vet?
Vet?
And why not pedicurists?
Do you think I have little parasites on contentment?
Come on, shoo!
Take it from here.
But mother and Marcella.
Again, probably came to knock out money from the owner.
Who is she?
And it is quite personal.
This is your show?
Oh well!
Cinco!
A, Marcella, my beauty!
I'm always happy to see you.
Only you are not on time.
You just do not think I have my bad intentions.
Long for me - is sacred, but...
- I did not come here for this.
Do you still have no barkers?
- Yes.
And soon there will be nothing at all.
Things are deteriorating, people no longer go to the circus...
And you know why?
- Due to the television.
Exactly!
Circus offered to them right at home.
They baldeyut home with his family.
This is for him?
This is my brother, Fernand Bastia.
You do me a favor, if You take it.
It's hungry?
To work for me, you must be hungry.
Then consider that I'm hungry.
Well, if that's the manifestation of humanity - well.
And I know how to be grateful.
Just keep in mind - here you are not a farce.
It is necessary not only to be a greeter.
I must still be helpful.
And much work to do here.
And in response to the generosity of Cinco:
2000 francs per week, and grubs.
2000!
Are you kidding ?
!
You pay the guy the previous 5!
And nearly bankrupt, with such a breadth of US!
Do you want to take it or not.
- I take!
- Listen Cinco, can you...
- He has already agreed!
It you take a piece of bread!
You'll live with the acrobats.
Madeleine!
Take this guy for Dario.
Will live with him!
No, sit down, I'm going.
Well, we'll see you tonight?
Tell me, do you want?
Yes, after the closing.
But it's too late!
I can not walk after 10.
Okay, come when you want.
Something will think.
Oh, unwound, my mother is coming!
Lets go faster!
All the time an eyesore, and all the time with a servant!
All in father!
That did not stop my father to marry...
Society lady!
Gypsy acrobats - it's here.
This small palace!
You must have not often worked in the circus?
- Why?
- So, come to mind.
How long are you going to stay here?
Let's see.
What?
Nothing.
Just like that.
And why did you suddenly decide to come here?
I am looking for work.
So bad luck, you found it.
Way or not?
I am looking for work and found.
What is your name?
- Gina.
And this - my trailer.
Only with flowers.
Since then, as the Cinco cut staff, I live alone.
This has its cons and pros...
.
Dario?
Dario!
- What's the matter?
- Brought you a tenant.
Who else?
This brother Marcella.
Cinco hired him greeter.
Come here!
My name is Philip.
Philip Dario.
You surely have heard about me.
Of course!
Dario and Nellie - "The Ghost and Death"!
There is no more room.
- You did not tell Marcella?
- Yes, of course, I tell!
Okay, I'll leave you.
See you later.
Well, welcome...
Come!
Make yourself at home!
Your predecessor was sleeping on the right side,
If you have a preference or superstition...
No, no!
Take the couch, I will build on the cot.
I'm sorry, I have to go to work with Stella.
Stella - this is my daughter.
I'll explain it later.
Hey, Mom!
Mama!
What do you want?
Go keep an eye on the bench, I'll be right back.
The next...
Well, satisfied with their housing?
Oh, yes!
More than sugary hard to think!
Could get me anywhere else!
Where is it?
The trailer Marcella?
No...
I would have liked more than another.
Here is how?
What?
I do not know.
For example, the one with the flowers.
Beautiful colors, pleasant company and smells good...
For example, waking up in the morning, at breakfast...
- What do you eat breakfast?
- Coffee.
When I as a child - More and croissants.
What are you laughing at?
- You're just like a fair actor!
- Maybe belated vocation?
- Yeah, he can.
A can converge see your trailer?
No.
Not now.
- Gina...
- Gina, please!
- Yes!
- It's because I'm good,
I have to go.
Merchants closed at 7 o'clock.
There will be a bakery, there will be no croissants.
All this chatter!
He must be somewhere!
Good.
We here will not uyd置.
- So what?
- What?
A curtain!
It is nowhere seen.
- So he's hiding somewhere.
Thinly noticed!
I do not whether you think that it will be waiting for us on the terrace of a cafe?
Pour a mug.
- You've got the idea, Fredo?
They I have always, and it is ill-advised.
For ideas - as friends, they should not be too much.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Yes.
A?
What?
Yes.
Yes, I know!
Well, where is she?
Thank you.
You're a real friend!
What?
The name of his sister - Marcella fortune-telling.
Maybe he's hiding from her after the case in a villa in Neuilly?
Where she lives, this abnormal?
Powered by miserable fairs in provincial towns.
- These godforsaken full!
- Fredo!
You will not find a cigarette?
What if he did not go to his Sis?
Now, with attendants, that it may fall down abroad.
Well, call Jojo.
- All sorts of Jojo!
- Jojo, the little wagon!
- What's the matter?
- Police!
You bastard!
He passed us!
Open!
Police!
Yes, all right, go to sleep.
I have played so!
Brigade for the Protection of morality!
O, it happens with them.
Open.
They better not mess with.
- What is it?
- Open, gentlemen!
Ugolovka!
Hands up!
Hands up!
Well, Richoni?
What you say?
This time you got burned.
- Your informant still confused.
- Do not move!
- Oh, Fred!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
No way!
Shoot, guys!
Shoot anything that moves!
Let's go through the yard!
What are you!
They have there just waiting for you!
Bastards!
In the hatch!
Faster!
Surrender!
I give you 2 minutes!
Now you can not rush.
To taste?
- Okay, a splinter of glass.
There is a way out?
- Yes.
What about the others?
As you said, friends should not be too much.
Exactly.
- You're not good?
- Do not worry, everything is fine.
It would be nice.
Let's go!
Here!
Come executed by my 2000 francs!
Ladies and gentlemen, the idea that you'll see, ... This idea.
Great idea!
With celebrities such as...
Madeleine, Gina, Stella and Dario ... and...
And also with the rest of the troupe!
If you think so you can get people to go to...
Just listen, as it should!
Come, ladies and gentlemen!
Come!
Cinco The circus - a circus, not like the others!
No billboards, no ads, no idle talk!
Just an idea!
We could show you 100 rooms!
These we have.
But we will show you only 10, but only with the stars!
Here Freni - Empress nudity!
Artistic art, in other words, educational,
Which you can watch the children.
Lovely Gina - goddess of dance!

The show begins!
This, ladies and gentlemen!
- Hi, Am?
d?
e.
- Hi!
Do you want some coffee?
No.
No, thanks, I already drank.
Listen, you do not have a newspaper?
Bulk!
And you do not have one, but...
today?
No.
I, you know, they just build up the fire, so...
Good morning!
Well, Dad, we do not work this morning?
Works.
But I had to repair the suspension strap.
Hey, yesterday I had no time to introduce you to Stella, my daughter.
We are preparing with a single number.
Number stunning!
- Well, Dad, are we going?
- We are going.
Listen, I want to walk.
You do not have another key?
Why?
What is there to steal?
Yes, of course...
Well, Dario, your tenant already awake?
Half...
Such a strange type.
I do not know what time he arrived yesterday.
Sleeps dressed.
Maybe he a lunatic!
Oh yeah...
View Gina tired.
Perhaps she, too, a lunatic?
You could have knocked!
I'm sorry.
Still, good morning!
What you happy - it's your courtesy, tenderness.
Well, you can not be the same day and at night.
Have to evening dance with the long sleeves.
You guided me bruises.
Do you want to tell you one stupid?
Well, tell me.
I really like you.
You do not have to answer me, in turn,
Maybe it was just a nice night, just for you...
I wanted to tell you...
I mean, if you want...
You would not mind every night dance with long sleeves?
Here!
Go!
Buy a newspaper, and then I'll give you an aperitif.
Welcome!
No, well, you see?
Once he has a grandmother, it can no longer shake hands?
If he had a grandmother, he would not have worked for Cinco.
I know what I'm saying!
I'll be right back.
Teach by heart?
What?
Article about the fight at Pigalle.
3rd time already read.
Well, everything ?
!
Are you at home?
Check the pockets?
We follow the mail?
Would wait until I take a subscription before removing the meter reading!
These are your friends?
- Who?
- Men with Pigalle.
Why are you hiding?
Who are you afraid of?
I perfectly see that you're scared.
- Where are you going?
- Where do I want to.
Imagine, I do not like the slap.
- Liar!
Oh, forgive me!
When I'm on edge, slap yourself frustrated.
Let's forget, okay?
You read that five were killed.
If you do not know them, why do you have such a person?
Because the other two.
Are you saying that you would be staged 7 dead?
You are strongly capable in the long run.
You got me with that thing!
END OF THE GAME
Do not be angry!
Let's go sit down.
I'll treat you.
Waiter!
- Mademoiselle?
- The same.
- Now!
Stubborn around, huh?
Okay, come on.
I'm listening to you.
You got into something bad, Fernand.
That's why you're here.
I do not want to know, you're right or not.
And even if you're wrong, I'm ready to be with you.
Oh!
Love - it is so beautiful.
Why do you say that?
Because you know that those types, which finished off, participated in the robbery of Marseille.
What the police did not find 14 million francs.
So you talk.
And since you are able to run, you divide 14 2.
Yesterday you took me for a bandit,
And you liked it.
Today you take me for a sucker, and you like it even more.
I had a good night, Gina, but...
Than 14 million.
I simply offer you my assistance.
Help to spend it?
- Here, Mademoiselle Gina.
- Write down, I'll pay tomorrow.
See?
Do you believe that everything has already happened.
Wronged?
- Not at all.
You too cunning for me, Fernand.
Talking to himself, and makes me tired.
I was fascinated, but wrong.
It happens.
Goodbye and good luck!
A pack of cigarettes.
Thank you.
Time is right, kids!
Hurry!
- But where is Jean?
- From Bastia, where else?
I feel sorry for Gina, she sunk down on a guy.
What is she in it found in this clown?
I do not understand.
If I were in your place, I would know what to do.
You have returned the money that I have a year must be his sister?
All work!
And with a soul!
And with enthusiasm!
Revenue today should be good!
You know my number with Stella
Ready.
This could save you.
- I know, I know.
- It is necessary to order the posters!
Oh, wait a minute.
Posters fine, but it is not important...
- They can be made in two colors.
- Yes!
For instance, I just thought...
What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- No!
Every time you're talking about one and the same, and I already told you "no!".
Why?
Because you suggest it to all the girls.
But others - this is nonsense, does not mean anything.
You see, I'm honest!
Why would I be honest?
Because I love you.
Yes, you know it.
- When love girl, her respect.
Oh, you're reading too much!
And this is life.
You're the only one I love.
Do you want to be the only one with whom I do not want to sleep?
No, it is illogical to do everything!
Leave me alone!
What if I talk to your dad?
But for now, if he catches you in his trailer, he kicks your ass.
If he agrees, I'll marry you.
At once.
And in the church!
White dress, green plants, red carpet.
And the gatekeeper!
Well, I agree?
- No!
- This is the same train!
- Yes, that's it!
I am too poor, right?
But if that's the case, you will be mine!
Bastia?
Come help me prepare tickets.
You then asked.
- Who?
I do not know.
The man who got out of the black car.
- What did he want?
- To find out whether you're here.
- He did not say anything?
- No.
Only that will see you later.
And... he looked like?
In your style.
The style that we do not like, let it be known.
Thank you!
Thank you very much, that I was warned.
- Where's he gone?
- To hell, I hope!
- Then who will drum up?
- You're, like yesterday.
You're right.
At the same time I will spare 2000 francs.
Even 5000 - I add myself a salary.
All the places for the parade!
Are you going to go?
We do not prevent, I hope?
Pepe feared hurt.
However, Pepe?
Yeah.
Ogonyok not find?
Yes.
- Read newspapers?
- Yes.
You with Pepe lucky.
- So we said, going here:
We lucky!
In our country such a friend like you!
You've always been decent, Fernand.
We walked, and said, "Fernand decent."
We were wrong?
- No...
I was sure that we can count on you!
We Pepe plans to leave, but not enough money.
You know life - without the money does not go far.
But...
I have no money!
That's why we're here.
To tell where to find them.
Or rather, it is to remind you.
I'm sorry, Fred, but I gave up.
The last six months I was stunned.
I decided to change my life.
- Well done!
It is necessary to give up the old life to doing good, huh?
You will have a pleasant memory.
And it will be nice to Pepe.
The money is still in a place that you know.
- I?
- Yes.
Converge zaber群h and come back.
What if I caught?
On Piga, certainly, full of cops.
Do you know them!
I mean...
Do you know how to behave.
And then - you did not participate in Marseilles, so... 14 million for four - This is good, no?
A for the three do not want to?
Yes, it is tempting...
But very risky.
From my pedigree, I can get 10 years.
Understand me, Fredo...
- I understand you perfectly!
Only Pepe will not be happy.
He told me: "If you give up the slack Fernand, I'll kill him!"
Pepe - he was.
But calm down, I'm here!
I have to reason with him.
Well, I'll tell him you agree?
- Yes.
- Grandmas are tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- Good.
For example, at 7 pm.
I'll give you half an hour of reserve.
Then - descends Pepe.
- Everything went well?
- Delicious.
- Well, what did he say?
- And what could he say?
- And you left him?
Go away?
- Yes.
And you'll stay,
Keep an eye on him.
- Trust me.
- If you want to know my opinion...
- I know him.
You do not have to say.
But what did he want?
Money.
But I'd rather die!
Do you hear?
I'd rather die!
- Maybe this is not the way out?
I behaved with you is disgusting.
You could throw me.
You're a good girl, Gina.
I understand it now, because I start to see more clearly.
Because you are satisfied with it.
Imagine that also suits me.
- Yes!
- Do not start.
How was I to guess that you have money?
I loved you with them or not.
It's called loyalty.
- Listen to me, Gina...
Are you kidding over all?
The parade finished, the greeter was me.
Can I now draw a dancer ?
!
Come on, shoo!
This circus does not suit me!
Now
- Mademoiselle Josiane, perfect woman!
When they have to go back?
- Tomorrow at 7.
- There is a time to collect the suitcases.
- Are you ready to quit the circus?
- Anyway, he soon he would leave me.
Where is the money?
- In the suitcase.
- A suitcase?
The cell storage in the North railway station.
We'll leave tomorrow morning.
And if you will follow me?
Decide that you went for the money.
The funny thing is that it's true.
Yes...
Or maybe you prefer that I went for a suitcase?
Yes!
Yes, I prefer!
You see, I trust you.
In this and the good of the family are being built.
And now it's my turn.
This is a farewell waltz.
Lovely Gina, the goddess of dance!
Do babes such a success!
Local public immediately legible.
It is a pity that we have to leave tomorrow.
- Direction
- North Station.
Direction
- Arches.
What do I do in the North Station?
Pick up the suitcase on the receipt, which you stole from me.
Brock!
- What did you call me?
Thy name!
I pulled a receipt storage.
Receipt, which I hid here under the table!
And that you come back to me!
Look, Bastia,
Your pukalki can not force me to give what I did not take.
Do not give you in the face with it, too, will be able to make not.
A and so will happen, if you would not uber群h.
Then I'm glad.
Do not be offended, I was joking.
- Never mind.
But you're wrong, kidding...
Such things.
Yes.
It's like a cigarette butt can start a fire!
Perhaps it would suit the owner.
Yes, but only if he paid the premiums.
Gina!
Come here.
What's the matter?
- My receipt of storage!
- So what?
I pulled it!
- Richoni?
- No, definitely not.
Then who?
We've got no thieves.
What are you talking about ?
!
In addition to the receipt, I stole all the money out of a suitcase.
And so - no thieves!
What a fool!
This morning I took out a shirt out of the suitcase.
And the money was there still.
So it happened recently?
What does it change?
All!
If you hurry, you still catch my thief at Gare du Nord!
Do you have money?
I do not.
Maybe you have Marcella?
You carry nonsense.
Perhaps Cinco?
He told me to pay for a few weeks.
You should in any run.
I'll come to you first train.
Wait for me at the hotel "Piccardi," you know?
- Yes OK.
Fernand!
Yes?
If you return the money, we will go to Italy.
If you deceive me, I shall hand you to the police.
You clear favorite?
You are not as good as I thought, Gina.
Do not "is not so good." Not such a fool.
Okay, go.
If tonight everything goes well,
We will be able to pay taxes, for the light, and we can go tomorrow.
- To pay all the salary?
- If all pay, we will not go away.
I do not need anything Dario, fortunately.
He's an artist.
Madeleine - too.
Dame illusionist a little money, that's all.
And so well.
My poor Royal.
In such circumstances, we hold out long.
If Dario number will be successful, we will be able to get out.
This is our last chance.
- Phantom.
Cinco!
What do you want?
- Money!
- You're on time.
Cinco, I'm serious.
I have to leave.
- With the strikers?
- Yes.
Right now, Gina, I can not.
But in the evening, after the presentation, I will try.
But it's not great - throw us in a moment.
Sorry, Cinco.
I would have stayed, but I can not.
The rats are leaving the ship.
Hey, little girl, let's go have dinner.
Can not find your number 3968.
Perhaps it has already taken.
Yes, but...
You do not know who?
How should I know?
I atonement for service in 8 hours.
What's more, I could not give you your suitcase without a receipt!
And you tell me, as your colleague who works during the day, - where is he?
At home, I guess.
But if you think that he will be able to remember the customer...!
We then give out per day more than one thing, so...
- Hey, please!
- Yes, I'm coming!
Sorry, sir.
- Everything happened?
- Nothing like this.
Marcella must leave.
She needed all of her money.
What kind of selfish!
- But we still be able to leave?
Leave something we can always.
Depends only, under what conditions.
Any day fly off the vultures, hawks...
Hawks?
Bailiffs!
Do you think they will take my horse?
These people take everything.
Straw and logs, stairs and clocks, machinery and horses...
It Attila of our time!
Log in!
What do you want?
Nothing!
I was passing.
Well, Marcella sent you to hell?
- How do you know?
- To eavesdrop.
I'm always eavesdropping.
- Anyway, you're honest.
- I am glad that you found my dignity.
This will facilitate the work.
Cinco!
You are sitting on the rocks.
- Not at all!
Daughter you hard worker.
But you're still sitting on the rocks!
You already said that.
So what?
But if there was a guy, a good guy in all respects,
Which will accumulate?
What can you offer him?
- You know this guy?
- What can you offer him?
- Well... circus.
Number of Stella and Dario is almost ready.
International Class!
You can repeat it without laughing?
Horse Josiane.
Horse Mademoiselle Josiane!
With or without a rider?
- Nahal!
What do you mean?
I mean that is the only guarantee - if I become your kinsfolk.
I want to marry, and you need money.
I'm getting your son in law, and you save a circus.
For the salvation of the circus, my Kvedchi, you need a lot of money.
I have.
- And cash!
- Yes, I have.
And where?
You know, after my accident I embraced you.
I won.
Yes - compensation, disability benefits.
400 thousand!
What do you say to this, father?
Josiane,
You're already an adult girl, almost a woman.
A woman was not created to live alone.
I do not marry Kvedchi!
What you are discussing here is disgusting!
Is that you talking with her father so ?
!
Strange you raised it.
If I knew...
Sidi.
Why do you refuse Kvedchi?
As it has charm.
- Oh, yes!
And this charm he gives everything.
No one skirt missed!
Does it good!
Well, nothing can be done, Kvedchi.
I thought you were serious fellow.
Take your money.
Circus, certainly will not,
But my daughter will be happy.
I am happy with the ruined and robbed her father.
In the living corpse!
Television remove him hide,
Bailiffs will get seeds.
We beg, my girl.
But most importantly, I make you happy.
- Oh, come on, Dad, please!
I agree.
I agree, if Kvedchi promise me that...
Oh, yes!
I swear!
Hide grandmother!
- This is Gina.
- A, you can discover!
- Good evening!
- Good evening.
- Well, okay!
Till tomorrow.
- Till tomorrow.
- You asked to come in the evening.
- What is said is said.
How much do I owe you?
Today is...
34 thousand francs.
Wow!
- Hold.
With a small premium.
Yes, it's a fortune!
In life there are ups and downs.
At the moment - soon rise.
- Borrowed?
- Rodney.
In vain you are leaving us on the rise.
Can I still and will be back.
Thank Cinco.
Gina!
So, is it true?
Are you leaving us?
- Tomorrow I leave.
- With the strikers?
Yes.
Where are you going?
In another place.
It's because of those guys that came?
Cinco you paid?
It's wonderful, it has money - burn!
I know.
This is Marcella.
Once they slept together.
And she always had a weakness for him.
Marcella?
Can not be!
I'm telling you!
Goodnight Kvedchi.
Monsieur!
Monsieur!
- Who's there?
- You are asked to phone.
You call from Provence.
You can pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, yes?
Yes, yes, it's me.
Waiting.
Hello?
It is on the phone.
He got a call from Mersevalya, Marsevalya...
Stay here.
Yes, hello?
Is that you, Gina?
No, no, nothing happened.
I am late.
How is it not scary?
Yes.
And so, you are not thieves!
What?
How to...
Cinco ?
!
A lot of money?
Do you think you can still fix it?
Yes, it is.
Okay, I'm going.
Keep.
So will converge.
Wait, that's not all.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Here.
Up to 9 hours, you call the number 7 in Marsevale.
And leave this message to Mr. Roland.
"Sending will Marsevale this morning."
"Suitcase was not present in the cold."
Rely on me.
- Well, call me a taxi.
Well, mademoiselle.
Now the flowers?
Yes, flowers.
For Josiane.
- So this is serious?
What?
I told you that it will be mine.
She is mine.
Well... almost.
I wonder what made her change her mind?
- My lovely manners.
- Your manners!
What are these two again come to do here?
Do you know them?
Then be engaged in their business!
What do I do!
It comes back, but no money.
- I am surprised that he returns.
- Maybe he likes trouble.
Go.
- I was in a hurry.
- I also.
Nice to hire?
We thought that you're tired, because the car drove.
Fernand!
What?
Send it.
Fernand, be kind.
- If you do not fall behind, I'll scream.
- I shoot.
- If you think I'm scared...
- As if I'm going to shoot you!
- Leave it, Gina, this is a misunderstanding.
- How cute!
Let's hope not the last.
Fredo, you must listen to me!
Of course, Fernand, we are here to do just that.
I do not dare to go for the money.
At the last moment I was afraid that the police monitors the cafe.
You is surely arranged.
As they watched the cafe, they have not followed the North Station.
Fredo, you're wrong!
- You think I'm guilty.
And I - a victim!
- Misunderstandings.
I know.
The only misunderstanding between us - I perceive you as a man.
I wanted to give you a chance.
You look like you could not use it.
- I was robbed of a receipt storage.
- It's impossible.
- I swear his eyes, Fredo!
- Look, Fernand,
You have passed the cops.
It is still possible to settle.
We all forget.
But the favor.
The money we need.
- But I'm telling you...
- And we'll get them.
Even if you have to pull out of the bills one by one.
But this - work for Pepe.
I'm telling you, I stole it!
I stuck it under the table.
We have a lot of time, Fernand.
Maybe you want to work Pepe?
I'm telling you I do not know anything!
- You're stubborn!
- Yes.
Everything is ready.
Are you comfortable?
Yes?
Good feeling?
Where is the money?
I would, perhaps, have learned if you trusted me.
Listen, give me time, I'll find a jug.
What are you risking?
It Again we throw!
I assure you, he can!
- Fuck you!
Pepe!
Calmly.
You should not tease him.
Where is the money?
Hell, Fred, if I knew, why would I come back?
In order for us to kill you!
I do it?
- While Turn to the machine.
Turn around.
We're going back to the circus.
It blockhead!
You can only help me!
I now know the circus.
Take me back,
And I swear I will settle everything quickly.
What do you think?
I think that you are too diligent.
Forget the circus, I will do everything for you.
Especially not flutter.
I just I will go and have a look and come back immediately.
Admit it, it would be a shame to die so young, with hoarded money?
- You leave Pepe?
Recklessly!
- Recklessly would leave him.
- I?
- Today you will work in a new way.
- You think so?
- Language, for a change.
- Do you have a candle?
- Yes.
How old are you?
Packaging.
And the matches.
No, the big boxes.
Please, sir.
With you 290 francs, monsieur.
Gina!
Gina!
So you did not go?
- As you see.
So you stay with us?
- Maybe...
- I am very happy.
Listen,
I go from Arsha.
Everything is settled, we're leaving tonight.
- Give me your jeep.
- You crazy?
- Give me your jeep!
- What does all this mean ?
!
Listen Cinco, all very serious!
A petrol - is also seriously?
I'll pay.
And be careful!
Strongly do not chase!
She left on your wheelbarrow!
Why did you give her?
Dahl gave!
I had time to give her?
Do not you see?
Log in!
- It is you - the owner's daughter?
- Yes.
Let me introduce myself - Angela Lombardi.
I said, your clicker left?
Maybe I could replace it?
- You ?
!
- Why not?
I started peddler under the counter on the boulevards.
And then, I have always loved the circus.
Monsieur.
Mademoiselle ready to replace the strikers.
I'll be glad if go up.
These pretty girls can not come.
But I can offer only 1000 per week.
More I did not ask.
I ran, Kvedchi waiting for me.
Goodbye, Mademoiselle.
- Goodbye.
- It's too good to be true.
Two days of work, and then...
- Let's see.
Agreed?
- Agreed.
Come later.
I will teach you the science barkers.
Intricacies of the profession.
It is an art!
Thank you!
You can sit down?
Do not worry.
- What You take?
- I do not know.
Coffee with cream.
Do you want to eat?
They then very tasty sandwiches.
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.
- Coffee with cream!
- Coffee with cream.
When we get married, we'll be there every day in the cafe.
How rich.
And yet, you know, I thought about our honeymoon.
We're going to Venice.
There's so wonderful in Venice!
How?
- I still have not been there...
- Does not matter, tell me!
Well, first, we make love in a gondola...
O Kvedchi!
- What?
- Well, let's say.
And then?
- And then...
- Expensive Cognac in the big glass.
- Okay, sir.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Want uyd置?
- No no.
- All right, I was hired.
- Well done!
You were fast.
Yes.
Now you have to find a guy who suspiciously quickly become rich.
Who is spending right and left.
You know what I mean?
I understand.
It's probably a whore, and I do not want her here.
I think her dad has already hired.
I tell you that he will dismiss it, and together with Gina!
But Gina had gone.
She left and came back.
And even stole your father's jeep.
Our jeep!
Do you like crabs in the pot?
A string beans...
love?
"Very fine"...
You are pampered!
Yes, but...
If you want to nibble on, will have to begin to sit at the table.
How funny!
When I want, I'm so merry!
Well,
Figured you about money?
I asked the question!
- Yes.
That's what I'll tell you:
If Fredo and his woman would find the money,
Them and they run away.
And some will remain with the nose - and it's you!
- You think?
- Yes.
How to drink to!
Fredo left you here to his hands were free.
But... the case is not yet completed.
You do untie we rush back, I'm taking the money,
And we divide them into two.
- You're going to work with me?
- Yes.
I had been thinking about it.
- ABOUT!
Well, Fernand, I here you simply hold oaf!
Cigarettes do not want?
I want.
- I do not have pockets, and I do not smoke.
- I have.
Here, in the pocket.
Tell me,
Who's there?
Do not be nervous, dear.
It's great, is not it?
You want to know who's here, right?
Now you know it.
- Gina!
- You start talking?
Gina!
Do Cinco never had any money.
And now - there.
According Kvedchi he gave Marcella.
Fortune Teller?
Sis Bastia?
Yes.
But it is certainly not true.
- Well, hang out.
Marcella had nothing to do with it!
You bastard!
So you gave the money to her Sis?
You're crazy!
Be polite!
Will be explained with his maid.
I believe her.
Fredo also believe!
You are one against.
And you're out of the game!
- Look, Pepe, I can help you!
You do not leave me here to die alone!
You're not alone here.
Madam - the neighborhood.
Lucky!
Hey!
Repeat.
- Okay, sir.
- How are you doing?
- At zero.
I put out the door.
It seems that fear of something.
Every fear, then there is a reason.
I'm sure that something was there.
- Could buy me a beer!
- Get fat from it.
- What's Your Number?
- 900 thousand!
I left 2 more ball.
I'll become a millionaire!
Yes.
Here the fair roaming gunmen.
You they probably know.
Who's on the phone?
Interrogate circus acrobat Dario,
More and Gina, a dancer.
But who are you?
Answer!
Hello?
Hello!
Hello...
You'll say, old owl ?
!
Will you speak ?
!
Will you say, vile creature ?
!
Hell!
- You know the kind of Dario?
- Of course, it is our acrobat.
- Where is he?
- Probably in his trailer.
The first right.
- Thank you.
- What do they want from Dario?
- This is probably due to Bastia.
From such people - always nothing but trouble!
Dad!
Where is Dad?
- What happened?
Marcella!
It's not moving!
I think she's dead!
Well, it just is not enough...
- This is certainly the heart deposited.
- It was in the evening departure!
- Your mother's looking for you, Kvedchi!
- You do not work, she is angry.
Okay, I go.
Here is a gift!
- She has always had a weak heart.
- I say that there is filthy!
It is, for sure, mutila with his brother.
- With a guy that was a greeter?
- Yes.
Doctor she is no longer needed.
So, parted, move!
You go out there!
Fast!
- What did I tell you!
- Maybe it's her brother?
This is murder!
She kept the house all your money!
I think it strangled.
She has marks on her neck.
Call to the site, let people send.
Yes, chef!
Expenses on a trailer!
All forbidden to leave the area of the holidays!
This is murder!
- I told you!
- I have long sought.
Yes.
Only you - not a policeman.
4 dead man in Marseilles, 5 - at Pigalle.
Who is next?
If the case begins with a fight, a fight over it.
- What do we do?
- I
- I do not know, and you - to collect the suitcase.
- You want me to leave?
- So you escaped.
We are going to fight, I feel.
A is not a ladies' game.
Rate - 14 million, and we have something to lose.
So I prefer you to leave the game.
We are all divided into two.
May, will continue?
Years in prison for two is not divided.
When the motley your age gets 10 years - this is the end.
Are you ready for 10 years wearing a gray robe and slippers tinkering?
I do not care.
Do not say that.
As long as you have the conscience of nothing.
Or almost nothing.
And tomorrow everything is going to be different.
Return to Paris and wait quietly.
Calmly wait what?
Exhaust itself?
Ask yourself, have arrested you or not?
Ask myself, what I bring, - oranges or flowers.
Shut up!
For fun you have to pay.
Life - is a journey.
I would like to go first class.
I have always loved silk shirts and shoes made to order.
And I have not traded in a row, it would be illogical.
- What's the matter?
- It's me!
Discover!
I thought I told you to go back and wait there?
Disaster struck, Fredo.
Chick Fernand came to explore, and I...
I caught it.
She uttered a few words about Marcello.
That she was involved.
More.
You went to Marcelle?
Yes.
To ask her any questions.
It is necessary to pass the buck, Fredo!
- Wait a minute!
Marcella?
Marcella!
I assure you, I have nothing to do with!
In her heart she refused.
Fredo, you're...
You do not leave me?
Where do I, in your opinion, go?
Where do you want.
To the Greeks.
Okay.
Then I will come back to the villa.
I left them there either.
Then finish them off for a full set.
Will you come, Fredo?
You do not leave me?
- No.
I will ask the President himself, so he put us together for the company.
Why did he kill her?
Misunderstanding, as it said Fernand.
Protracted misunderstanding.
Pepe was too stupid, Fernand - too cunning.
Police will be here soon.
It's time to disappear.
I?
You go back to Paris.
Come from time to time in the "In Field".
I'll leave it to you the news.
If all goes well.
Here's yet to wait.
No.
They you more useful.
This is unlikely.
The car, for sure, in the search.
What are you going to do?
- I'll go as soon as possible.
Either way, if I do not go down after 5 minutes they will rise.
Next!
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot!
What?
Turns?
- Minute!
I sang this number 3 years ago Karpatto.
Pepe - a professional, and I have lost the knack.
My poor!
- Well, hurry up!
What are you naplela about my sister?
I'm not used to me about extinguished cigarettes.
In general, I would have passed anyone but you.
What's more, I just repeated what I was told.
- Who?
- Kvedchi.
Git!
- You think this is it?
- Definitely!
It's okay.
Stagnant blood.
It will pass.
How did you get here?
I follow you on a jeep owner.
Keep.
- With "Hold"?
Popey.
That's it.
Come on.
Bastia foul!
Bastia was blown away!
They still know enough!
Come on.
- Listen!
In minutes as the score goes!
No.
Do not for a minute.
It can wait.
Oh, you... you bastard!
Yes, it can wait!
He accused me of stealing receipts from storage.
He even guided me the gun.
Bring it in a report.
What's next?
Nothing.
He saw that I was not to blame, and calmed down.
Okay, good.
We have already moved.
The owner of the circus - are you?
Go.
You can be free.
But do not leave your trailer.
You must have a fortune of money?
- Yes.
So what?
If I had to kill all those who I have money,
You would have to double the staff.
- We can disagree?
- That's really not!
Well that ended this market?
I think they are looking for a suitcase.
Will conduct searches.
- By what authority?
- I do not know, but it's true.
Let there be sought!
The one who searches will find!
The search...
The search...
The search...
Stay here.
Hey, there!
Where are you?
Someone looking for?
Get down.
No, I...
I have come to my sister.
- Ah, the fortune-teller - your sister?
- Yes.
Well, okay, I go to next time.
Show me the documents!
The one who searches will find...
And find what?
Kvedchi!
Those guys!
Those guys will not find!
Those guys!
Hey, Kvedchi, open the door!
What are you doing, Kvedchi?
Tell me!
You open it or not ?
!
Are you crazy?
Why do you close?
- It is necessary.
Carriages will be searched.
What's burning?
Yes, it's money!
- This is mine, do not touch!
It is mine!
Money!
Do not touch the money!
They curse!
Yes, leave the money!
They curse!
Gimme!
Give it to me!
Thanks to you, give here!
I tell you, it will be searched!
If they find us...
Exploded gas cylinder?
- It's in Kvedchi!
- Faster!
Faster!
Do not approach!
Get away!
Here it is dangerous!
Save yourself!
Caution!
Caution, Fernand!

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
There's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I've got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!

Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Yourjacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
There's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd betterjoin us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don'tjust sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don'tjust stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools then the children are fools
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Boris is working day and night.
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Verónica.
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement.
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders..
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma..
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down..
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee..
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee....
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside..
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there..
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding..
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline....
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once..
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave me alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.?
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well....
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!

Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, with long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".
THE CRANES ARE FLYING
Written by V. ROZOV
Directed by M. KALATOZOV
An Order of Lenin Film Studio "Mosfilm" production, 1957
Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Verónica.
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I don't know.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself, you know?
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement.
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders...
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma..
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down..
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee...
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march.
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside...
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there...
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding...
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the hell I've got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
- I'm doing all right as a girl.
- Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave me alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse?
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
Here you are.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
Feodor?
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
"Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones With long beaks they fly"
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your "cranes like ships."

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
a harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet, Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock, and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
This "work" of his will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis, not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass their parents, then the parents are bad and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin, but I can't help myself!
You understand?
I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front, my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right.
So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something more important... talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know, my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Where's the notice?
Nothing yet.
I don't understand why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see.
Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No.
Why should I rush it?
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go.
You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go.
I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts!
Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat, I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything, not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding I'm going to make a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit, and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
- Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes.
He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying, especially now that you know so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you...
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
I'm not her fiancé.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here.
From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry.
This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee...
- And the Communist Youth League...
What you want to say is:
"Comrade Boris, fight to the last drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet and exceed our production quotas."
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls, and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world aren't going as smoothly as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
When our men come back, you'll envy us.
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build a monument reaching to the sky with every one of their names in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go.
Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry.
She'll come.
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack?
It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous, we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites won't even let us talk!
For some reason he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you'll stay with us from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense!
Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go!
Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
- At last!
Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys, and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's...
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot!
You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky l...
Shut up.
We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods, and then we're safe.
I'm tired.
Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded.
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 3 26 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia.
We can't retreat much farther.
This is what's become of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
"Cranes like ships sailing in the sky."
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
- Stop!
...45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris, but everyone says he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself forever.
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting than you do, but he's the boss.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica, you're impossible.
You're always so irritable, and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful.
But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great, but attach a little something to it and I'm sure Antonina will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing.
Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay.
They'll figure it out.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov, or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know.
That's just an excuse.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade a handsome guy like you, a real hero, for some rat sitting out the war at home!
It's she who's forfeited her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass the little test of time.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
"The symptoms of such compound fractures depend on the degree of changes in the joints, as well as on the location."
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet.
We'll go find Mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday, we'd take a car and go from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry.
I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything, but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone named Boris.
"My only love, happy birthday to you."
On this day you came into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily as we did before when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual all the Philharmonic's cars are taken, and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire, and this time, getting a new one will be practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room, I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
I've thought about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out in the first place?
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind someone else's back.
I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely.
There's still a blockade around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you.
I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you heard from him?
A lot of things could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
"Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones With long beaks they fly"
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your "cranes like ships."

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
a harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet, Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock, and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
This "work" of his will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis, not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass their parents, then the parents are bad and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin, but I can't help myself!
You understand?
I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front, my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right.
So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something more important... talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know, my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Where's the notice?
Nothing yet.
I don't understand why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see.
Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No.
Why should I rush it?
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go.
You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go.
I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts!
Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat, I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything, not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding I'm going to make a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit, and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
- Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes.
He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying, especially now that you know so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you...
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
I'm not her fiancé.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here.
From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry.
This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee...
- And the Communist Youth League...
What you want to say is:
"Comrade Boris, fight to the last drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet and exceed our production quotas."
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls, and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world aren't going as smoothly as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
When our men come back, you'll envy us.
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build a monument reaching to the sky with every one of their names in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go.
Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry.
She'll come.
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack?
It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous, we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites won't even let us talk!
For some reason he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you'll stay with us from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense!
Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go!
Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
- At last!
Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys, and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's...
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot!
You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky l...
Shut up.
We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods, and then we're safe.
I'm tired.
Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded.
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 3 26 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia.
We can't retreat much farther.
This is what's become of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
"Cranes like ships sailing in the sky."
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
- Stop!
...45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris, but everyone says he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself forever.
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting than you do, but he's the boss.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica, you're impossible.
You're always so irritable, and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful.
But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great, but attach a little something to it and I'm sure Antonina will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing.
Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay.
They'll figure it out.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov, or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know.
That's just an excuse.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade a handsome guy like you, a real hero, for some rat sitting out the war at home!
It's she who's forfeited her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass the little test of time.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
"The symptoms of such compound fractures depend on the degree of changes in the joints, as well as on the location."
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet.
We'll go find Mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday, we'd take a car and go from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry.
I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything, but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone named Boris.
"My only love, happy birthday to you."
On this day you came into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily as we did before when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual all the Philharmonic's cars are taken, and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire, and this time, getting a new one will be practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room, I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
I've thought about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out in the first place?
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind someone else's back.
I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely.
There's still a blockade around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you.
I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you heard from him?
A lot of things could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
"Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones With long beaks they fly"
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your "cranes like ships."

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
A harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet, Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock, and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
This "work" of his will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis, not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass their parents, then the parents are bad and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin, but I can't help myself!
You understand?
I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front, my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right.
So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something more important... talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know, my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Where's the notice?
Nothing yet.
I don't understand why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see.
Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No.
Why should I rush it?
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go.
You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go.
I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts!
Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat, I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything, not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding I'm going to make a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit, and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
- Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes.
He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying, especially now that you know so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you...
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
I'm not her fiancé.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here.
From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry.
This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee...
- And the Communist Youth League...
What you want to say is:
"Comrade Boris, fight to the last drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet and exceed our production quotas."
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls, and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world aren't going as smoothly as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
When our men come back, you'll envy us.
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build a monument reaching to the sky with every one of their names in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go.
Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry.
She'll come.
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack?
It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous, we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites won't even let us talk!
For some reason he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you'll stay with us from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense!
Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go!
Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
- At last!
Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys, and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's...
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot!
You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky l...
Shut up.
We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods, and then we're safe.
I'm tired.
Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded.
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 24 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 326 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia.
We can't retreat much farther.
This is what's become of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
"Cranes like ships sailing in the sky."
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
- Stop!
...45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris, but everyone says he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself forever.
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting than you do, but he's the boss.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica, you're impossible.
You're always so irritable, and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful.
But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great, but attach a little something to it and I'm sure Antonina will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing.
Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay.
They'll figure it out.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov, or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know.
That's just an excuse.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade a handsome guy like you, a real hero, for some rat sitting out the war at home!
It's she who's forfeited her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass the little test of time.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
"The symptoms of such compound fractures depend on the degree of changes in the joints, as well as on the location."
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet.
We'll go find Mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday, we'd take a car and go from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry.
I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything, but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone named Boris.
"My only love, happy birthday to you."
On this day you came into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily as we did before when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual all the Philharmonic's cars are taken, and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire, and this time, getting a new one will be practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room, I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
I've thought about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out in the first place?
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind someone else's back.
I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely.
There's still a blockade around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you.
I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you heard from him?
A lot of things could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Oh, mighty God
Please take my soul, to ask You why You torture me
Take my soul or alleviate the suffering
Oh, God, are You...
I ask Your forgiveness
I know You exist, my heart shivers hearing Your name
But I wonder, and You are the Most Merciful and Righteous
Why are we led to temptation?
Why does sin take over virtue?
Why does the evil in our souls overcome the goodness?
Why does one sin then remorse and ask for forgiveness?
I have committed many sins but I am confused;
was it my deprivation from my mother that pushed me towards evil?
My parents were divorced when I was two
And my father was responsible for bringing me up
He was my father, brother and mother as well
He granted me his youth, he lived only to please me
Nevertheless, nothing compensated for the loss of my mother
I envied any girl that had a mother
In a girl's life, there are things only a mother understands
These things were like a barrier between me and my dad when I started to turn into a young woman
It made me feel lonely and deprived
My father was the only thing I really possessed
I didn't demand for my rights as a daughter only, but more
I considered myself responsible for his happiness
We lived with my uncle who was only a few years older than I was
I was the lady of the house
My face had no sinister look to it
It is an innocent face, like that of a child who hadn't yet peen polluted by life's ugliness
I started my evil deeds by pulling small pranks that later developed into big disasters
Even my schoolmates were not exempted from them
Kawthar was in love with my cousin, Medhat
I convinced her falsely that Medhat loves me
I was able to part between them and ruin their lives just because I liked being evil but I would cry also
I cried for long nights, in regret for what I had done
And I was forever sleepless
SLEEPLESS

Then came the day when I felt my life was really falling apart
I was sixteen, attending boarding school
My father came and took permission from the principal to take me home
You know something, Nadia
I don't like your staying in a boarding school
Why?
It's a great school
You know I sent you there because I had to
After you've grown like this, you couldn't stay home without a woman to look after you
Nanny Halima is like a mother to me
Well, at the end of the day, she's still a nanny
I have worried about you all my life
There were so many little issues in your life that I couldn't approach you with
Only a woman could talk to you about those issues
I never complained
Yes, but we have to live together forever
You know, when you get married,
I will make sure that your husband will take us both
We can never live together though unless I married
- Married?
- Yes, Nadia
I have lived without marriage for 14 years, for your sake
And now I married for your sake too
The only condition in the woman I was going to marry was that she would take care of you, and I found her
- I am sure you'll love her
- You should love her
If you love her, Nadia, I will love her
- Congratulations
- Just a plain congratulation?
I only want you to be happy, Daddy
Hello, Nadia
You're more beautiful than your picture
Aunt Safiya
Planning to get drunk, Aziz?
This is your third drink
What to do?
I'm starving
Looks like Nadia won't appear unless I go get her
How posh!
Bless your hands, Safy
See the difference a lady's presence makes in a house!
What have you done to yourself?
What is this hairstyle?
- Is it ugly?
- No, not at all
You look just like Aunt Safiya now
I am not as cute as Nadia
Nadia is beautiful, have a seat
Sit over there, Nadia, in the seat across me
Come on, darling
It's our fate to take the back seat
Well, get yourself a bride
- Here's my bride!
- I'd never give her to you!
You are always at night clubs!
When I was young, I wanted to marry Daddy
Well, he's taken now, I am the only one left
No man in this whole world is worthy of Nadia
Not even Daddy?
Your father is one of a kind
But I hope you find a man like him
- What's for vegetables?
- Messakaa
Oh, God!
It doesn't go well with whiskey
I have a long night yet, tonight is the big night
Do you hear that?
All his nights are like that
Actually, I asked the cook to make Messakaa because I learned that Nadia likes it
Tell me your favorite meals and I'll make them for you
- I like late nights
- And borrowing money
Oh, now you are reminding me of the 100 pounds I owe you!
- I'm not eating then!
- Why, Aziz?
Let him go, he probably has a date;
he's been looking at his watch
You are not a niece, you are a wicked mother-in-law!
- Good bye
- Good bye
Stop drinking, would you?
Good night
Will you sleep this early?
Yes, I'm a bit tired
Good night, darling
Don't forget to close the balcony door
- Good night, Auntie
- Good night, Nadia
- It's getting cold
- I don't think so
It's going to turn on fire
As long as you are by my side, I feel on fire
- What are you doing?
- Getting warm
This is not how to do it..
Hasn't Nadia woken up yet?
Not yet, sir
Put this vase on the cupboard over there
Halima, wake Nadia up, it's ten o' clock
- Good morning, Nadia
- Good morning
I hope you get married soon
Your father, Lady Safiya and your uncle are waiting for you
- Uncle is awake?
- Yes
Everything has changed since Lady Safiya came
I feel that everything in the house is newer and prettier
The furniture is still the same, it was just too close together
I never thought I would ever wake up this early
Early?
It's 10:30!
Tomorrow, breakfast is at 8:00, we'll force you out of bed
Your father's marriage is trouble for me and you
- Good morning
- Good morning, dear
We should take Nadia to the doctor
I think she's a bit pale, she needs some vitamins
Vitamins?
No, all she needs is a husband
Husband?
Who could we fool into marrying her?
Remember when I asked you to make me scrambled eggs
You burned your hand, and nearly burned the house down!
We all did that as kids
I will teach her everything, she'll be just like me
I wish she'd be only half of you
Why do you want to marry me off?
Bored of me?
Safiya?
No one is answering
You answer it
Hello, how are you, Auntie?
Thursday?
What time?
Seven?
Definitely, yes, we'll be there
Bye-bye, Auntie
You know what, Daddy?
I'll never speak to my friend Aliya again
Why?
She's a nice, funny friend
I was once at her place, she left me alone and talked to her boyfriend on the phone
She was talking to him while her mother was sitting next to us
Be fair!
She was talking to him, pretending he was a girl
The strange thing is her tongue didn't slip once
- Live and let live
- Believe her, Ahmed, girls these days can do anything
Who wants to come to the club for some fun?
I'd love to but I have things to do
- Take Nadia with you
- I am tired
- We'll expect you for lunch
- I've forgotten what junk food is like!
Let's go
I am very sorry, miss
I apologies again, a hundred times
- Okay
- Okay what?
- Accept my apology
- What if I don't?
I won't eat or sleep
- It's over
- Thanks, see you around
- Anyone bugging you?
- Not at all
I know Mostafa, he thinks he's still a youngster
I don't like young men anyway
He's a playboy, everyday a new girlfriend
And you are straight?
Where were you just now?
Playing backgammon
So, was your opponent a brunette or a blonde?
Watch it, Ahmed
- Yes?
- Is this Mr. Mostafa?
Yes, who is this?
I am a girl, don't you like talking to women?
I am sure you would enjoy talking to me
No one prodded me to call you, no
I happen to like you
So you've seen me, you know me
It's not fair, you have the advantage!
This is selfishness!
You can imagine me as we speak
But I will always be asking myself: who is she?
Is she pretty or ugly?
Who told her to call me?
Be patient, you won't regret it
Later, when I feel comfortable about you
Who told you I needed more women?
Did I beg you to call me and test me - to see if I am worthy of you or not?
Wait a minute
- Wait a second
- I'll hang up
First you didn't want to talk, now you can't wait for a second?
This phone thing is old-fashioned
Times have changed
There are now clubs and social gatherings for people to meet and know each other
It's not logical for a girl to reveal half her body at the beach and then hide her identity on the phone
People have no time for such hypocrisy
Did you expect me to jump at you and say I loved you?
Since we've gone this far, please tell me your name
I will count till three
If you don't tell me I'll hang up 1, 2, 3
- Wrong number
- My name is Nadia Lotfy
My father is Ahmed Lotfy, we live in Dokki
You saw me and you liked me
You even threw your ball at me this morning
Great!
When will we meet?
Please, Nadia
Since we will meet anyway, then the sooner, the better
Tomorrow at 4:30 in front of the Horse-Riding Club
No, 4:30
I am confused, almost lost
As if an invisible hand pushed me towards an unknown fate
I needed someone by my side
I needed someone to guide me to the path of security
But I had no one
I couldn't ask my father's opinion, nor his wife's
I felt just as lonely as I had before
I feel afraid of Mostafa
He is stronger and older than I am, and more experienced
Should I turn back?
I think I should
- Should it be a convertible?
- I'll cover it for you
I saw you before but I didn't think you were this young
I am not young, I am 18
- How old do you think I am?
- 25?
I wish!
I am 36
Double your age
So?
They say a man is " double" the woman
A man gets two women's share
So, if I am 36,
I should be dating two 18-year-olds!
I was afraid someone would see me getting in your car
Tell me more about yourself
You tell first, I have heard horror stories of you!
Listen up now
See, as I was saying...
- He put his hanky
- On the sand
- And put his hand
- In her hand
What do they want from us?
They have done nothing wrong
The street is just as much theirs as it is ours
They saw a nice girl, they can look as they please
I've been thinking of you!
How are your mom and sisters?
Great.
Were you really thinking of me?
There's something about you today, you are happy
True, but I don't know why
I will make you dresses that will make men fly after you
You want to get rid of me?
All girls want to get rid of their families and marry
I don't want to get rid of Dad, where is he?
On his way. go change for supper
Are you home?
I've been thinking of you since I left you
Are you angry with me?
I waved at you when I got out of your car - you left as if you were thinking: good riddance!
To prove you wrong, let's meet tomorrow, when?
I'll give you my address at home
Why not?
If not, let's meet at a cafe
Can't we meet else where?
At the Aquarium Park?
I'm too old for this
But Mostafa...
Promise me you won't do anything to bother me
I promise you.
It's 33, Kasr El Nil Street
The 12th floor, apartment 3, at 5 o'clock
I was supposed to meet him at five
But I found myself out of the house at eleven to look up his place
It was a huge building, I passed it hesitantly
I felt everyone was watching me
As if they knew I would be back at five to meet Mostafa in his apartment
Then I went to the back of the building as if I were studying the scene of the would-be crime
I was afraid that someone would see me
But the building had offices for lawyers and doctors, companies and a dressmaker
If someone saw me, I'd say I was at the dressmaker's
Would you like to take a look around?
I was looking for a picture of a girl that looked like you
I don't know where I saw it
- Do you draw?
- Listen up
I like art but I don't draw
I like music but I can't play it
I love flowers but can't grow them
I love novels but I can't write them and I adore beauty but cannot create it
Would you like to listen to music?
- How many women were here before me?
- A lot
Am I just another page in a diary?
Ask me this question after two weeks
By then I will know how you stand compared to them
There is one obvious thing I can tell you now
- What is that?
- You are the youngest
- I am not young
- You are 16 years old!
- I'm 18
- Still the youngest!
I never admired younger men
You like older men?
You are the first man I have ever known
There is a twenty-year difference between us
When you are 38, I will be 56
You'll be in your prime and I'll be done
You will be great at 56
I worry for you, you don't know what I am or what I can do to your life
- You worry for me, that's enough
- Aren't you afraid of me?
Not any more
When I first walked in, I almost died of fear
I was afraid you put something to drug me in the chocolate
Mostafa kept his promise
I walked out, untouched
I went for a second time, and a third
But he was always conservative, frigid
I enjoyed his amusing conversations about his life, his books, his experiences
I also talked to him, about everything in my life
He knew what was going on at home
I feel sorry for Aunt Safiya
- Why?
- Dad doesn't love her
Why did he marry her then?
For my sake, to take care of me
But why her?
He could have married someone he loved
She's a modest housewife, from bed to kitchen and from kitchen to bed
She's probably fat, ugly and illiterate
Not too fat or too ugly
She can barely read or write though
You have to make him love her
You can't force someone to love someone
If he married her for your sake, you can make him love her
I can't believe you love me unless you love everyone else including Aunt Safy
I was happy with the new life that Mostafa opened before my very eyes
But that wasn't enough for me
There was something I was waiting to happen
I was waiting for him to kiss me
Every love story begins with a kiss
So where was my kiss?
Maybe he didn't love me or considered me a kid
Maybe there was another woman in his life
I wonder who else you are seeing?
No one, these days
A bachelor like you with no woman in his life?
A man in my age can go without a woman forever
You are 36, my dad remarried at the age of 39
He found a woman worth marrying
And you haven't?
Not yet
What is this?
Whose earring is it?
It's broken.
I wonder who broke it?
Not me, it was broken when I found it
I love this record
Have you excused me from the promise?
What promise?
Remember the promise I made before your first visit?
I don't remember
Your earring, Nadia
Thank God it's not broken
- When will you come again?
- Tomorrow
- Welcome
- Excuse me
It's 6:15 and Nadia isn't down yet
I sent Nanny to hurry her up
What do you think of Dr. Helmy, my cousin?
A good lad, I have no objection to him
He's a doctor, from a good family, very decent too
She doesn't want to marry me off out of love for me
She wants to get rid of me to take over the house
She is very kind and she loves you
Love or no love, I am not meeting anyone!
Aren't you ready yet, Nadia?
I am tired, I can't come down
I am sure you'll be delighted
They are guests, and very nice people
What shall we say to them?
Get dressed if you love me at all
Okay
I can't come tonight, I am sorry
But tomorrow, I will surprise you
You'll find out tomorrow
No, thanks
You were always talkative, Helmy, why are you quiet now?
I have been blabbing all day put she won't answer me
You must've been telling her about the hospital and patients
You have annoyed her, talk about something else
I will talk about poetry, about music, about the high dam even, if only she'd answer
What do you say if you came over for supper tomorrow?
I have no problem, what about you, Nadia?
Tomorrow is my sister's birthday
- Do you have to go?
- And Mom wants me to stay over
Why?
The chauffeur will pick you up after the party
Mom insists, I don't want my sister to get upset
Please, Dad
Okay
- Then we'll expect you after tomorrow
- Okay
We'll miss you, sweetie
I'll be pack first thing tomorrow
Wait a minute, Nadia
What's this?
This isn't suitable for a party
I'll pick out another dress for you
This is very suitable
The party is full of kids anyway
Go see why the elevator has stopped
We don't need this, see what's wrong
- What's up with you?
- I'm spending the night here
Have I done anything wrong?
No, life did you wrong
I'm supposed to be at my mother's today
Maybe they will ask about me
So the only solution is to keep their phone busy all the time
Nanny Halima hung up
Now, they can't make calls or get calls
Do you know what I really want?
To walk with you in the street, in front of everyone
To tell everyone that your beauty is mine
Your eyes are mine
Your lips are mine
Turn around
Don't peek
I need that dress tonight, Teresa
We are going out tonight, thank you
Your dress turned out marvelous, you will be a star
Where?
Shushu's party tonight, all the suitors will be chasing you
I don't think I can make it
- Why?
- I am worn out
- How's your mom and sisters?
- Fine, thanks
Go upstairs and rest, by night time, you'll be okay
I want to tell you something
What is it?
Tell me, dear
I am in love
What?
In love, with a guy
You mean someone will come and propose?
Why are you so shy about it?
Rest assured, I'll talk to your father and settle everything
As long as he is a good person, and you're in love, why not?
Consider yourself married, congratulations
No one is coming to propose
Didn't you just say there's someone?
Yes, but he won't propose
Why won't he, if he loves you?
- He's not the marrying type
- What?
I mean, we haven't discussed marriage yet
Apdou!
Those servants are a nuisance!
She refused to share my misery
Mostafa is all I need
But does he really love me?
Will he marry me?
I don't think so
He runs away from any responsibility
He only spared my virginity because - he doesn't want to be responsible for turning me into a woman
- Welcome, welcome
- Hello
Tonight, you'll be everyone's envy, Mr. Lotfy;
the sun is to your right and the moon to your left
- Hello, Mr. Mostafa
- Hello, Mrs. Shushu
- I think you know each other
- We haven't met
- Mr. Lotfy
- How do you do?
My niece, Mrs. Lotfy
And our sweet little Nadia
And Mr. Mostafa El Sherif, you have all heard of him
We see each other at the club
But we have never met before tonight
This is Aziz, Lotfy's brother
Yes, we've met
Please
Are you related to Khalil El Sherif who was - in the Higher Institute of Commerce?
- My brother
- What a coincidence!
We are old friends and schoolmates
Where is he now?
Nadia!
Hello!
I miss you so much
Ever since you left school, you haven't contacted me, weren't we friends?
Guess who I saw yesterday
Damn these people!
Why do they make such a fuss?
What luck brought me into this blabbermouth's path?
When will she stop her nonsense?
- May I have this dance?
- Sorry
Safiya is laughing more than she usually does
What has he told her?
I mustn't leave them
Excuse me
You have very bold opinions
No, not too bold
I just don't like what people are doing
Everyone is doing wrong and if someone is right they call him bold, crazy or a criminal
Which opinion was he discussing with her?
I know his conversation is intoxicating
Was he trying to impress her?
They play a big role in peoples' lives, what do you say, Miss?
I saw a marvelous statue depicting this idea in a museum in Rome
That was Bernini's statue
I must take part in their conversation
I must say something
I mustn't be weak in front of my stepmother
I can tell them about the sculptor that killed himself
Mostafa is the one that told me that story
But I must prove myself
I always listen to that program
It's one of the most important radio programs
Have you heard of the intellectual butcher Apu Nekaya?
It's an honor to have a citizen like him here
All the women are admiring your dress tonight, Safiya
They are asking me about your dressmaker
Isn't she called Teresa?
I made this dress myself
It is really classy.
I think...
Mrs. Shushu is really strange
She put me amidst people I don't know
I felt like a stranger
So I thought I wouldn't be rude and left them
You shouldn't have, Aziz
People at parties should mingle
You promised me a dance, Nadia.. if I may, Uncle
- It's all right
- Please
May I have this dance, Mrs. Safiya?
- If you allow me, sir
- Go ahead
Two ice-creams, right?
Isn't it too cold over here?
The smoke inside is suffocating
We are late, we should be leaving anyway
Excuse me
They say Mostafa is a good farmer
His feddan yielded 7 kantars of cotton last year
- He is so cocky
- Aren't all bachelors?
Am I that cocky?
If you want people to stop calling you cocky, get married
Safiya, you are the last one I will go to for advice
Why did Safiya allow him to dance with her like that?
There must be something between them
Maybe they agreed to talk on the phone
Or maybe even...
They will do like he did with me
I am very sorry to be late, Nadia
Why didn't we meet at your place this time?
- Let's change
- Change?
Did you enjoy yesterday's party?
Looks like you enjoyed it the most
Because you were so pretty
That's why you talked and danced with me all night!
- What do you mean?
- Aunt Safiya!
You gave me a very bad impression of her
She seems nice and pretty, your dad must love her madly
- Only Dad?
- Anyone else you know?
- You!
- Give me a break!
Why did you dance with her like you did?
She was dancing with respect
She is very respectable, everyone who sees her will respect her
Are you mad?
What will you have?
Yesterday Safiya drank juice
Strange that she doesn't drink alcohol at all
She must be highly educated and self-confident
Two cups of raspberry juice
Nadia!
Nadia!
What day is today, Ahmed?
May 3
Hey, it's our anniversary!
We've been together for a year, have I made you happy?
You have made me the happiest man on earth
I hope our happiness lasts forever
- What've you prepared?
- Nothing much
We will all take our tea in the garden
Isn't Nadia back yet?
She's on her way probably, it isn't 12 yet
What about Aziz?
Looks like he drank too much in the party
I will go on a small errand and come pack
Bye-bye
- Are you going out?
- Yes, dear
Please stay with me today, don't go out
Is something wrong?
Are you ill?
I just wanted to spend some time with you
I'll only be away for an hour
- Hello, Nadia
- Where is Aunt Safiya?
Upstairs in Aziz's apartment
30 blacksmiths with 60 hammers are banging in my head!
Why do you drink if you can't handle it?
I can't handle drinking?
I'll drink a barrel of wine
Your aunt had bad whiskey
No way, you're just growing old
Drink up
Yuck!
This tastes like cod-liver oil!
Are you here, Nadia?
Where did you come from?
Come help me drag this man out of bed
Pull his other leg
No, not my leg!
I think I will sit like this for another week
This afternoon, you must come down
Today is our anniversary
- Really?
- Happy anniversary
Hope both of you are married soon too
Me?
God forbid!
I am going downstairs, if you want me, call
I fear you will catch cold
You don't have to celebrate while I'm sick, do you?
You have an excuse for not getting a gift
- Thank you so much
- Congratulations
Thank you, darling, it's the prettiest earring
There is something prettier
Wow!
It matches the earrings perfectly
- When did you get it?
- I have my ways
I knew you would call your jeweler to pick a gift
So I called him and got my gift in bed!
Thanks, I hope I return it in your marriage soon
I won't marry before Nadia marries
I am worried about Nadia these days
- Why, Dad?
- You look pale and weak
Your eyes are tired, like you haven't slept for ages
I am a bit exhausted
You should see a doctor
Doctor Kenawy will pass by, let him check on her
You won't go out today?
That's a precedent!
- He's getting old
- Never!
It's just the clean life
I am not used to sleeping early and eating good food
Thanks to Aunt Safiya
Ever since you have come, and he's always home
Yes, she spoiled me
- Happy anniversary
- Many happy returns
Dear Mother,
I kiss you a thousand kisses
I fear I will wet you with my tears
I cry so much that I can no longer sleep
Imagine that I live among cheaters, in silence
The cheater is Aunt Safiya
She is cheating on Dad and with whom?
My uncle!
It's been going on like this for months
I saw them in my uncle's apartment
She was kissing him and he was...
I can't describe what I saw
And my uncle, who never stayed home no longer stays out or eats out like before
He even pretends to be sick to stay home
She goes up to his flat till gullible Dad comes home
I have been crying ever since and I can't tell Dad
And with whom?
My uncle!
I saw them in my uncle's apartment
She was kissing him and he was...
I can't describe what I saw
Nadia!
Nadia!
Dad!
Why are you up till now?
I wrote a letter to Mom then tore it up
What's wrong, Dad?
Nothing, just a bit tired
Shall I make you a cup of tea?
Shall I wake up aunt Safiya?
No, I don't want anything now
You are back early
Didn't you want me to come home?
What are you saying?
Don't like what I'm saying?
What is wrong?
Leave me alone, stay away
Have you been drinking?
I am not drunk or staggering, am I?
- Good morning
- Good morning, Nadia
Eat your breakfast before it goes cold
I have no appetite
Mr. Aziz won't come down to breakfast
What's gotten into everyone?
No one wants to eat
Didn't Daddy have breakfast either?
I don't know what's wrong with your father
I'm afraid he might be ill and not telling us
Maybe he has problems with his estate
God be with him, and with you too, dear
You must see a doctor, you are so pale
No need, I'll just rest in my room all day
I'll go see what's wrong with your uncle too
Good morning, Dad, why are you back so early?
- Where is Safiya?
- Maybe in her room
- Where is she?
- Maybe she went out
- Where did she go?
- I was in my room, ask Nanny
Or maybe she went upstairs
Ahmed, why are you back so early?
You didn't expect me this early.
Where is Aziz?
- In his room
- And what are you doing here?
What do you see?
Don't we have servants to put away the laundry?
I never depend on them
What's wrong with you since yesterday?
- Nothing
- Wait, I'll come down with you
- I am going out
- It's almost lunch time
I have work, I came to tell Aziz something important but he's asleep
- He is sick
- Sick?
Won't we eat?
It's almost 3:15
Go ahead, I'll wait for your father
I am sick and left my room for your sakes
He's never been so late
- Here he is
- Apdou, bring lunch
I already ate
Safiya said you wanted me, what's up?
She told you already?
What else does she do besides wake me up and feed me?
Safiya has turned the house into an army camp!
I wanted to show you our account at the Credit Bank
But you've no time
You are up to it, leave the credit to me and the banks to you
Of course I am up to it, I handle the farm affairs, bank accounts, taxes
And I marry a woman to wake you up every morning
You married me to wake your brother up?
I didn't mean that
I won't accept it that you refer to me as "a woman"
I am sorry, I don't mean it
All will be well in the end
Is there anything you want me to do, Ahmed?
You never did anything
You wanted it this way
Well, let's forget this now
We are invited to my uncle's house tonight
Shall we go or should I apologize right now?
Why not go?
Is anything wrong?
I'm just asking
Excuse me from going, Dad, I am exhausted and won't make it
Whatever you like, Nadia.
Aziz, are you coming or not?
Are you inviting me or pushing me away?
You never liked these gatherings but all of a sudden you love them
Safiya made me like a lot of things even the silly things
Come in
- Good morning
- Good morning, Dad
Did you sleep well last night?
You know something?
I feel that we have drifted away from each other
Remember when we lived alone?
Those were the days
All we had was each other
I will never want anyone but you, Daddy
Wash up and eat your breakfast
You must eat well, you look weak and I am worried
We will go to the farm, take care of yourself
- Good morning, Aunt
- Good morning, darling
I wish you'd come with us put your father said no
I wonder what I'll do there alone
- I'll miss you
- We'll only be away for a few days
Uncle Aziz
What is it?
Imagine that Dad and Aunt Safiya went to the farm?
Really?
And she kept on begging him to take me put he wouldn't
He isn't himself these days, I am worried
I am worried too.
Can I ask a favor of you?
We are the only two people Dad has in this world
What if we went to the farm?
He seems upset, we must be there for him
Who knows what he is thinking of, or what he intends to do
Forget it, you go alone
Please take me, don't you love me?
Would you like me to take a cab to the farm?
Get up, please
Okay, I'll go, and come what may!
Hello
What brings you here?
I came to see if you were okay
How kind of you!
I want to talk to you, you are upset and you're having us worried
Uncle Aziz is very worried about you
Aunt Safiya said you were ill
She said I was ill?
What joy!
Finally you've grown up to be a young lady!
- Stop this nonsense, woman
- I'll make sherbet today
You came?
Welcome
They couldn't stay away from you, they came in our trail!
- It's my fault
- How could you leave me alone?
He's changed a lot!
I don't know what's wrong
God be with you
What is it?
He is acting strangely these days
Let's go back to Cairo
We just got here!
I am going back to Cairo, if you don't mind -
I am taking my wife and daughter with me
- What do you say?
- As you wish
Stick around, or can't you stay alone anywhere?
I want to stay where we can talk
Don't bother
Here you are, sir, juice for Miss Nadia
- The food is untouched
- They never eat
What happened to this house?
I'm going to the dressmaker
I'm going to the farm
Are you awake, Uncle?
Awake and dressed since early morning waiting for you all to leave, so as not to see any of you!
A husband and wife hate each other, what is it to us?
Pity!
If he leaves her, he'll never find anyone even half as good
Is she downstairs?
Both of them went out, each on his own
I am going to the club, want to come along?
I wish, but a friend of mine is coming over
Can I ask you to do me a favor?
Yes?
Before you go to the club, go to the dressmaker
Ask her to send me the blue dress
- Not the dressmaker!
- Please
- Why don't you call her?
- She isn't answering
I called the phone company, they said her phone is down
- Where is the driver?
- He's with Aunt Safiya
How can I go to a woman's dressmaker?
What will people say?
You don't have to go in
Your favors are all really silly
- Where does she live?
- You know that building..
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Leave me alone
Get out of here!
What is wrong, Nadia?
Is anything wrong?
Has something happened to your father?
Take your clothes and go back where you came from!
What are you saying?
I don't want to make a scene, what happened is bad enough
You don't belong here, this has always been a clean house and whoever lives here has to be clean!
What are you saying?
Are you crazy?
I divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee
- You are a cheater!
- You are crazy!
I was crazy the day I married you, I was fooled by you and your family
Now I know I gave my name to someone unworthy of it
You are divorced, get the hell out!
I will not answer you, but be sure that if I walk out,
I will never come pack again
Don't leave, please.
She is innocent, Dad
- Shut up!
- She is innocent!
She is a dishonest woman, you know that very well
- I saw them today
- I am the dishonest one
She doesn't even compare to you!
She is dishonest, she is a cheater!
Get out!
Out!
Aunt Safiya!
Aunt Safiya!
Aunt Safiya!
She has a nervous breakdown, she is very weak
Rest is very crucial, as I said
and a shot a day, and three of these pills daily after meals
and this medicine is to be taken only at night
Uncle Aziz, Uncle Aziz
I can't stay in this house one minute more!
We'll split up the farm and each one of us can go his own way
Better!
They say he broke the door and found them together!
He is a bastard!
He deserves to be burnt alive!
His sister-in-law?
He isn't to blame, she is older than him, she pursued him
He was going to shoot her but his daughter stopped him
Poor Nadia!
She hasn't left her bed ever since that day!
Master Aziz?
How do you do?
Miss Nadia, she is well
God, have mercy!
Nothing is worth all this grief, Nadia
You were wrong; she didn't betray you
You are still young, there are things you can't comprehend
And just to prove you are wrong, your uncle has told everyone he will marry her
Is this your final answer?
Do you need time to consider?
I have thought a lot about this and I thank you for your noble offer but you know what your brother said about us if we do get married now, everyone will believe him even those who were convinced of our innocence
and they will believe every single word
I don't care, any man would be honored to have you
I never had a brother, Aziz and I always considered you my brother, as you know
Let's keep it that way
Excuse me
The phone never stops ringing, and when I pick up the phone, no one answers
You go rest, and plug in the phone
Close the door
Where are you, Nadia?
Where have you been all this time?
I know you were sick, I called you fifty times
Thank you, Mostafa
Every time the phone rang and no one would answer, I would know it was you
Yes, I am better now
Dad isn't home yet, he spends a lot of time outside the house
He goes to bars?
Unbelievable!
He's never done that!
And how have you been, Mostafa?
I miss you a lot
Don't miss me, I was worried about you
And what is this story I hear?
The divorce?
Your dad, your uncle and Safiya
The story that people are talking about
These are all rumors, don't believe them
No specific reason.
They just didn't get along, that all
No, that's not true, I swear they are all lies
I swear by your life
That's what I thought too
I knew Safiya could never do such a thing
She didn't seem like the type that would do that
What did the doctor tell you?
You need a change, take a vacation somewhere
Me?
No, I have to stay here, I have work
But you must call me everyday
Okay, Mostafa, good-bye
Why does he care about her so much?
What does he care if she was having an affair or not?
Does Mostafa love me?
Or do I love Mostafa?
No, this is not love
Maybe I am just fooling around or maybe I was just..
imitating and defying my stepmother
But could it be that I took revenge on Aunt Safiya out of jealousy over Mostafa?
or maybe over my father?
Why couldn't the motive be my love and jealousy for my father?
My father who was all mine and was taken away by another woman
The house is all mine now, I am the mistress here
I am on top now
Father came back to me..
I alone carry his name
He comes home only to me again
I ruined Aunt Safiya but alongside, I ruined everything
Our home, my father even I felt ruined
Oh, God, I fear Your wisdom and I fear Your revenge
Yes, surely God will take revenge on me
I ask for Your forgiveness
I ask that You have mercy on me
Hey!
Watch it!
Nadia Lotfy?
!
- Kawthar!
- How are you, Nadia?
How are you?
No one has seen you since school days
- Dad, my friend Kawthar
- How do you do?
Why don't you come sit with us?
I will wait for you under the umbrella
Come
- Tell me about your news
- In only 6 words
I got married then got divorced
And you?
Did you marry your cousin, Medhat?
Not at all
You made me ditch him then you left him?
You still remember?
That was kids' play
- Is that your dad?
- Yes
He's young and nice and loveable
- He is so kind
- Then why did he divorce twice?
- Just bad luck
- He must be old-fashioned
No, if you mingle with him, you'll find him very cool
Come and I'll introduce you
Hello
Dad, Kawthar was the prettiest girl at school
- You were always prettier, Nadia
- No, you were
OK, then you were the prettiest brunette and I the prettiest blonde
Black and white, then?
How enchanting!
Kawthar says you look young
- Should I say more?
- Stop embarrassing me
- Come on, tell me
- You are loveable
- Don't you love me?
- I do, a great deal
Kawthar is young since she was your schoolmate
I am not young, Dad!
I am older than Nadia, I am 25
- Really?
- Don't get worked up, I'm 24
Ask Kawthar to spend the day with us tomorrow if she's not busy
I have nothing planned for tomorrow
We are going on a trip, you'll love it
I have to go take a dip, excuse me
- Your friend is really nice
- She's well-mannered and fun
She looks well-bred
She was always kind and loyal
It shows
- Who are those?
- None of your business
- The man is staring at you
- Pretend you don't know me
I am sure that man is crazy over you
Tomorrow he'll be on his knees
We'll have a Cadillac, not this old jalopy
Good luck, darling
Hello
- Where is Nadia?
- On her way
The atmosphere is awesome, so romantic
It seems that you are very romantic
I love romance
Are you from Cairo or Alexandria?
From Cairo
Great, so we'll see you when we get back, come and visit Nadia
Yes, but life is full of worries
What worries you?
Are you married?
- No, divorced
- We are in the same boat!
No, I had only one divorce!
- You are still young
- I am 23 and a half
Never seen a woman blurt out her real age like that
I may be cheating a little bit
You have gotten along already!
You are very lucky to have such a sweet father, Nadia
- You can have him!
- Excuse me
- What do you think of Dad?
- He's really slick
He sneaks his way into your heart
Give him a break!
He's so kind!
I wish he'd marry you
As if you were his mother, looking for a bride for him!
I am the only woman in his life so far
So, do you want to be his mother, daughter, or wife?
I can't be his mother or his daughter of course
Come on
Let's go
She wants to marry my father but does she love him?
Maybe
Who cares?
All that matters is that Dad will be happy
Maybe I can redeem myself of my crime
I miss you, Mostafa, I was so busy
Dad is okay, thanks
Ever since he met Kawthar he's become very happy
Everyday, parties, outings, and presents
Won't you come for a few days?
You'll go to the farm in this heat?
Okay..
Good-bye, Mostafa
- Good morning, Dad
- Good morning, Nadia
- You are up early
- Isn't Kawthar here yet?
No, not yet
Do you know that she likes you?
You really make a charming couple, but this time..
- The third one always sticks
- Will you have a wedding?
We will have a big celebration the day you get married, dear
We'll just have a small reception at the hotel and then return to Cairo
May God bless
- Yes?
- Apdou wants his salary
I can't be bothered with salary or celery!
Go to Nadia, I don't care about these things
- Bless you Lady Safiya
- What are you mumbling?
The master will never find a better wife, God damn the culprits!
We will never hear the end of this, will we?
Kawthar is Safiya's equal, maybe even better!
- Good morning
- Good morning
Still no answer
- Tell me, sweetie
- Hello, love
Did I lose or gain weight during the honeymoon?
I can't tell if you gained weight or not
All I can see is that you've become very gorgeous!
Remember, we were going to Europe for our honeymoon?
You didn't want to, put if you insist, let's go
How much money did I save you?
A good sum
Then get me the car you promised me
We already have two cars here
No, I want my own car
As you wish, my darling
Answer, stop being so rude!
Ever since we came pack from Alex, everyday he calls 2 or 3 times
How rude!
Hello, good morning, Mom!
How are you?
I miss you so much
Ahmed?
He's good.
Mom says hello
Invite her over for lunch
Listen, I won't go to work today
Let's spend the day together
No, I don't think so, Ahmed is busy
He won't be able to come with me
Why, Mom?
You were okay, yesterday
I'll try to come but I won't stay for long, just come for a little while
No, it's a whole bottle of whiskey, don't be late
Good bye, dear
Mom is sick and wants us to visit her
Darling, you know I have to go to the farm with the lawyer to close the deal and sell it
You wouldn't go yesterday, she'll be disappointed
You go, and next week we'll spend a whole day with her
Okay
I'll try to come put I won't stay for long, just for a little while
No, it's a whole bottle of whiskey, don't be late
I drove the loyal wife away from his life and put a cheat in her place
I sold out the innocent woman to buy a criminal instead!
God, has Your revenge started to take effect?
Oh, God, O Mighty Avenger
Please forgive me
I can't handle your music or philosophy today!
What is eating at you?
You have changed, you are not like you used to be
We haven't seen each other for ages and you didn't even call!
If I hadn't called you today, you still wouldn't have called
I was very busy these days
Do you still love me, Mostafa?
Sometimes you ask the most awkward questions
Listen up, dear
I like what I see in you and you like what you see in me but there are things in you I can't see,
I don't know if I like them or not
I knew it!
Knew what?
Sometimes I feel we are so far apart
That way you'll miss me more
I have to go
Call me
What is this?
Only 15 pounds?
Your husband is getting very stingy
Have mercy!
He just bought me an expensive car last week
Tell him to give you a little more
Time has passed really quickly
- Do you know what time it is?
- Around one o' clock
- It's 2:15
- Oh, goodness!
It's 2:15 and she isn't back yet, didn't she say where she was going?
I called her mother and she said she left at ten
I think she said she'll go see the doctor
What's wrong with her?
- She was OK when I left
- I don't know
Don't you know who the doctor is so I can ask about her?
- No
- How strange!
I have the power to crush her, to kick her out of the house
But will my Dad take another blow?
Can a man's pride take so many insults?
Dad asked your mom about you and she said you left at ten
If he asks you, say you were at the doctor's
- Which doctor?
- Any doctor
Thanks, Nadia
Where were you till now?
I was worried about you!
- I won't tell you
- I know, you were at the doctor's
I asked her not to tell you
Tell me what?
Really?
Nadia, have them serve lunch, I am starving!
Okay
No, no, no
One step at a time
- How can I thank you?
- For what?
The doctor story, you made up and perfected in an instant!
I didn't do that for your sake
- For whose sake then?
- My poor dad's sake
I know you are having an affair, the phone calls and visits but I can't ruin Dad's life once more
Listen here, you know that your dad loves me and that he is happy with me
Now, that's enough for him
You are right, it's all my fault
He won't take another shock in his life that's why I have to keep quiet
What's wrong, girls?
I am worried about Nadia these days
She's always home, she never goes to visit anyone
Why so, Nadia?
You should take care of yourself
I'll see to it that she goes out
Book us a table tomorrow at the Auberge, for Nadia's sake
How kind you are, dear!
Two ice creams, please
- Hello, Samir
- Hello
Have you met Nadia?
Kawthar is always raving about your beauty
But I didn't think you were this pretty
Is this why you brought me here?
Ice cream?
How innocent!
- What about a martini?
- Would you like a martini?
- No
- It's a great appetizer
- Won't we leave?
- Let's sit with Samir a while
Dad!
Why are you here?
You said you'd go to the hairdresser
We finished early so we said we sit here for a while
- This is Samir
- How do you do?
- I'll tell you later
- Tell me what?
Kawthar will tell you all about it later
I wanted to meet you a few days back but I thought I'd leave it to Nadia
She and Kawthar would choose the right time
Here is definitely not the right time or place
We can't talk about anything now
Let's go and hope everything turns out for the best
Come on, Nadia
Nice to meet you, bye
Where did you meet him?
- In Alex
- On the beach?
Yes, he asked to propose but I thought I'd introduce him to Kawthar and she'd tell you
Is he related to Hossam Pacha, the cotton merchant in Alex?
I think he said he was his father
They are from a big family but they lost all their money.
What does he do?
I think in an insurance company, right, Nadia?
Yes
I will ask around, and since you love him, Nadia, the only thing I can demand is decency money was never important
Listen, you got me into this mess, so get me out!
Do you understand?
Why not marry Samir?
He isn't that bad
He is a cute young man, his father was a pacha
He's poor but that doesn't matter
Your father is rich and can support you
- Are you joking?
- I am dead serious
You can always come and live with us in your uncle's old apartment
So that your husband and lover are under the same roof?
Be a sport
You'll fall in love with him, eventually, he is charming
I am warning you, Kawthar, if you're trying to mess up my life for your love life, forget it!
I'll tear this house down on all of us!
- Here you go
- Thanks, I never drink
- Cigarette?
- I don't smoke
What I care about is your ethics and my daughter's happiness
I asked about you in the company you work for but as I told you..
come, Nadia
She is so shy, she's still young
- Why did you run away?
- Congratulations
- On what?
- I approved
- To what?
- To Samir
- I don't understand
- You are overdoing it
Overdoing what?
Samir proposed and I agreed
He was so embarrassed, and I felt even more embarrassed
- Who said I wanted to marry?
- Kawthar told me all
- I don't want to marry
- What?
So you just wanted to have a boyfriend?
You met him and you had no intention of marriage?
Shouldn't we wait till we ask about him?
And would I have agreed without asking about him?
All my friends at the club said he is from a good family and his manager says he is..
But we should wait till we make sure, right?
I see no reason to delay things
You have always been hesitant in marriage
Listen to me, Nadia dear
People have proposed to you ever since you were sixteen and every time, you would say no
I won't let you ruin your life like that
- Are you sick of me?
- I can't live without you
I will ask Samir that you live here with us
Please, do that, Ahmed
He is a well-educated young man, he's kind, and you are in love with him
Money is not important, we have enough to go around
I don't love him, Daddy
What is this nonsense?
You chose him, not me
Leave her for now, we all did that
Let's expedite the marriage process
I thought once that I was an evil person but God sent me more evil person
The plot is now clear
Marrying me would guarantee Samir a luxurious life and at the same time he would be close to Kawthar
Poor Dad!
Samir was going to take his daughter, his wife and his money!
Dear God, is this Your revenge?
I don't want any mess-ups tonight
- Don't worry, sir
- Good morning, Nadia
- Good morning
- Hello, bride
You look like you didn't sleep all night
Who would get any sleep on a night like this?
Nadia has always been a good, sensible girl
But it's not just a matter of getting married
You must love your husband and be faithful to him
See how much I love Kawthar?
I never imagined falling in love like this
You should take her as your role model for her love and loyalty
I'll go invite our friends and I'll reconfirm with the Maazoun
Listen, this marriage is not happening, understand?
Why not?
Samir is a good guy
Good for you
He had better not come tonight, because I won't marry him
I hate him and despise him
So what?
I was in love with Medhat when we were in school and I never married him
I married another man I didn't even know
I love Samir and didn't marry him and I married your father although I don't love him
Love is something, and marriage is another thing
How unethical!
I will not marry him, and come what may!
Do what you want
I have a message for Daddy
I am having lunch with Samir in his apartment
If he likes it, so be it if he objects, he can divorce me
I had to choose between my Dad's happiness and mine
His life and mine
There was no other way
Maybe it was my fault, because I condoned Kawthar's infidelity
But could I have exposed her?
I would only ruin our lives once again
I covered up for her infidelity to protect my father
So why is God taking revenge on me?
Is covering up a sin a crime that deserves such a punishment?
But was this my only crime?
Oh, God, have mercy on me, save me
Who do I go to?
Who can I consult?
If I had a brother or sister, if only my mother understood me, or if I had a friend
Is Mostafa there?
Isn't this 28107?
He moved?
Don't you know his new address?
Thank you
Are you sure of the affair between Kawthar and Samir?
I fear it may be a rumor
If I knew he'd believe me, I wouldn't hesitate in telling him
I know you worry about him but I'd rather he hurt for a while than live his life a fool!
You have to tell him, Nadia
Admit everything, save yourself and save him
Tell him
Maybe he'll wake up and regret what he's done to Safiya
Safiya!
Be sure that she is innocent and honest, she loved him, he'll never find anyone like her
I am sure, very sure
Hello, Nadia
What a beautiful surprise!
Please come in, dear
I missed you
How are you all?
How is Nanny Halima and Apdou?
All are well
I was thinking of you, I wanted to call you but you know how things are
What is wrong?
I have come to beg something of you
Yes, dear
Excuse me, Nadia
I suppose you remember Nadia Lotfy
Hello, Miss Nadia
Mostafa, my fiancé
Congratulations
- Congratulations, sir
- Sit
Excuse me, I'm very late
God, this is Your will, Your revenge
I'll endure it, then
Hello
- Peace to you all
- Welcome
A blessed marriage, God willing
Please
Many happy returns
Peace on you
May I speak to Nadia?
I don't know what brings him here
- Who?
- Your uncle
My uncle has always loved me
He'd never let such an occasion without coming to see me
Please, Dad, it's only for two hours
Okay, hurry because everyone is waiting
- Congratulations, Samir
- Thank you
I want you for a second, come
I am sorry to keep you
I want your opinion in a legal issue
- I am not a lawyer
- But you have experiences
It is a really serious issue
If someone is caught having an affair with a married woman do you know what sentence he gets?
I have no idea
A short time in prison
I think it's around three years
What's that got to do with me?
Maybe he won't go to jail, you know why?
Maybe he'll get killed by the husband before he gets sentenced
But that has got nothing to do with me
Don't you feel that you are playing the fool till the end?
End of what?
Do you think that your affair with Kawthar is a secret?
Kawthar?
Listen here, don't waste time
You still have a chance to escape!
One word from Nadia will send you to hell
This is nonsense
I heard you talking to Kawthar with my own ears
Where was that?
She recorded your sweet voices on the phone
about your little love nest and the red hot nights you spend together
Think quickly
Don't forget this
If Nadia doesn't speak up, I will
Congratulations, Nadia
Congratulations, Nadia
She is so pretty
I ask God for forgiveness the only God the Almighty
We regret our sins and ask for forgiveness
and salvation from hell
Let's pray that this marriage be - a happy, blessed marriage
and that God grant the couple good, pious children
Let's pray
Amen
Give me your hand
In the name of God, the Beneficent the Merciful
Say after me
I wed my daughter, Nadia Lotfy, to you according to the teaching of Apu Hanifa and as per the dowry we have agreed to
I accept the marriage
No, no, I don't want him, Dad
Nadia!
What is it?
What happened?
I will never marry him, it's impossible!
Just tell me what's going on
I will tell you everything
- Samir is Kawthar's lover
- Shut up!
Unfortunately, it is true
You've caused enough damage!
He didn't do anything, I will tell you everything
What is between Kawthar and Samir?
I'll tell you, I have taped their phone calls
I have all the proof you need
Who told her uncle?
Probably her, we can still run
I will never leave this place
We're cornered, her uncle told me that Nadia has material evidence
Even so!
Are you crazy!
It is a criminal offense!
Come with me
Is there any where we can run away from?
I am sorry, Nadia is ill, we'll postpone the marriage
We apologies
You wait here
Won't we walk the bride out of the house?
Call Nanny Halima for me
- They ran away
- Impossible
- That's broof of their crime
- The bastard!
Nadia!
Aunt Safiya is innocent, Dad and my uncle is, too
I was jealous of her, and God took revenge
Call the hospital right away!
Nadia!
Nadia!
- How is she today?
- A lot better
Will the burns leave scars?
Unfortunately, her body has been maimed
Can't plastic surgery help?
I don't think so
- Thanks
- You are welcome
Nadia, the doctor put me at ease
Did he tell you everything?
Did he tell you my body's maimed?
Did he tell you I will live...
Be thankful that God saved you
Saved me to torture me
- I did you wrong
- We forgive you
God doesn't forgive me
God is the Most Merciful
I deserve no mercy
- Forget the past, dear
- We are all back together
We can turn a new leaf, Nadia
Please, God, don't lead me to temptation and don't let me sin and don't let the evil in me triumph over goodness
Oh, God
~ The river's edge ~

- Well, you picked a hot day, mister.
- I always do.
- Fill her up, will ya?
- You bet.
Mighty nice transportation you got here.
- I'll sell it to you.
- No, thanks.
- Gonna do a little hunting'?
- Well, I hope to.
You know a guy around here named Cameron
- Ben Cameron?
Sure, I know Ben.
If you need a guide, he's your man.
He knows this country like the palm of his hand.
That's what I hear.
How far is his place?
Oh, about 22 miles straight ahead.
Then you take the left fork.
I don't know whether Ben's taking on any new hunters right now though.
Got himself a new wife.
He stays, uh, pretty close to home these days.
Well, can't say I blame him.
Is she a nice girl?
- Awful nice girl.
Pretty as a picture.
City girl.
- Uh-huh.
Kind of a redhead, about, oh- about 5 foot 3?
Yeah, that's right.
Say, you must know her.
They got married up in San Francisco, right after Ben got back from Korea.
Excuse me.
Well, that does her.
That'll be 9.42.
I have to haul the stuff.
It kind of ups the price a little bit.
Here's 10.
What sort of place does he run?
Well, it ain't much right now, but Ben'll have her working before he's through.
- He runs 25- maybe 30 head of cattle.
- Uh-huh.
Straight down the road.
Ben, look out!
Stay where you are!
Ben, are you all right?
Did he gore you?
Nah, he just stomped on me a little.
- Son of a gun is real happy about it, isn't he?
- Let me see.
Look, I'm okay.
It's just a bruise.
It happens all the time on a ranch.
- Ben!
- Don't get so excited about it.
I got to brand this fella.
Isn't
- Isn't there some other way you can do that besides burning them?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I
- I could tie a letter to his tail that said he was mine.
Meg, you don't have to run out here every time I get mixed up with a cow.
That bull might've hurt you!
All right, Ben.
Ooh!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben, come in here right now!
Ben, come right in here!
- Wait-Wait a minute.
Here.
It's simple.
- Ben!
Just shut it off!
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!
That's all.
I told you not to use it.
I told you I had to clean out the water tank.
If I listened to every stupid story you told me, I'd go crazy!
- Don't get sore at me.
It's your own fault.
- Where's my towel?
You just won't listen!
I bet you will from now on.
- I'll bet you don't know what'll happen from now on.
Oh, get out of here!
Go on.
Get out!
All right.
All right.
Look, but that stuff dries fast in this climate.
You don't hurry up, you'll need a whisk broom instead of a towel.
- Leave me alone!
- All right.
Honey, what'd you do with that calf medicine I had in the cabinet?
- What calf medicine?
- The only calf medicine I had.
It was right here in a tin can.
You mean that stuff that looked like brown water?
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
It cost 11 bucks!
Well, how did I know it was calf medicine?
What'd you think I had it there for, a keepsake?
Eleven bucks thrown away.
Maybe it'll make the rocks grow.
Well, I didn't do it on purpose, and I'm sorry, and that's all I can say.
And if you're so worried about the money
- You've turned down three jobs this month already.
You bet I did.
I'm gonna turn down the next three too.
Sure, sure!
At a hundred dollars a week.
Meg, I'm not a guide.
I'm a rancher.
Can't you understand that?
This is a cattle ranch.
I mean, it's not much now, but it can be, if I take care of it.
There isn't any fun in our lives, Ben.
There's nothing but work from the time we get up in the morning... until the time we go to bed at night.
There isn't even a bath!
Honey.
Honey, there will be.
Butane is a very explosive gas.
This safety valve is supposed to be closed when using... like I've told you maybe 60 times.
You don't close it, she blows up, and you've got a nice mess to clean up.
I don't have any mess to clean up.
You have.
Eh, that's pretty good.
Wha-What was it?
It was a cake, you big goon.
Or have you forgotten today was your birthday?
I guess I had.
No.
You never think about anything... except those ugly-looking cows, and you never have.
You can start thinking right now where you're gonna find yourself another filly... because this one's jumping the fence.
Aw, come on.
Now, don't talk like that, Meg.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Look, what can I do, huh?
You can get the truck unloaded so you can drive me into town.
And throw in some oats and some hay.
Boy, I sure can pick 'em.
I figured you'd fade in the stretch.
I did think you'd make it around the first turn.
Oh, it isn't that, Ben.
I'm not such a quitter.
Oh, honey, Meg.
What's the matter with us, honey?
We just shouldn't have gotten married in the first place, Ben.
I like it.
Where would you be if I-
- Go ahead.
Finish it.
- Oh.
Where would I be if you hadn't gotten me out of California and married me?
Serving nine more years in the penitentiary for violation of parole.
Meg, forget it.
I've never thrown it at you.
No, but it's always on your mind, isn't it?
You didn't want to marry me.
You were lonesome, you were out of the army... and you thought it was a good caper to get a girl out of a jam by marrying her.
Well, it was a good caper.
It was no way to start a marriage.
Aw, hey.
Come on.
Meg, come on now.
Forget it.
Look, I'm sorry about that calf medicine.
Look, baby.
Come on.
Let's forget the whole thing.
Ben, we can't forget it!
If there was a marriage to fight for, I'd stay here the rest of my life, but there isn't.
There isn't even any love, and you just can't live without that.
There was plenty of love with the other guy, I suppose, huh?
- Yes, I loved him.
- Yeah.
He got you in a jam and ran out on you.
Left you alone to face a 10-year rap!
Even after you got out on parole, he didn't show up, right?
- Yes.
- If that's love, I'll take mine straight!
I bet you still love the guy.
Come on.
Say it.
You're still nuts about him, aren't you?
- I think I hate him.
- But you're not sure, huh?
Oh, Ben, you don't understand.
You don't understand anything.
Once you've loved somebody, you never can be sure.
Even when it's changed to hate, you never know whether it's just the other side of love.
It's the way those things are.
Meg.
Meg, are you- are you goin' back to him?
Oh, I don't even know where he is.
And if I did, I'd never go back to him.
Let's just put it this way, Ben.
One man got me into jail, and another man saved me from going back.
Now it's time I did something on my own, without any help from anyone-just me.
- That's why I'm leaving.
- Meg, please don't go.
- Ben.
- Meg, honest- honestly, I'll try.
What do you want?
- Mr. Cameron?
Ben Cameron?
- Yeah.
My name is Denning.
I've heard a lot about you and-
- Excuse me.
- My wife.
How do you do, Mrs. Cameron?
Just, uh, what is it you want, Mr., uh, Denning?
Well, I wanted to go across the border and do some shooting at Lagos de Zapitan.
Just cross the international bridge at Arivaca.
Hire yourself a guide.
No problem at all.
Well, frankly, I was expecting to come back with a little more than the legal limit.
I don't want to go through customs.
I'd like to go straight through.
And I don't want another guide.
I want you.
Uh-huh.
Well, why me?
Well, they tell me you're the best, and that's what I want.
Across the international border, it's an easy 20 miles.
The only other route is 50 miles of pure up and down.
I'm not interested.
They tell me your fee is a hundred dollars a week.
I'll give you 200.
When my husband says he isn't interested, Mr. Denning, he isn't interested.
You couldn't buy him for a thousand a week, so stop wasting your time.
Will you let me handle this?
There's a lot of good guides in this country.
You won't have any trouble finding one at that price.
Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.
Think it over, Mr. Cameron.
- If you should change your mind, just-
- I won't.
Oh, uh, by the way, my wife is driving to town.
I'm too busy branding to drive her.
How about giving her a lift?
Why, certainly.
I'd be glad to.
Maybe I better wait till this evening, Ben, and let you drive me.
Why wait?
The man's got a nice car, plenty of room in it.
Let me take that.
Good-bye, Mr. Cameron.
Remember, Ben.
This is the way you wanted it.
Yeah.
I'm awful glad to see you, Meg.
- You knew I was here?
- Sure.
I've been hunting for you for quite a while.
I missed you, honey.
I've missed you too, Nardo, ever since the day I was arrested.
You were supposed to come back from Los Angeles that morning.
You never did.
I know.
I started, but I just never got there.
I started the night before.
Then I hit a truck on that straightaway going into Bakersfield.
I didn't come to for five weeks.
I don't believe you.
I can show you the records of the Bakersfield General Hospital, if you like- 14 months of'em.
You're too good on things like that, Nardo.
I wouldn't believe them either.
- Would you believe that?
- Nardo.
Took me six months before I could even write you a letter.
And when I did, it came back "addressee unknown."
I didn't know what had happened till I got back to San Francisco.
By then, you'd been in Tehachapi for almost a year.
So I got ahold of a lawyer.
I gave him some dough to work on your parole.
Then I had to get out of town.
- Where'd you go?
- Chicago.
But when I did make parole, you weren't there.
I know, honey.
I was in New York when the lawyer's letter came.
I got the news two weeks late.
So I caught the first plane to San Francisco, but... you weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.
Where'd you expect me to be?
I know, honey.
I don't blame you.
I just don't want you to blame me too much.
After all, we-we did find each other.
You do believe me, don't you?
I don't know what to believe.
I'm almost afraid to believe anything anymore.
Take me into town, Nardo.
Don't make me cry.
You know how I hate that.
I know, honey.
- Here.
Let me take that.
- I'd rather.
Meg.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
No, I don't think so, Nardo.
I have a lot of thinking to do.
Hello, Mrs. Cameron.
Having a night on the town?
I'd like a single with a bath.
Ben still working?
It's 212.
First room up on your right.
I'll bring your baggage up as soon as I register this gentleman.
- I'd like a bath too.
- Oh.
When you take up the lady's bag, take up a nice jar of bubble bath too, will you?
Yes, sir.
- Sandalwood, if you got it.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
~ You'll never know just how much ~
~ I miss you ~
~ You'll never know Just how much ~
~ I care ~
~ And if I tried ~
~ I still couldn't hide ~
~ My love for you ~
~ You ought to know ~
~ For haven't I told you so ~
~ A million or more times ~
~ You went away ~
~ And my heart ~
~ Went with you ~
~ I speak your name ~
~ In my every breath ~~
- You remember this song?
- Yes.
And this dress-Where?
Peacock Room, Palace Hotel, San Francisco.
We decided to become a team.
Ah, you do remember.
And what a team.
Best in the business.
- Why weren't we ever honest?
- What do you mean, honest?
We only took the people who could afford it.
We only took those who thought they could take us.
Nothing dishonest about that.
Remember that wildcatter in Dallas?
Boy, what a killing.
You bought me a mink coat and a diamond clip.
Yeah.
Oh, those were the days.
I hocked them when we went broke in Paris.
We weren't a very lucky team, were we?
Well, I don't say we didn't have a couple of hard times once in a while, but-
Listen, honey.
Let's sit down and have a drink.
Okay?
Right over there.
- Hiya, Barry.
- Well, hello, Ben.
I'm glad you dropped in.
That section of land next to yours is open now, if you want it.
I came to sell you my place.
Still want to buy it?
You didn't seem to think my price was right.
Well, I changed my mind.
- One old-fashioned with scotch and a brandy and soda.
Honey, I've got something big this time- bigger than you can imagine.
No, Nardo, I'm all through with that sort of thing.
Just count me out.
But, honey, don't get me wrong.
We've got enough to last us for the rest of our lives- one million dollars.
It's what I've always wanted.
And when I got it, I came for you.
How did you get it?
Look, sweetheart.
It was knowing about my deals that got you that jail term.
I don't want it to happen again.
Nobody can ever harm you for something you don't know.
But this is all wrapped up.
It's okay, it's safe and it's clean.
- And the police are after you.
- No, no.
That's the beauty of it.
Nobody's after me.
The police are after a bundle of money, but they don't know who's got it.
No description, no photograph, no nothing.
Just a big bundle of beautiful bills with Ben Franklin's picture on 'em.
That's why you wanted Ben to take you across the border- so you could get away with it, huh?
Well, Ben or anybody else.
I wanted Ben because I wanted his wife.
But for the money I'm willing to pay, we can hire another guide.
- We?
- Who else?
It was always "we."
Always will be.
Come on.
Drink your drink.
We'll make a fresh start, honey.
- Your dinner's ready, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, honeybunch, let's drink up, and tell me what's bothering you, huh?
It's Ben.
You mean that farmer?
I thought you were walking out on him anyhow.
Well, I did, but I'm not sure I should have.
You know, if it weren't for Ben, you know where I'd be now.
But why worry about it, honey?
You don't love the guy.
No, but I like him.
That's pretty important.
What about me?
I guess I love you, Nardo.
I've tried not to.
I
- I thought I was all over it, but I-
I guess I was wrong.
The minute I saw your face, it all came back to me.
Well, you're like something I've caught... and can't quite cure myself of.
I'll get another guide to take us across.
We'll be out of here before morning.
No, we've got to see Ben first-you and I.
Okay.
I don't relish the prospect... but if that's what you want, that's the way it's going to be.
Let's go now and get it over.
- Hi, Fred.
- Hi, Ben.
- Can I look at that?
- Sure.
212, huh?
She ain't up there, Ben.
Where is she?
She left a couple of minutes ago.
- With a guy in a sports car?
- Yeah.
That's right, Ben.
Well
- Gives me a chance to do a little drinking, huh?
Right, Ben.
- What'd I do wrong, Officer?
- Nothing, I hope.
Can I see your registration certificate?
I know I didn't run through a stoplight.
Was I going too fast?
Can I see your registration certificate?
Well, if I've broken some traffic law, I'm sorry.
If you won't tell me what I did, just write out the ticket, and let's get it over with.
Well, I'm not police.
I'm border patrol.
- Border patrol.
This far from the border?
- That's right, sir.
Nine miles.
We cover back as far as 20 miles.
At 10 miles, we have quite a few spot checks.
- May I take a look in the trunk?
- The trunk?
Sure.
Right back here.
Do you have the key?
Look, Officer.
It's kind of late, and the lady's married.
I got to get her back home fast.
Can't you sort of forget that you ever saw us?
This is the only service I know of that's absolutely free.
You have no right to search my car without a warrant.
Now, look, mister.
We're looking for something special.
We're covering the border from Brownsville to Tijuana.
Now get that key and get it fast.
Here.
What's the matter?
The border patrol won't give you any trouble.
They're always very nice.
Why didn't you want him to look in the trunk?
He wants me to pull up a little.
Nardo!
Nardo, what have you done?
Meg.
- Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
- Meg, what's wrong with you?
Meg, what's wrong with you?
I was only trying to stop you, honey.
- I thought you were trying to kill me.
- Oh, Meg, sweetheart.
I thought you killed him- I mean, deliberately.
I didn't know the gear was in reverse.
- I promise you I didn't!
- Oh, I know.
Come on.
- Feel better, honey?
- Yes, thanks.
Looks like we'll have to walk.
The rocks have busted the gas tank.
Lee, it's five minutes to 3:00.
Will you put out a missing person's alarm?
Look, Ben.
- You'll only make a fool out of yourself.
She'll show up.
I've been through this before.
You think you're the only guy whose wife steps out on him?
- That isn't funny, Lee.
- Oh, look.
It happens all the time.
Something might've happened to her.
Sheriff, give us a hand here!
- It's Harry Castleton.
- I found him on 26.
Guy... ran over me... twice.
Had a
- Had a... redhead... with him... in a... pink sports car.
On
- On purpose.
Go on, Harry.
Talk!
He can't talk.
He's dead.
Meg!
Meg!
Open the door.
Meg!
He's simply got to take us across now.
We don't dare get another guide.
Meg, open the door!
And another thing.
You never saw me before in your whole life, okay?
- Okay.
- Meg, open the door!
I should've known you'd be with him.
- Get out of here!
- I can't.
My car's bogged down.
You've got a lot more than a car to worry about.
The man you killed has four kids.
That was an accident.
She was there.
She'll tell you.
Get some decent clothes on.
I'm taking you into Arivaca.
- What for?
- So you can tell 'em what you know about this mess.
I can't do that, Ben.
She's right, Cameron.
It was only hit-and-run, but she's an accessory.
Her fingerprints are all over that car, and there's a good chance they're on the body too.
You've got to take us across the border into Mexico.
All she has to do is tell the truth.
I told you to get dressed.
- I won't go, Ben.
I won't!
- Then you'll go as you are.
- No, Ben.
No!
Please let me go!
- Come on.
- No!
Let me go, Ben!
Ben, I'm-
- Cameron!
- Go on and shoot!
You haven't the guts.
- I don't need guts.
I need you.
- You're on your way, baby.
- No, I can't go.
You know I can't!
- Shut up!
- Ben, when I get back there, they'll check on me.
They'll find out I've broken my parole, and I'll spend the next nine years in the penitentiary.
- Can't you learn to keep your mouth shut?
- So that's the way it is.
The lady generates a little heat.
I wondered why you married him.
Now I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Boy- You two really deserve each other.
- You gonna take us or not?
- Ben, you've got to.
How much would you say she was worth?
Well, I offered you $200 before, and you turned it down.
That was before you killed Harry Castleton.
A thousand.
That may be all your stinking carcass is worth.
Look.
What about hers?
Well, you would know more about that than I would.
5,000 for the whole deal.
Nah.
I'd say about, uh, 10.
Ben, I'll go to jail if you don't.
Will ya listen?
She's in it all the way, Cameron.
You wouldn't expect me to put a higher value on your wife than you would yourself.
Don't play around with me, Denning.
I'll turn you both over to the cops.
I believe you would.
- All right. 10,000.
- Cash on the line?
I don't know whether I can trust you.
You might decide to turn me over on this side of the border.
You've got the gun.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Ben, I
- I'm sorry.
Shut up.
I picked a tramp, and I know it.
I wouldn't let a dog spend nine years in jail if I could help it.
Especially for 10,000 bucks.
Oh, look, it's dangerous handling that amount of money.
I'd rather you'd carry it.
I got a feeling I can trust you.
- Uh, you can keep her too.
- I'm gonna take you up on that.
- When do we leave?
- Right now.
You got three minutes to get dressed, pack some grub and join us.
What's in the bag?
Change of underwear.
You must have problems.
Where do you think you're going?
I think I'll ride in the truck with you.
You and Meg are riding in here.
I'm driving the rig.
I don't think so.
I'd rather ride alongside of you.
Look, Mac.
Let's understand each other.
From now on, you do exactly what I tell you to do, and you'll do it on the double.
Because when you stop taking orders, I stop moving.
When I stop moving, you're a gone goose.
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I think it does.
In the trailer.
When the motor starts, turn the lights off.
And keep 'em off.
Here.
You two get some sleep.
I know I can trust you together.
What's, uh-What's that?
Hay?
In case you're interested, your wife's behavior with me tonight has been impeccable.
I'm, uh
- I'm just a farmer, Denning.
I don't know what that word "impeccable" means.
If it means what it sounds like, uh, congratulations.
Any chance of him double-crossing us?
No.
He isn't as experienced at double-crossing as you and I.
He never made a living at it.
Whatever he says he'll do, you can count on it.
He almost made a square out of you, sweetheart.
A slug in my head right now would send 30,000 volts through yours.
Denning-
Don't jump.
Don't move.
You might get hurt.
- Don't lift your head.
You'll get an ugly scratch if you do.
What's the beef, Cameron?
- You ever see a knife like this before?
- No, I don't think I have.
We use 'em to stick turkeys with.
She slides in at the base of the throat, moves straight up into the brain.
It's like peeling a banana.
I've done it a million times.
I hope the novelty's worn off by now.
There are gonna be lots of times on this trip when we won't be able to watch each other... like when we're asleep.
I don't like anybody holding a gun on me while I'm driving.
Okay.
You've made your point.
Or any other time!
If that ever happens again, Denning-
From now on, we walk.
Most of the time, straight up.
I'm dumping the trailer and truck over the cliff.
You grab a pack.
Get your stuff together.
Don't take any more than you can carry.
I'm awful sensitive about packing stuff that isn't mine.
- Cameron-
- Yeah?
- Are you sure we can't take this rig any further?
- Yeah.
What if we have to turn back?
If we have to turn back, your buddy'll have more than transportation to worry about.
We'd still have the truck and trailer.
I'm not leaving any road signs behind me.
By the time she hits the bottom of that canyon, she'll be in so many pieces... they won't be able to spot 'em from an airplane.
If there's any danger of the border police getting on our trail, I think we ought to-
I got news for you, Mac.
They're already on our trail.
But can't we at least hide the truck in case we need it later?
If we ever get in a spot where you need this truck to pull you out... you'll be a dead duck anyhow.
You get out on the point and watch her splatter.
Better toss over that case too.
You're not gonna have time to change underwear on this trip.
You just take care of your end.
I'll take care of mine.
You never liked it anyway.
Come on.
It'll take four or five hours to get around this cliff.
We don't have enough daylight.
We'll stay here and wait till morning.
What in tarnation you folks doin' way up here?
Hiya, pop.
Ben Cameron!
- Hiya, Ben.
- Hi.
Hiya, Ms. Cameron.
Phew.
What do you figure doin' up here, son?
Jumpin' my claim?
- No.
I'm just taking this dude hunting.
- Huntin'?
Where's your gun?
Well, we don't need 'em.
- We're
- We're gonna scare the game to death.
- Having a little trouble though.
- Uh-huh.
What's your problem?
Well, we could save time if we had a rope.
- A rope?
- Yeah, to get these two up there.
Well, time's kind of cheap, but, uh, ropes come pretty dear iffen you ain't got one.
- How much?
- How about two dollars?
- I'll give you five.
- Good Lord.
For five, I'll carry you up piggyback.
You wait right here!
There's a rock up there- I used to could hit it first try.
Here, here.
Let me do it.
That's pretty good, boy.
Couldn't have done it much better myself.
I'll do the hauling.
You tie 'em on down here, huh?
Okay, son.
All right, Denning, you go first.
Hey, pop.
Tie the dude on, will ya?
Okay.
Sure hope this holds.
Do you, uh, got that five dollars handy?
Here.
Denning, you just hold on.
I'll pull.
Uh, you just use your feet as much as you can.
Let me down, Cameron!
Wow!
Oh, wow!
Let me down!
Hey!
That's-That's nice underwear you've got.
Man, that's a crazy color.
This is what I've been lookin' for all my life.
I'd sure like to know where your claim is, mister.
- This even feels good!
- I'll take care of it.
- No, no.
Don't mind at all.
Don't mind to help.
- Just take it easy, pop.
I'd like to have this job by the week.
Maybe you will.
Say, uh, where is that claim of yours?
Right over here.
Come on.
I'd like to show it to you.
Take care of this, Meg.
There she be!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You got to play it the way the cards fall.
He'd have told half the state.
- Bury him.
- You're crazy.
Bury him!
Here's your wire from Washington, Captain.
Well, that ought to tie it up, especially with this fingerprint report.
"The prints on Harry Castleton's belt belong to a woman named Margaret Fowler.
"She drew a one-to-10-year rap in Tehachapi for a bunco job.
Out on parole after serving one year."
And her fingerprints match up just fine with Ben Cameron's wife.
You don't think Ben's mixed up in this, do you?
The dame's messed up in it bad.
That dress was found in their cabin.
As for Ben, why not?
He sold his place and moved out the night of the murder.
Ben was with me when Harry Castleton was brought in.
So Cameron helps his wife out of a jam.
After her two-timing him with that fancy Dan?
That's the kind of a guy Ben is.
Yeah, it figures, all right.
If I know Ben, and I think I do, I know just where he's gonna try to cross over.
- Which way?
- The right.
- Why don't you take the lead?
- If I'm gonna be shot, I want to see it comin'.
Go ahead.
You, uh- You a music lover, Denning?
No, but I'm a sucker for police broadcasts.
I'll give you two about an hour.
- For what?
- To rest.
Then we start out again.
You mean we're gonna travel tonight?
All night.
Aren't you pushing things a little hard, Cameron?
Your wife's kind of tired.
You can carry her pack.
We have all day tomorrow for sleeping.
I can walk right alongside of you night and day, Cameron.
I'd just like to know the reason why.
We have to cross the upper end of the Papago Reservation.
If we try it by daylight, we'll be spotted.
We have to make it tonight.
Sounds reasonable.
Just how far are we from the border?
Too far.
I'm gonna take a look for the best way down.
I'll be back.
I'm sorry about what happened back there with the old man, honey.
I had to do it.
He'd have talked.
You know that, don't you?
- Sure.
He'd have talked.
- And that would've been the end of it.
They'd have picked us up in 24 hours.
You'd have gone back to jail.
Me too.
We might never have gotten together again.
- So we had to kill him.
- Sure.
And the man we ran over- It wasn't an accident, was it?
- We had to kill him too, didn't we?
- Now, look here, sweetheart.
The first thing they teach you in the Marine Corps is to cover yourself.
You come first.
It's got to be that way.
You make it sound like a virtue... as if it were our Christian duty to kill anyone that gets in our way.
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get this "our" business?
You had nothing to do with it.
We're a team, aren't we?
It's never been you or me.
It's always been us.
And it always will be us.
Don't think of the past, sweetheart.
Think of the future.
Think of us together... once we get rid of that husband of yours.
- What do you mean, get rid of him?
- Wait a minute, honey.
I'm no gun-crazy killer.
I don't go out looking for trouble.
I've got nothing against Cameron.
As far as I can see, I never should have.
But you said "get rid of him."
I meant when we get across the border.
I'll pay him off, I'll tell him about us... and that's all there'll be to it.
Nardo, get the $10,000.
Put it on his pack so he'll find it when he gets back.
- What does that get us?
- It'll get us out of here.
We don't need him anymore.
- You mean, we're already across the border?
- No, but we're very close to it.
How close?
- Remember what Ben said about the Papago Reservation?
- Yeah.
Well, we've been there- Ben and I.
It's a long, narrow valley dotted with little Indian farms.
The border's just the other side of it- down there.
- How far would you guess?
- Five miles.
Maybe less.
Then we don't need Ben.
We can make it alone.
After you've put the money on the pack.
Let's go, honey.
This is something we waited for for three years.
Listen.
We've never quite been able to get away from San Francisco, have we?
I don't want to get away from it- not that part of it.
I want to get away from the rest of it.
Honey, we're all through taking the suckers.
We're all through scrounging for money.
From now on, it's gonna be just you... and me.
Get what you need.
Let's get off the road.
Get gun.
Help!
Help, somebody!
Help!
- What's the matter with you?
What are you trying to do to me?
Don't get scared, son.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Nice cow.
You pay.
Drop the gun, Denning.
Pick it up.
Give it to me.
- Pay the boy for the cow.
- How much?
Five of those bills you got in your pocket.
- $500?
- Yeah.
We were hunting out on the reservation by mistake.
- You won't tell, huh?
- No.
Here's your gun.
We won't cause you any more trouble.
Let's go back and pick up the gear you left.
Why don't we go on across the border?
I'll be on my way.
How close to the border you think we are?
I thought about five miles.
Five miles?
Why do you look at her?
Is that what she told you?
How would she know?
She's never been here before.
We've got a good two days' hike to cross over.
Why'd you do it, Meg?
Because something's happened to you, Nardo.
Something terrible.
I thought the first one was an accident.
But now I know it wasn't.
- You're a killer.
- That still makes us a team.
I do my own killing.
You want a judge to do yours.
Ben, I
- I should have told you this before.
- This is-
- I know who he is.
She kept your picture.
She was pretty crazy about you.
- I guess she still is.
- Yeah, sure.
Just hope she doesn't get that crazy about you, Cameron.
Because you'll watch her the rest of your life.
What they've done once, they'll do again.
Let's get going.
Okay, we'll stop here.
We can sleep till noon.
You go down there.
We'll stay here.
Here, I'll take that.
Ben?
- Ben.
- Hmm.
Ben, I-
I'm no good, Ben.
I'm no good for anybody.
He still loves me, and I tried to raise the whole countryside so he'd be caught.
Almost did.
I never saw anybody so anxious to get back to the penitentiary.
Why'd you do it?
He wanted to kill you.
Well, we have a lot in common.
I want to kill him.
I'm cured of him, Ben.
Yeah?
Maybe.
There's no maybe about it.
When your blood turns cold and you can't bear the thought of him touching you, you're cured.
Let's leave here, Ben.
Let's leave here and go back to home.
It's not that easy.
You're mixed up in two murders.
There'd be too much explaining.
Besides, I want to be around when Denning dies.
Ben-
That's the way it is.
You mean you'd kill him?
Look.
I've got a rifle wrapped up in this blanket.
Do you know why?
If I didn't, I'd kill him a hundred times a day.
Not for the money?
No, not- not just for the money.
If the money's there, I'm not gonna walk away from it.
How's your arm?
It's swelling a little.
It hurts.
It's bound to.
Go on.
Go and get some sleep.
- What's the matter, Meg?
- My arm.
Too painful!
Honey
- Honey, you have a fever.
- Why didn't you tell me, huh?
- I didn't know.
Come on.
We'll find shelter in that cave.
Can you make it?
Sit down.
Here, let me help.
Let me look at that arm.
How is it?
It's
- It's not good.
- Is it
- Is it infected?
- You should have told me.
Everything's soaked.
Hey, don't get too comfortable.
We're gathering wood.
You gather it.
If he makes a wrong move, shoot him.
I got to have something dry to start it with.
Fat chance.
You got anything that might be dry?
It's been raining just as hard on me as it has on you.
All right, Denning.
Give it to me.
- You're crazy.
- I've got to boil some water.
She's got an armful of gangrene.
Give me my 10 grand.
9,500.
You bought a cow, don't forget.
Do you think she'd burn up $ 10,000 on you?
I can't believe you're a natural-born fool.
You must have trained for it.
Here.
Keep your eye on him.
The wood's drier now.
The next batch oughta do it.
All right, Denning, let's- let's have some more.
No.
I'll never have a better excuse for killing you.
That's what you'll have to do.
Don't move.
Meg, the rifle.
I'm afraid I'll miss.
Meg, you won't miss.
I might hit you.
You won't hit me.
Just... cock the hammer... and aim like I taught you.
- Good try.
- Thanks.
And thank you.
Here, baby.
Come on.
Good girl.
Here.
You lie down.
I'll have a fire going in a jiffy.
Come on.
One thing I gotta say for us, we sure got money to burn.
By the way, Denning, where'd you get this stuff, huh?
Oh, a fellow I know left it with me.
He was a little hot, so I held it until he cooled off.
So when he came back, you- you just weren't there, huh?
That's right.
He, uh, didn't know you very well, did he?
Oh, he knew me very well.
He was my best friend.
All right, baby, come on.
Turn over, huh?
Easy.
That's it.
I'm just gonna cut away your sleeve.
Easy.
Easy, baby.
Raise up a little.
That's it.
All right, baby, this is gonna be hot now.
Easy.
Easy, honey.
Easy.
That's it.
That's it.
Now, baby, this is gonna hurt.
Now, you just yell as much as you want, huh?
I know.
I know, baby.
Easy.
That's all, honey.
There.
That's it, baby.
Easy.
Now, easy.
That's it.
That's my girl.
It's all over now, honey.
It's all over, baby.
That's it.
It's all over, baby.
Now the dead flesh is cut away, the pain goes awfully fast.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I had to hurt you, Meg.
What are you so nervous about?
I'm just gonna go out and get some firewood.
You know, if you were on a desert island with that guy... and there was nothing there but rocks... pretty soon he'd have all the rocks moved to his side of the beach.
How do you feel, huh?
- Lots better.
- Sure.
You'll be on your feet by the time this storm peters out.
- Ben.
- Yeah?
If
- If I were to go back to jail, would you wait for me?
Honey, till you're a little old, old lady.
Let's go back to the ranch.
Well, I haven't got a ranch.
I
- I sold it.
- Sold it?
- Yeah, to Floyd Barry.
- Sold it when?
- Night I came to town to pick you up.
But-You-You loved that scraggly old piece of desert.
Nah, I was getting a bellyful of it.
Besides, I figured it was either you or the ranch... and I
- I reckon I liked you best.
Oh, Ben, I-I'm scared.
Ben, l-let's tell him he can have all the money.
Look, honey, we've witnessed two murders.
He's got to try to kill us.
Money isn't the point anymore.
Except that you think you're going to end up with all of it.
I'm not gonna leave it there for the coyotes.
We're all fouled up, honey.
We gotta have money to stay clear.
Not that kind, Ben.
What-What can you do with it, except run for the rest of your life?
Me, honey?
I'd buy you things.
Buy you some new shoes.
I'd buy you 300 pink dresses.
Pardon me.
Maybe I should have knocked.
- How's the weather outside?
- Wet.
I think I'll take a light from your fire.
Hey, that'll cost you 25,000.
A little more than I can afford.
Besides, the storm is clearing up anyway.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking what a fool I am... trying to stay awake to watch you.
You're the one who has to do the watching, not I.
Good night, Cameron.
Too bad you can't join me in pleasant dreams.
Ben, I'm cold.
Is that better?
Look.
It's still raining in San Felipe.
How far away is that storm?
About four miles.
San Felipe's 10 miles south of the border.
Yeah.
That puts me in Mexico right now.
Since, uh, yesterday.
- Meg, come down here.
- Stay there.
You think I won't?
I think you will.
But she stays there.
Get away from him.
Get away from him.
No, Nardo!
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna use any ammunition I might need later on.
What do you think your chances are of getting out of here?
About 60-40... maybe a little less.
A lot less.
You're through, Cameron.
- So are you, if you stay with him.
- Worry about yourself.
I'll be all right.
I don't have an infected arm.
I don't have my leg covered in rocks.
But I do have a gun, so I'll eat.
I can't miss so long as I keep heading' south.
- What do you think?
- Yeah, you stand a pretty good chance.
My chances would be a lot better if you give me some instructions.
I'll do better than give you instructions.
I'll give you a choice.
Down this canyon, about two and a half miles... you come to a road.
It goes to the left.
You follow that road, you'll come to a little...
Indian village called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10... tell them where we are.
They'll come and help us.
You'd do as much for me, I suppose?
That's neither here nor there.
The only trouble with Santa Isabel, it's... in the opposite direction to where you want to go.
That's what I figured.
Your other choice is- when you get to the road, you look to the right.
You'll see the Lagos de Zapitan.
They have an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could- you could be on your way to Mexico City.
I like that better.
Why don't you tell her to come along with me?
She needs a doctor.
No reason for you both to die here... unless you want it that way.
It makes a crazy kind of sense, Meg.
- Better pack your stuff and go with him.
- No.
- We haven't got a 50-to-1 chance.
- I don't care if it's a hundred to nothing.
I'm staying right here.
You'd rather have him dead than me alive?
That's exactly what I mean.
I should have killed him while I had the rifle on him.
Meg, get a- get a stick or something.
Scoop the dirt from under the rock.
They haven't counted us out yet.
I'm gonna track him down.
I'm gonna track him down and kill him.
Can't let a guy like that go on living.
You'll come to a little Indian village... called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10, they'll come and get us.
Your other choice is- you look to the right.
You'll see the Lagos de Zapitan.
They've got an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could be on your way to Mexico City.
Some mo- more, Meg.
Under my-
- What's the matter, baby?
- Ben, I've got to stop.
I can't go any further.
Oh, come on.
Just-Just a little farther, huh, honey?
Come on.
Just-Just- Just a little ways more, huh?
We'll bed down for the night in that- that canyon ahead, huh?
Come on.
That's a girl.
Stop!
- I see no one.
- Pa, look.
The river's full of money!
- What if the police come?
- The police?
Get into the truck.
Into the truck.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Meg.
- Meg.
Meg.
- Hmm?
Hmm.
- Look up there.
- Where?
- What is it?
- Meg... it's a hundred dollar bill.
It's wet.
It came from the stream.
Meg
- Meg... the stream is full of money.
Something's happened to Denning.
Ben!
You're not after the man now, you're after the money.
Meg, stay back!
It's Denning, He's
- He's all torn up.
There's a road up there.
Then he wasn't heading for Lagos de Zapitan?
He was headed for Santa Isabel.
He was going for help.
How do you like that?
Probably the first decent thing he's done in years... and he gets himself knocked off for it.
- I'm sorry, Ben, but I just-
- It's all right, honey.
Go on.
Go on.
Cry.
The guy loved you.
Didn't want you to die.
He deserves a few tears.
It's all right, baby.
Come on, Meg.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go home, huh, baby?
Let's go home and face the music, huh?

[Man Exhales]
- Well, you picked a hot day, mister.
- I always do.
- Fill her up, will ya?
- You bet.
Mighty nice transportation you got here.
- I'll sell it to you.
- [Chuckles] No, thanks.
- Gonna do a little hunting'?
- Well, I hope to.
You know a guy around here named Cameron
- Ben Cameron?
Sure, I know Ben.
If you need a guide, he's your man.
He knows this country like the palm of his hand.
That's what I hear.
How far is his place?
Oh, about 22 miles straight ahead.
Then you take the left fork.
I don't know whether Ben's taking on any new hunters right now though.
Got himself a new wife.
He stays, uh, pretty close to home these days.
Well, can't say I blame him.
Is she a nice girl?
- Awful nice girl.
Pretty as a picture.
City girl.
- Uh-huh.
Kind of a redhead, about, oh- about 5 foot 3?
Yeah, that's right.
Say, you must know her.
They got married up in San Francisco, right after Ben got back from Korea.
- [Bell Dings]
- Excuse me.
Well, that does her.
That'll be 9.42.
[Chuckles] I have to haul the stuff.
It kind of ups the price a little bit.
Here's 10.
What sort of place does he run?
Well, it ain't much right now, but Ben'll have her working before he's through.
- He runs 25- maybe 30 head of cattle.
- Uh-huh.
Straight down the road.
[Tire Squealing, Engine Roaring]
[Calf Bawling]
[Bawling Continues]
[Bawling]
- Ben, look out!
- [Calf Bawls]
[Ben] Stay where you are!
[Grunts]
Ben, are you all right?
Did he gore you?
Nah, he just stomped on me a little.
- Son of a gun is real happy about it, isn't he?
- Let me see.
Look, I'm okay.
It's just a bruise.
It happens all the time on a ranch.
- Ben!
- Don't get so excited about it.
I got to brand this fella.
[Sighs]
Isn't
- Isn't there some other way you can do that besides burning them?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I
- I could tie a letter to his tail that said he was mine.
- [Singeing] - [Calf Bawling]
Meg, you don't have to run out here every time I get mixed up with a cow.
That bull might've hurt you!
[Sighs] All right, Ben.
[Gasps] Ooh!
[Yelps]
[Meg Screaming] Ben!
Ben!
[Screaming Continues] Ben!
Ben, come in here right now!
Ben, come right in here!
- Wait-Wait a minute.
Here.
It's simple.
- Ben!
Just shut it off!
[Chuckling]
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!
That's all.
I told you not to use it.
I told you I had to clean out the water tank.
If I listened to every stupid story you told me, I'd go crazy!
- Don't get sore at me.
It's your own fault.
- Where's my towel?
You just won't listen!
I bet you will from now on.
- I'll bet you don't know what'll happen from now on.
- [Chuckles]
Oh, get out of here!
Go on.
Get out!
- All right.
All right.
- [Sobs]
Look, but that stuff dries fast in this climate.
You don't hurry up, you'll need a whisk broom instead of a towel.
- Leave me alone!
- All right.
Honey, what'd you do with that calf medicine I had in the cabinet?
- What calf medicine?
- The only calf medicine I had.
It was right here in a tin can.
You mean that stuff that looked like brown water?
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
It cost 11 bucks!
Well, how did I know it was calf medicine?
What'd you think I had it there for, a keepsake?
Eleven bucks thrown away.
Maybe it'll make the rocks grow.
Well, I didn't do it on purpose, and I'm sorry, and that's all I can say.
And if you're so worried about the money
- You've turned down three jobs this month already.
You bet I did.
I'm gonna turn down the next three too.
Sure, sure!
At a hundred dollars a week.
Meg, I'm not a guide.
I'm a rancher.
Can't you understand that?
This is a cattle ranch.
I mean, it's not much now, but it can be, if I take care of it.
There isn't any fun in our lives, Ben.
There's nothing but work from the time we get up in the morning... until the time we go to bed at night.
There isn't even a bath!
Honey.
Honey, there will be.
[Explosion]
Butane is a very explosive gas.
This safety valve is supposed to be closed when using... like I've told you maybe 60 times.
You don't close it, she blows up, and you've got a nice mess to clean up.
I don't have any mess to clean up.
You have.
Eh, that's pretty good.
[Chuckling] Wha-What was it?
It was a cake, you big goon.
Or have you forgotten today was your birthday?
[Chuckles] I guess I had.
No.
You never think about anything... except those ugly-looking cows, and you never have.
You can start thinking right now where you're gonna find yourself another filly... because this one's jumping the fence.
Aw, come on.
Now, don't talk like that, Meg.
Hey. [Chuckles] Hey, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Look, what can I do, huh?
You can get the truck unloaded so you can drive me into town.
And throw in some oats and some hay.
Boy, I sure can pick 'em.
I figured you'd fade in the stretch.
I did think you'd make it around the first turn.
Oh, it isn't that, Ben.
I'm not such a quitter.
Oh, honey, Meg.
What's the matter with us, honey?
We just shouldn't have gotten married in the first place, Ben.
I like it.
Where would you be if I-
- Go ahead.
Finish it.
- Oh.
Where would I be if you hadn't gotten me out of California and married me?
Serving nine more years in the penitentiary for violation of parole.
Meg, forget it.
I've never thrown it at you.
No, but it's always on your mind, isn't it?
You didn't want to marry me.
You were lonesome, you were out of the army... and you thought it was a good caper to get a girl out of a jam by marrying her.
Well, it was a good caper.
It was no way to start a marriage.
Aw, hey.
Come on.
Meg, come on now.
Forget it.
Look, I'm sorry about that calf medicine.
Look, baby.
Come on.
Let's forget the whole thing.
Ben, we can't forget it!
If there was a marriage to fight for, I'd stay here the rest of my life, but there isn't.
There isn't even any love, and you just can't live without that.
There was plenty of love with the other guy, I suppose, huh?
- Yes, I loved him.
- Yeah.
He got you in a jam and ran out on you.
Left you alone to face a 10-year rap!
Even after you got out on parole, he didn't show up, right?
- Yes.
- If that's love, I'll take mine straight!
I bet you still love the guy.
Come on.
Say it.
You're still nuts about him, aren't you?
- I think I hate him.
- But you're not sure, huh?
Oh, Ben, you don't understand.
You don't understand anything.
Once you've loved somebody, you never can be sure.
Even when it's changed to hate, you never know whether it's just the other side of love.
It's the way those things are.
Meg.
Meg, are you- are you goin' back to him?
Oh, I don't even know where he is.
And if I did, I'd never go back to him.
Let's just put it this way, Ben.
One man got me into jail, and another man saved me from going back.
Now it's time I did something on my own, without any help from anyone-just me.
- That's why I'm leaving.
- Meg, please don't go.
- Ben.
- Meg, honest- honestly, I'll try.
[Knocking]
What do you want?
- Mr. Cameron?
Ben Cameron?
- Yeah.
My name is Denning.
I've heard a lot about you and-
- Excuse me.
- My wife.
How do you do, Mrs. Cameron?
Just, uh, what is it you want, Mr., uh, Denning?
Well, I wanted to go across the border and do some shooting at Lagos de Zapitan.
Just cross the international bridge at Arivaca.
Hire yourself a guide.
No problem at all.
Well, frankly, I was expecting to come back with a little more than the legal limit.
I don't want to go through customs.
I'd like to go straight through.
And I don't want another guide.
I want you.
Uh-huh.
Well, why me?
Well, they tell me you're the best, and that's what I want.
Across the international border, it's an easy 20 miles.
The only other route is 50 miles of pure up and down.
I'm not interested.
They tell me your fee is a hundred dollars a week.
- I'll give you 200.
- [Ben Scoffs]
When my husband says he isn't interested, Mr. Denning, he isn't interested.
You couldn't buy him for a thousand a week, so stop wasting your time.
Will you let me handle this?
There's a lot of good guides in this country.
You won't have any trouble finding one at that price.
Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.
Think it over, Mr. Cameron.
- If you should change your mind, just-
- I won't.
Oh, uh, by the way, my wife is driving to town.
I'm too busy branding to drive her.
How about giving her a lift?
Why, certainly.
I'd be glad to.
Maybe I better wait till this evening, Ben, and let you drive me.
Why wait?
The man's got a nice car, plenty of room in it.
Let me take that.
Good-bye, Mr. Cameron.
Remember, Ben.
This is the way you wanted it.
Yeah.
I'm awful glad to see you, Meg.
- You knew I was here?
- Sure.
I've been hunting for you for quite a while.
I missed you, honey.
I've missed you too, Nardo, ever since the day I was arrested.
You were supposed to come back from Los Angeles that morning.
You never did.
I know.
I started, but I just never got there.
I started the night before.
Then I hit a truck on that straightaway going into Bakersfield.
I didn't come to for five weeks.
I don't believe you.
I can show you the records of the Bakersfield General Hospital, if you like- 14 months of'em.
You're too good on things like that, Nardo.
I wouldn't believe them either.
- Would you believe that?
- Nardo.
Took me six months before I could even write you a letter.
And when I did, it came back "addressee unknown."
I didn't know what had happened till I got back to San Francisco.
By then, you'd been in Tehachapi for almost a year.
So I got ahold of a lawyer.
I gave him some dough to work on your parole.
Then I had to get out of town.
- Where'd you go?
- Chicago.
But when I did make parole, you weren't there.
I know, honey.
I was in New York when the lawyer's letter came.
I got the news two weeks late.
So I caught the first plane to San Francisco, but... you weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.
Where'd you expect me to be?
I know, honey.
I don't blame you.
I just don't want you to blame me too much.
After all, we-we did find each other.
You do believe me, don't you?
I don't know what to believe.
I'm almost afraid to believe anything anymore.
Take me into town, Nardo.
Don't make me cry.
You know how I hate that.
I know, honey.
[Honks]
- Here.
Let me take that.
- I'd rather.
Meg.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
No, I don't think so, Nardo.
I have a lot of thinking to do.
Hello, Mrs. Cameron.
Having a night on the town?
I'd like a single with a bath.
Ben still working?
It's 212.
First room up on your right.
I'll bring your baggage up as soon as I register this gentleman.
- I'd like a bath too.
- Oh.
When you take up the lady's bag, take up a nice jar of bubble bath too, will you?
Yes, sir.
- Sandalwood, if you got it.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.

- ~ In my every breath ~~ - ~~ [Continues]
- You remember this song?
- Yes.
And this dress-Where?
Peacock Room, Palace Hotel, San Francisco.
We decided to become a team.
Ah, you do remember.
And what a team.
Best in the business.
- Why weren't we ever honest?
- What do you mean, honest?
We only took the people who could afford it.
We only took those who thought they could take us.
Nothing dishonest about that.
- Remember that wildcatter in Dallas?
- [Laughs]
Boy, what a killing.
[Laughs] You bought me a mink coat and a diamond clip.
Yeah. [Sighs] Oh, those were the days.
I hocked them when we went broke in Paris.
We weren't a very lucky team, were we?
Well, I don't say we didn't have a couple of hard times once in a while, but-
Listen, honey.
Let's sit down and have a drink.
Okay?
- Right over there.
- ~~ [Continues]
- Hiya, Barry.
- Well, hello, Ben.
I'm glad you dropped in.
That section of land next to yours is open now, if you want it.
[Chuckles] I came to sell you my place.
Still want to buy it?
You didn't seem to think my price was right.
Well, I changed my mind.
- ~~ [Continues]
- One old-fashioned with scotch and a brandy and soda.
Honey, I've got something big this time- bigger than you can imagine.
No, Nardo, I'm all through with that sort of thing.
Just count me out.
But, honey, don't get me wrong.
We've got enough to last us for the rest of our lives- one million dollars.
It's what I've always wanted.
And when I got it, I came for you.
How did you get it?
Look, sweetheart.
It was knowing about my deals that got you that jail term.
I don't want it to happen again.
Nobody can ever harm you for something you don't know.
But this is all wrapped up.
It's okay, it's safe and it's clean.
- And the police are after you.
- No, no.
That's the beauty of it.
Nobody's after me.
The police are after a bundle of money, but they don't know who's got it.
No description, no photograph, no nothing.
Just a big bundle of beautiful bills with Ben Franklin's picture on 'em.
- [Clicks Tongue] - ~~ [Continues]
That's why you wanted Ben to take you across the border- so you could get away with it, huh?
Well, Ben or anybody else.
I wanted Ben because I wanted his wife.
But for the money I'm willing to pay, we can hire another guide.
- We?
- Who else?
It was always "we."
Always will be.
Come on.
Drink your drink.
We'll make a fresh start, honey.
- Your dinner's ready, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
~~ [Ends]
Well, honeybunch, let's drink up, and tell me what's bothering you, huh?
It's Ben.
You mean that farmer?
I thought you were walking out on him anyhow.
Well, I did, but I'm not sure I should have.
You know, if it weren't for Ben, you know where I'd be now.
But why worry about it, honey?
You don't love the guy.
No, but I like him.
That's pretty important.
What about me?
I guess I love you, Nardo.
I've tried not to.
I
- I thought I was all over it, but I-
I guess I was wrong.
The minute I saw your face, it all came back to me.
[Sighs] Well, you're like something I've caught... and can't quite cure myself of.
I'll get another guide to take us across.
We'll be out of here before morning.
No, we've got to see Ben first-you and I.
Okay.
I don't relish the prospect... but if that's what you want, that's the way it's going to be.
Let's go now and get it over.
~~ [Jazz]
- Hi, Fred.
- Hi, Ben.
- Can I look at that?
- Sure.
212, huh?
[Fred] She ain't up there, Ben.
Where is she?
She left a couple of minutes ago.
- With a guy in a sports car?
- Yeah.
That's right, Ben.
Well
- Gives me a chance to do a little drinking, huh?
Right, Ben.
[Siren Wailing]
[Siren Stops]
- What'd I do wrong, Officer?
- Nothing, I hope.
Can I see your registration certificate?
I know I didn't run through a stoplight.
Was I going too fast?
Can I see your registration certificate?
Well, if I've broken some traffic law, I'm sorry.
If you won't tell me what I did, just write out the ticket, and let's get it over with.
Well, I'm not police.
I'm border patrol.
- Border patrol.
This far from the border?
- That's right, sir.
Nine miles.
We cover back as far as 20 miles.
At 10 miles, we have quite a few spot checks.
- May I take a look in the trunk?
- The trunk?
Sure.
Right back here.
Do you have the key?
Look, Officer.
It's kind of late, and the lady's married.
I got to get her back home fast.
Can't you sort of forget that you ever saw us?
This is the only service I know of that's absolutely free.
You have no right to search my car without a warrant.
Now, look, mister.
We're looking for something special.
We're covering the border from Brownsville to Tijuana.
Now get that key and get it fast.
Here.
What's the matter?
The border patrol won't give you any trouble.
They're always very nice.
Why didn't you want him to look in the trunk?
He wants me to pull up a little.
- [Tire Squealing] - [Screams]
Nardo!
- [Engine Revving]
- Nardo, what have you done?
[Gasps]
[Engine Revs]
[Screams]
- [Screams] - [Revving Continues]
[Screams]
- [Gasping]
- Meg.
- Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
- Meg, what's wrong with you?
- Meg, what's wrong with you?
- [Sobs]
I was only trying to stop you, honey.
- I thought you were trying to kill me.
- Oh, Meg, sweetheart.
I thought you killed him- I mean, deliberately.
I didn't know the gear was in reverse.
- I promise you I didn't!
- Oh, I know.
Come on.
- Feel better, honey?
- Yes, thanks.
Looks like we'll have to walk.
The rocks have busted the gas tank.
[Thuds]
[Clock Ticks]
Lee, it's five minutes to 3:00.
Will you put out a missing person's alarm?
- [Siren Wailing]
- Look, Ben.
- You'll only make a fool out of yourself.
She'll show up.
- [Siren Stops]
I've been through this before.
You think you're the only guy whose wife steps out on him?
- That isn't funny, Lee.
- Oh, look.
It happens all the time.
- Something might've happened to her.
- [Door Opens]
Sheriff, give us a hand here!
- [Sheriff] It's Harry Castleton.
- I found him on 26.
[Harry, Gasping] Guy... ran over me... twice.
Had a
- Had a... redhead... with him... in a... pink sports car.
On
- On purpose.
[Gasps]
[Sheriff] Go on, Harry.
Talk!
He can't talk.
He's dead.
Meg!
Meg!
Open the door.
[Ben Knocks] Meg!
He's simply got to take us across now.
We don't dare get another guide.
Meg, open the door!
And another thing.
You never saw me before in your whole life, okay?
- Okay.
- Meg, open the door!
[Banging]
[Panting] I should've known you'd be with him.
- Get out of here!
- I can't.
My car's bogged down.
You've got a lot more than a car to worry about.
The man you killed has four kids.
That was an accident.
She was there.
She'll tell you.
Get some decent clothes on.
I'm taking you into Arivaca.
- What for?
- So you can tell 'em what you know about this mess.
I can't do that, Ben.
She's right, Cameron.
It was only hit-and-run, but she's an accessory.
Her fingerprints are all over that car, and there's a good chance they're on the body too.
You've got to take us across the border into Mexico.
All she has to do is tell the truth.
I told you to get dressed.
- I won't go, Ben.
I won't!
- Then you'll go as you are.
- No, Ben.
No!
Please let me go!
- Come on.
- No!
Let me go, Ben!
Ben, I'm-
- Cameron!
- Go on and shoot!
You haven't the guts.
- I don't need guts.
I need you.
- You're on your way, baby.
- No, I can't go.
You know I can't!
- Shut up!
- Ben, when I get back there, they'll check on me.
They'll find out I've broken my parole, and I'll spend the next nine years in the penitentiary.
- Can't you learn to keep your mouth shut?
- So that's the way it is.
The lady generates a little heat.
I wondered why you married him.
Now I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Boy- [Chuckles] You two really deserve each other.
- You gonna take us or not?
- Ben, you've got to.
How much would you say she was worth?
Well, I offered you $200 before, and you turned it down.
That was before you killed Harry Castleton.
A thousand.
That may be all your stinking carcass is worth.
Look.
What about hers?
Well, you would know more about that than I would.
5,000 for the whole deal.
Nah.
I'd say about, uh, 10.
Ben, I'll go to jail if you don't.
Will ya listen?
She's in it all the way, Cameron.
You wouldn't expect me to put a higher value on your wife than you would yourself.
Don't play around with me, Denning.
I'll turn you both over to the cops.
I believe you would.
- All right. 10,000.
- Cash on the line?
I don't know whether I can trust you.
You might decide to turn me over on this side of the border.
[Exhales] You've got the gun.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Ben, I
- I'm sorry.
Shut up.
I picked a tramp, and I know it.
I wouldn't let a dog spend nine years in jail if I could help it.
Especially for 10,000 bucks.
Oh, look, it's dangerous handling that amount of money.
I'd rather you'd carry it.
I got a feeling I can trust you.
- Uh, you can keep her too.
- I'm gonna take you up on that.
- When do we leave?
- Right now.
You got three minutes to get dressed, pack some grub and join us.
What's in the bag?
Change of underwear.
You must have problems.
Where do you think you're going?
I think I'll ride in the truck with you.
You and Meg are riding in here.
I'm driving the rig.
I don't think so.
I'd rather ride alongside of you.
Look, Mac.
Let's understand each other.
From now on, you do exactly what I tell you to do, and you'll do it on the double.
Because when you stop taking orders, I stop moving.
When I stop moving, you're a gone goose.
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I think it does.
- In the trailer.
- [Clatters]
When the motor starts, turn the lights off.
And keep 'em off.
Here.
You two get some sleep.
I know I can trust you together.
What's, uh-What's that?
Hay?
In case you're interested, your wife's behavior with me tonight has been impeccable.
I'm, uh
- I'm just a farmer, Denning.
I don't know what that word "impeccable" means.
If it means what it sounds like, uh, congratulations.
- [Chuckles] - [Door Creaks]
Any chance of him double-crossing us?
No.
He isn't as experienced at double-crossing as you and I.
He never made a living at it.
Whatever he says he'll do, you can count on it.
He almost made a square out of you, sweetheart.
[Clattering]
A slug in my head right now would send 30,000 volts through yours.
[Engine Starts]
- Denning- - [Gasps]
Don't jump.
Don't move.
You might get hurt.
- [Gasps]
- Don't lift your head.
You'll get an ugly scratch if you do.
What's the beef, Cameron?
- You ever see a knife like this before?
- No, I don't think I have.
We use 'em to stick turkeys with.
She slides in at the base of the throat, moves straight up into the brain.
It's like peeling a banana.
I've done it a million times.
I hope the novelty's worn off by now.
There are gonna be lots of times on this trip when we won't be able to watch each other... like when we're asleep.
I don't like anybody holding a gun on me while I'm driving.
Okay.
You've made your point.
Or any other time!
If that ever happens again, Denning-
From now on, we walk.
Most of the time, straight up.
I'm dumping the trailer and truck over the cliff.
You grab a pack.
Get your stuff together.
Don't take any more than you can carry.
I'm awful sensitive about packing stuff that isn't mine.
- Cameron-
- Yeah?
- Are you sure we can't take this rig any further?
- Yeah.
What if we have to turn back?
If we have to turn back, your buddy'll have more than transportation to worry about.
We'd still have the truck and trailer.
I'm not leaving any road signs behind me.
By the time she hits the bottom of that canyon, she'll be in so many pieces... they won't be able to spot 'em from an airplane.
If there's any danger of the border police getting on our trail, I think we ought to-
I got news for you, Mac.
They're already on our trail.
But can't we at least hide the truck in case we need it later?
If we ever get in a spot where you need this truck to pull you out... you'll be a dead duck anyhow.
[Clattering]
You get out on the point and watch her splatter.
[Engine Starts]
Better toss over that case too.
You're not gonna have time to change underwear on this trip.
You just take care of your end.
I'll take care of mine.
You never liked it anyway.
Come on.
It'll take four or five hours to get around this cliff.
We don't have enough daylight.
We'll stay here and wait till morning.
What in tarnation you folks doin' way up here?
Hiya, pop.
Ben Cameron!
- Hiya, Ben.
- Hi.
Hiya, Ms. Cameron.
Phew.
What do you figure doin' up here, son?
Jumpin' my claim?
- No.
I'm just taking this dude hunting.
- Huntin'?
Where's your gun?
Well, we don't need 'em.
- We're
- We're gonna scare the game to death.
- [Pop Laughs]
- Having a little trouble though.
- Uh-huh.
What's your problem?
Well, we could save time if we had a rope.
- A rope?
- Yeah, to get these two up there.
Well, time's kind of cheap, but, uh, ropes come pretty dear iffen you ain't got one.
- How much?
- How about two dollars?
- I'll give you five.
- Good Lord.
For five, I'll carry you up piggyback.
You wait right here!
There's a rock up there- I used to could hit it first try.
Here, here.
Let me do it.
That's pretty good, boy.
Couldn't have done it much better myself.
I'll do the hauling.
You tie 'em on down here, huh?
Okay, son.
All right, Denning, you go first.
Hey, pop.
Tie the dude on, will ya?
[Pop] Okay.
Sure hope this holds.
Do you, uh, got that five dollars handy?
Here.
Denning, you just hold on.
I'll pull.
[Straining] Uh, you just use your feet as much as you can.
- Let me down, Cameron!
- [Laughing]
[Screams] Wow!
Oh, wow!
- Let me down!
- [Laughs]
Hey!
That's-That's nice underwear you've got.
Man, that's a crazy color.
This is what I've been lookin' for all my life.
I'd sure like to know where your claim is, mister.
- [Giggles] This even feels good!
- I'll take care of it.
- No, no.
Don't mind at all.
Don't mind to help.
- Just take it easy, pop.
[Chuckles] I'd like to have this job by the week.
Maybe you will.
Say, uh, where is that claim of yours?
Right over here.
Come on.
I'd like to show it to you.
Take care of this, Meg.
There she be!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You got to play it the way the cards fall.
He'd have told half the state.
- Bury him.
- You're crazy.
Bury him!
Here's your wire from Washington, Captain.
Well, that ought to tie it up, especially with this fingerprint report.
"The prints on Harry Castleton's belt belong to a woman named Margaret Fowler.
"She drew a one-to-10-year rap in Tehachapi for a bunco job.
Out on parole after serving one year."
And her fingerprints match up just fine with Ben Cameron's wife.
You don't think Ben's mixed up in this, do you?
The dame's messed up in it bad.
That dress was found in their cabin.
As for Ben, why not?
He sold his place and moved out the night of the murder.
Ben was with me when Harry Castleton was brought in.
So Cameron helps his wife out of a jam.
After her two-timing him with that fancy Dan?
That's the kind of a guy Ben is.
Yeah, it figures, all right.
If I know Ben, and I think I do, I know just where he's gonna try to cross over.
[Engine Roaring]
- Which way?
- The right.
- Why don't you take the lead?
- If I'm gonna be shot, I want to see it comin'.
Go ahead.
[Static On Radio]
~~ [Jazz]
You, uh- You a music lover, Denning?
No, but I'm a sucker for police broadcasts.
I'll give you two about an hour.
- For what?
- To rest.
Then we start out again.
You mean we're gonna travel tonight?
All night.
Aren't you pushing things a little hard, Cameron?
Your wife's kind of tired.
You can carry her pack.
We have all day tomorrow for sleeping.
I can walk right alongside of you night and day, Cameron.
I'd just like to know the reason why.
We have to cross the upper end of the Papago Reservation.
If we try it by daylight, we'll be spotted.
We have to make it tonight.
Sounds reasonable.
Just how far are we from the border?
Too far.
I'm gonna take a look for the best way down.
I'll be back.
~~ [Continues]
I'm sorry about what happened back there with the old man, honey.
I had to do it.
He'd have talked.
You know that, don't you?
- Sure.
He'd have talked.
- And that would've been the end of it.
They'd have picked us up in 24 hours.
You'd have gone back to jail.
Me too.
We might never have gotten together again.
- So we had to kill him.
- Sure.
And the man we ran over- It wasn't an accident, was it?
- We had to kill him too, didn't we?
- Now, look here, sweetheart.
The first thing they teach you in the Marine Corps is to cover yourself.
You come first.
It's got to be that way.
You make it sound like a virtue... as if it were our Christian duty to kill anyone that gets in our way.
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get this "our" business?
You had nothing to do with it.
We're a team, aren't we?
It's never been you or me.
It's always been us.
And it always will be us.
Don't think of the past, sweetheart.
Think of the future.
Think of us together... once we get rid of that husband of yours.
- What do you mean, get rid of him?
- Wait a minute, honey.
I'm no gun-crazy killer.
I don't go out looking for trouble.
I've got nothing against Cameron.
As far as I can see, I never should have.
But you said "get rid of him."
I meant when we get across the border.
I'll pay him off, I'll tell him about us... and that's all there'll be to it.
Nardo, get the $10,000.
Put it on his pack so he'll find it when he gets back.
- What does that get us?
- It'll get us out of here.
We don't need him anymore.
- You mean, we're already across the border?
- No, but we're very close to it.
How close?
- Remember what Ben said about the Papago Reservation?
- Yeah.
Well, we've been there- Ben and I.
It's a long, narrow valley dotted with little Indian farms.
The border's just the other side of it- down there.
- [Denning] How far would you guess?
- Five miles.
Maybe less.
Then we don't need Ben.
We can make it alone.
After you've put the money on the pack.
Let's go, honey.
This is something we waited for for three years.
~~ [Jazz Continues On Radio]
Listen.
We've never quite been able to get away from San Francisco, have we?
I don't want to get away from it- not that part of it.
I want to get away from the rest of it.
Honey, we're all through taking the suckers.
We're all through scrounging for money.
From now on, it's gonna be just you... and me.
- ~~ [Continues]
- Get what you need.
~~ [Stops]
[Whistle Blowing In Distance]

Let's get off the road.
Get gun.

Help, somebody!
Help!
[Screams]
[Rustling]
- What's the matter with you?
What are you trying to do to me?
- [Panting]
Don't get scared, son.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Nice cow.
You pay.
Drop the gun, Denning.
Pick it up.
Give it to me.
- Pay the boy for the cow.
- How much?
Five of those bills you got in your pocket.
- $500?
- Yeah.
We were hunting out on the reservation by mistake.
- You won't tell, huh?
- No.
Here's your gun.
We won't cause you any more trouble.
Let's go back and pick up the gear you left.
Why don't we go on across the border?
I'll be on my way.
How close to the border you think we are?
I thought about five miles.
Five miles?
Why do you look at her?
Is that what she told you?
How would she know?
She's never been here before.
We've got a good two days' hike to cross over.
Why'd you do it, Meg?
Because something's happened to you, Nardo.
Something terrible.
I thought the first one was an accident.
But now I know it wasn't.
- You're a killer.
- That still makes us a team.
I do my own killing.
You want a judge to do yours.
Ben, I
- I should have told you this before.
- This is-
- I know who he is.
She kept your picture.
She was pretty crazy about you.
- I guess she still is.
- Yeah, sure.
Just hope she doesn't get that crazy about you, Cameron.
Because you'll watch her the rest of your life.
What they've done once, they'll do again.
Let's get going.
Okay, we'll stop here.
We can sleep till noon.
You go down there.
We'll stay here.
Here, I'll take that.
Ben?
- Ben.
- Hmm.
Ben, I- [Sighs]
I'm no good, Ben.
I'm no good for anybody.
He still loves me, and I tried to raise the whole countryside so he'd be caught.
Almost did.
I never saw anybody so anxious to get back to the penitentiary.
Why'd you do it?
He wanted to kill you.
Well, we have a lot in common.
I want to kill him.
I'm cured of him, Ben.
Yeah?
Maybe.
There's no maybe about it.
When your blood turns cold and you can't bear the thought of him touching you, you're cured.
Let's leave here, Ben.
Let's leave here and go back to home.
It's not that easy.
You're mixed up in two murders.
There'd be too much explaining.
Besides, I want to be around when Denning dies.
[Whispers] Ben-
That's the way it is.
- You mean you'd kill him?
- [Chuckles]
Look.
I've got a rifle wrapped up in this blanket.
Do you know why?
If I didn't, I'd kill him a hundred times a day.
Not for the money?
No, not- not just for the money.
If the money's there, I'm not gonna walk away from it.
How's your arm?
It's swelling a little.
It hurts.
It's bound to.
Go on.
Go and get some sleep.
- [Thunder Rumbling] - [No Audible Dialogue]
[Thunderclap]
[Thunderclap]
- What's the matter, Meg?
- My arm.
Too painful!
Honey
- Honey, you have a fever.
- Why didn't you tell me, huh?
- I didn't know.
Come on.
We'll find shelter in that cave.
Can you make it?
[Thunderclap]
Sit down.
Here, let me help.
Let me look at that arm.
How is it?
It's
- It's not good.
- Is it
- Is it infected?
- You should have told me.
Everything's soaked.
Hey, don't get too comfortable.
We're gathering wood.
You gather it.
If he makes a wrong move, shoot him.
[Thunderclap]
I got to have something dry to start it with.
Fat chance.
You got anything that might be dry?
It's been raining just as hard on me as it has on you.
All right, Denning.
Give it to me.
- You're crazy.
- I've got to boil some water.
She's got an armful of gangrene.
Give me my 10 grand.
9,500.
You bought a cow, don't forget.
Do you think she'd burn up $ 10,000 on you?
I can't believe you're a natural-born fool.
You must have trained for it.
Here.
Keep your eye on him.
The wood's drier now.
The next batch oughta do it.
All right, Denning, let's- let's have some more.
No.
I'll never have a better excuse for killing you.
That's what you'll have to do.
[Rattling]
Don't move.
[Rattling Continues]
Meg, the rifle.
[Rattling Stops]
[Rattling Resumes]
[Rattling Intensely]
[Sighs] I'm afraid I'll miss.
Meg, you won't miss.
I might hit you.
You won't hit me.
Just... cock the hammer... and aim like I taught you.
- Good try.
- Thanks.
And thank you.
Here, baby.
Come on.
Good girl.
Here.
You lie down.
I'll have a fire going in a jiffy.
Come on.
[Thunderclap]
One thing I gotta say for us, we sure got money to burn.
By the way, Denning, where'd you get this stuff, huh?
Oh, a fellow I know left it with me.
He was a little hot, so I held it until he cooled off.
So when he came back, you- you just weren't there, huh?
That's right.
He, uh, didn't know you very well, did he?
Oh, he knew me very well.
He was my best friend.
[Thunderclap]
All right, baby, come on.
Turn over, huh?
Easy.
That's it.
I'm just gonna cut away your sleeve.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, baby.
Raise up a little.
That's it.
[Thunderclap]
All right, baby, this is gonna be hot now.
- [Whimpers]
- Easy.
Easy, honey.
Easy.
That's it.
That's it.
Now, baby, this is gonna hurt.
Now, you just yell as much as you want, huh?
[Thunderclap]
[Screaming]
[Ben] I know.
I know, baby.
Easy.
[Bawling]
[Ben] That's all, honey.
There.
[Crying]
[Yelping]
That's it, baby.
Easy.
Now, easy.
That's it.
That's my girl.
It's all over now, honey.
It's all over, baby.
That's it.
It's all over, baby.
Now the dead flesh is cut away, the pain goes awfully fast.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I had to hurt you, Meg.
What are you so nervous about?
I'm just gonna go out and get some firewood.
You know, if you were on a desert island with that guy... and there was nothing there but rocks... pretty soon he'd have all the rocks moved to his side of the beach.
How do you feel, huh?
- Lots better.
- Sure.
You'll be on your feet by the time this storm peters out.
- Ben.
- Yeah?
If
- If I were to go back to jail, would you wait for me?
[Scoffs] Honey, till you're a little old, old lady.
Let's go back to the ranch.
Well, I haven't got a ranch.
I
- I sold it.
- Sold it?
- Yeah, to Floyd Barry.
- Sold it when?
- Night I came to town to pick you up.
But-You-You loved that scraggly old piece of desert.
Nah, I was getting a bellyful of it.
Besides, I figured it was either you or the ranch... and I
- I reckon I liked you best.
Oh, Ben, I-I'm scared.
Ben, l-let's tell him he can have all the money.
Look, honey, we've witnessed two murders.
He's got to try to kill us.
Money isn't the point anymore.
Except that you think you're going to end up with all of it.
I'm not gonna leave it there for the coyotes.
We're all fouled up, honey.
We gotta have money to stay clear.
Not that kind, Ben.
What-What can you do with it, except run for the rest of your life?
Me, honey?
[Chuckles]
I'd buy you things.
Buy you some new shoes.
I'd buy you 300 pink dresses.
Pardon me.
Maybe I should have knocked.
- How's the weather outside?
- Wet.
I think I'll take a light from your fire.
Hey, that'll cost you 25,000.
A little more than I can afford.
Besides, the storm is clearing up anyway.
[Laughing]
What's so funny?
I was just thinking what a fool I am... trying to stay awake to watch you.
You're the one who has to do the watching, not I.
Good night, Cameron.
Too bad you can't join me in pleasant dreams.
[Groaning]
Ben, I'm cold.
Is that better?
Look.
It's still raining in San Felipe.
How far away is that storm?
About four miles.
San Felipe's 10 miles south of the border.
Yeah.
That puts me in Mexico right now.
Since, uh, yesterday.
- Meg, come down here.
- Stay there.
You think I won't?
I think you will.
But she stays there.
[Screams]
[Gagging]
Get away from him.
Get away from him.
No, Nardo!
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna use any ammunition I might need later on.
What do you think your chances are of getting out of here?
About 60-40... maybe a little less.
A lot less.
You're through, Cameron.
- So are you, if you stay with him.
- Worry about yourself.
I'll be all right.
I don't have an infected arm.
I don't have my leg covered in rocks.
But I do have a gun, so I'll eat.
I can't miss so long as I keep heading' south.
- What do you think?
- Yeah, you stand a pretty good chance.
My chances would be a lot better if you give me some instructions.
I'll do better than give you instructions.
I'll give you a choice.
Down this canyon, about two and a half miles... you come to a road.
It goes to the left.
You follow that road, you'll come to a little...
Indian village called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10... tell them where we are.
They'll come and help us.
You'd do as much for me, I suppose?
That's neither here nor there.
The only trouble with Santa Isabel, it's... in the opposite direction to where you want to go.
[Chuckles] That's what I figured.
Your other choice is- when you get to the road, you look to the right.
You'll see the Lagos de Zapitan.
They have an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could- you could be on your way to Mexico City.
I like that better.
Why don't you tell her to come along with me?
She needs a doctor.
No reason for you both to die here... unless you want it that way.
It makes a crazy kind of sense, Meg.
- Better pack your stuff and go with him.
- No.
- We haven't got a 50-to-1 chance.
- I don't care if it's a hundred to nothing.
I'm staying right here.
You'd rather have him dead than me alive?
That's exactly what I mean.
I should have killed him while I had the rifle on him.
Meg, get a- get a stick or something.
Scoop the dirt from under the rock.
They haven't counted us out yet.
I'm gonna track him down.
I'm gonna track him down and kill him.
Can't let a guy like that go on living.
[Ben's Voice] You'll come to a little Indian village... called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10, they'll come and get us.
Your other choice is- you look to the right.
You'll see the Lagos de Zapitan.
They've got an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could be on your way to Mexico City.
Some mo- more, Meg.
- Under my- - [Grunts]
[Grunts]
- What's the matter, baby?
- Ben, I've got to stop.
I can't go any further.
Oh, come on.
Just-Just a little farther, huh, honey?
Come on.
Just-Just- Just a little ways more, huh?
We'll bed down for the night in that- that canyon ahead, huh?
Come on.
That's a girl.
Stop!
[Screams]
- I see no one.
- Pa, look.
The river's full of money!
- What if the police come?
- The police?
Get into the truck.
Into the truck.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
[Crow Cawing, Distant]
[Cawing Continues]
[Cawing, Closer]
Meg.
- Meg.
Meg.
- Hmm?
Hmm.
- Look up there.
- Where?
[Caws]
- What is it?
- Meg... it's a hundred dollar bill.
It's wet.
It came from the stream.
Meg
- Meg... the stream is full of money.
Something's happened to Denning.
Ben!
You're not after the man now, you're after the money.
Meg, stay back!
It's Denning, He's
- He's all torn up.
There's a road up there.
Then he wasn't heading for Lagos de Zapitan?
He was headed for Santa Isabel.
He was going for help.
How do you like that?
Probably the first decent thing he's done in years... and he gets himself knocked off for it.
- I'm sorry, Ben, but I just-
- It's all right, honey.
Go on.
Go on.
Cry.
The guy loved you.
Didn't want you to die.
He deserves a few tears.
It's all right, baby.
Come on, Meg.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go home, huh, baby?
Let's go home and face the music, huh?
- Well, you picked a hot day, mister.
- I always do.
- Fill her up, will ya?
- You bet.
Mighty nice transportation you got here.
- I'll sell it to you.
- No, thanks.
- Gonna do a little hunting'?
- Well, I hope to.
You know a guy around here named Cameron
- Ben Cameron?
Sure, I know Ben.
If you need a guide, he's your man.
He knows this country like the palm of his hand.
That's what I hear.
How far is his place?
Oh, about 22 miles straight ahead.
Then you take the left fork.
I don't know whether Ben's taking on any new hunters right now though.
Got himself a new wife.
He stays, uh, pretty close to home these days.
Well, can't say I blame him.
Is she a nice girl?
- Awful nice girl.
Pretty as a picture.
City girl.
- Uh-huh.
Kind of a redhead, about, oh- about 5 foot 3?
Yeah, that's right.
Say, you must know her.
They got married up in San Francisco, right after Ben got back from Korea.
Excuse me.
Well, that does her.
That'll be 9.42.
I have to haul the stuff.
It kind of ups the price a little bit.
Here's 10.
What sort of place does he run?
Well, it ain't much right now, but Ben'll have her working before he's through.
- He runs 25- maybe 30 head of cattle.
- Uh-huh.
Straight down the road.
Ben, look out!
Stay where you are!
Ben, are you all right?
Did he gore you?
Nah, he just stomped on me a little.
- Son of a gun is real happy about it, isn't he?
- Let me see.
Look, I'm okay.
It's just a bruise.
It happens all the time on a ranch.
- Ben!
- Don't get so excited about it.
I got to brand this fella.
Isn't
- Isn't there some other way you can do that besides burning them?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I
- I could tie a letter to his tail that said he was mine.
Meg, you don't have to run out here every time I get mixed up with a cow.
That bull might've hurt you!
All right, Ben.
Ooh!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben, come in here right now!
Ben, come right in here!
- Wait-Wait a minute.
Here.
It's simple.
- Ben!
Just shut it off!
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!
That's all.
I told you not to use it.
I told you I had to clean out the water tank.
If I listened to every stupid story you told me, I'd go crazy!
- Don't get sore at me.
It's your own fault.
- Where's my towel?
You just won't listen!
I bet you will from now on.
- I'll bet you don't know what'll happen from now on.
Oh, get out of here!
Go on.
Get out!
All right.
All right.
Look, but that stuff dries fast in this climate.
You don't hurry up, you'll need a whisk broom instead of a towel.
- Leave me alone!
- All right.
Honey, what'd you do with that calf medicine I had in the cabinet?
- What calf medicine?
- The only calf medicine I had.
It was right here in a tin can.
You mean that stuff that looked like brown water?
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
It cost 11 bucks!
Well, how did I know it was calf medicine?
What'd you think I had it there for, a keepsake?
Eleven bucks thrown away.
Maybe it'll make the rocks grow.
Well, I didn't do it on purpose, and I'm sorry, and that's all I can say.
And if you're so worried about the money
- You've turned down three jobs this month already.
You bet I did.
I'm gonna turn down the next three too.
Sure, sure!
At a hundred dollars a week.
Meg, I'm not a guide.
I'm a rancher.
Can't you understand that?
This is a cattle ranch.
I mean, it's not much now, but it can be, if I take care of it.
There isn't any fun in our lives, Ben.
There's nothing but work from the time we get up in the morning... until the time we go to bed at night.
There isn't even a bath!
Honey.
Honey, there will be.
Butane is a very explosive gas.
This safety valve is supposed to be closed when using... like I've told you maybe 60 times.
You don't close it, she blows up, and you've got a nice mess to clean up.
I don't have any mess to clean up.
You have.
Eh, that's pretty good.
Wha-What was it?
It was a cake, you big goon.
Or have you forgotten today was your birthday?
I guess I had.
No.
You never think about anything... except those ugly-looking cows, and you never have.
You can start thinking right now where you're gonna find yourself another filly... because this one's jumping the fence.
Aw, come on.
Now, don't talk like that, Meg.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Look, what can I do, huh?
You can get the truck unloaded so you can drive me into town.
And throw in some oats and some hay.
Boy, I sure can pick 'em.
I figured you'd fade in the stretch.
I did think you'd make it around the first turn.
Oh, it isn't that, Ben.
I'm not such a quitter.
Oh, honey, Meg.
What's the matter with us, honey?
We just shouldn't have gotten married in the first place, Ben.
I like it.
Where would you be if I-
- Go ahead.
Finish it.
- Oh.
Where would I be if you hadn't gotten me out of California and married me?
Serving nine more years in the penitentiary for violation of parole.
Meg, forget it.
I've never thrown it at you.
No, but it's always on your mind, isn't it?
You didn't want to marry me.
You were lonesome, you were out of the army... and you thought it was a good caper to get a girl out of a jam by marrying her.
Well, it was a good caper.
It was no way to start a marriage.
Aw, hey.
Come on.
Meg, come on now.
Forget it.
Look, I'm sorry about that calf medicine.
Look, baby.
Come on.
Let's forget the whole thing.
Ben, we can't forget it!
If there was a marriage to fight for, I'd stay here the rest of my life, but there isn't.
There isn't even any love, and you just can't live without that.
There was plenty of love with the other guy, I suppose, huh?
- Yes, I loved him.
- Yeah.
He got you in a jam and ran out on you.
Left you alone to face a 10-year rap!
Even after you got out on parole, he didn't show up, right?
- Yes.
- If that's love, I'll take mine straight!
I bet you still love the guy.
Come on.
Say it.
You're still nuts about him, aren't you?
- I think I hate him.
- But you're not sure, huh?
Oh, Ben, you don't understand.
You don't understand anything.
Once you've loved somebody, you never can be sure.
Even when it's changed to hate, you never know whether it's just the other side of love.
It's the way those things are.
Meg.
Meg, are you- are you goin' back to him?
Oh, I don't even know where he is.
And if I did, I'd never go back to him.
Let's just put it this way, Ben.
One man got me into jail, and another man saved me from going back.
Now it's time I did something on my own, without any help from anyone-just me.
- That's why I'm leaving.
- Meg, please don't go.
- Ben.
- Meg, honest- honestly, I'll try.
What do you want?
- Mr. Cameron?
Ben Cameron?
- Yeah.
My name is Denning.
I've heard a lot about you and-
- Excuse me.
- My wife.
How do you do, Mrs. Cameron?
Just, uh, what is it you want, Mr., uh, Denning?
Well, I wanted to go across the border and do some shooting at Lagos de Zapitan.
Just cross the international bridge at Arivaca.
Hire yourself a guide.
No problem at all.
Well, frankly, I was expecting to come back with a little more than the legal limit.
I don't want to go through customs.
I'd like to go straight through.
And I don't want another guide.
I want you.
Uh-huh.
Well, why me?
Well, they tell me you're the best, and that's what I want.
Across the international border, it's an easy 20 miles.
The only other route is 50 miles of pure up and down.
I'm not interested.
They tell me your fee is a hundred dollars a week.
I'll give you 200.
When my husband says he isn't interested, Mr. Denning, he isn't interested.
You couldn't buy him for a thousand a week, so stop wasting your time.
Will you let me handle this?
There's a lot of good guides in this country.
You won't have any trouble finding one at that price.
Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.
Think it over, Mr. Cameron.
- If you should change your mind, just-
- I won't.
Oh, uh, by the way, my wife is driving to town.
I'm too busy branding to drive her.
How about giving her a lift?
Why, certainly.
I'd be glad to.
Maybe I better wait till this evening, Ben, and let you drive me.
Why wait?
The man's got a nice car, plenty of room in it.
Let me take that.
Good-bye, Mr. Cameron.
Remember, Ben.
This is the way you wanted it.
Yeah.
I'm awful glad to see you, Meg.
- You knew I was here?
- Sure.
I've been hunting for you for quite a while.
I missed you, honey.
I've missed you too, Nardo, ever since the day I was arrested.
You were supposed to come back from Los Angeles that morning.
You never did.
I know.
I started, but I just never got there.
I started the night before.
Then I hit a truck on that straightaway going into Bakersfield.
I didn't come to for five weeks.
I don't believe you.
I can show you the records of the Bakersfield General Hospital, if you like- 14 months of'em.
You're too good on things like that, Nardo.
I wouldn't believe them either.
- Would you believe that?
- Nardo.
Took me six months before I could even write you a letter.
And when I did, it came back "addressee unknown."
I didn't know what had happened till I got back to San Francisco.
By then, you'd been in Tehachapi for almost a year.
So I got ahold of a lawyer.
I gave him some dough to work on your parole.
Then I had to get out of town.
- Where'd you go?
- Chicago.
But when I did make parole, you weren't there.
I know, honey.
I was in New York when the lawyer's letter came.
I got the news two weeks late.
So I caught the first plane to San Francisco, but... you weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.
Where'd you expect me to be?
I know, honey.
I don't blame you.
I just don't want you to blame me too much.
After all, we-we did find each other.
You do believe me, don't you?
I don't know what to believe.
I'm almost afraid to believe anything anymore.
Take me into town, Nardo.
Don't make me cry.
You know how I hate that.
I know, honey.
- Here.
Let me take that.
- I'd rather.
Meg.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
No, I don't think so, Nardo.
I have a lot of thinking to do.
Hello, Mrs. Cameron.
Having a night on the town?
I'd like a single with a bath.
Ben still working?
It's 212.
First room up on your right.
I'll bring your baggage up as soon as I register this gentleman.
- I'd like a bath too.
- Oh.
When you take up the lady's bag, take up a nice jar of bubble bath too, will you?
Yes, sir.
- Sandalwood, if you got it.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You remember this song?
- Yes.
And this dress-Where?
Peacock Room, Palace Hotel, San Francisco.
We decided to become a team.
Ah, you do remember.
And what a team.
Best in the business.
- Why weren't we ever honest?
- What do you mean, honest?
We only took the people who could afford it.
We only took those who thought they could take us.
Nothing dishonest about that.
Remember that wildcatter in Dallas?
Boy, what a killing.
You bought me a mink coat and a diamond clip.
Yeah.
Oh, those were the days.
I hocked them when we went broke in Paris.
We weren't a very lucky team, were we?
Well, I don't say we didn't have a couple of hard times once in a while, but-
Listen, honey.
Let's sit down and have a drink.
Okay?
- Right over there.
- ~~
- Hiya, Barry.
- Well, hello, Ben.
I'm glad you dropped in.
That section of land next to yours is open now, if you want it.
I came to sell you my place.
Still want to buy it?
You didn't seem to think my price was right.
Well, I changed my mind.
- ~~
- One old-fashioned with scotch and a brandy and soda.
Honey, I've got something big this time- bigger than you can imagine.
No, Nardo, I'm all through with that sort of thing.
Just count me out.
But, honey, don't get me wrong.
We've got enough to last us for the rest of our lives- one million dollars.
It's what I've always wanted.
And when I got it, I came for you.
How did you get it?
Look, sweetheart.
It was knowing about my deals that got you that jail term.
I don't want it to happen again.
Nobody can ever harm you for something you don't know.
But this is all wrapped up.
It's okay, it's safe and it's clean.
- And the police are after you.
- No, no.
That's the beauty of it.
Nobody's after me.
The police are after a bundle of money, but they don't know who's got it.
No description, no photograph, no nothing.
Just a big bundle of beautiful bills with Ben Franklin's picture on 'em.
That's why you wanted Ben to take you across the border- so you could get away with it, huh?
Well, Ben or anybody else.
I wanted Ben because I wanted his wife.
But for the money I'm willing to pay, we can hire another guide.
- We?
- Who else?
It was always "we."
Always will be.
Come on.
Drink your drink.
We'll make a fresh start, honey.
- Your dinner's ready, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, honeybunch, let's drink up, and tell me what's bothering you, huh?
It's Ben.
You mean that farmer?
I thought you were walking out on him anyhow.
Well, I did, but I'm not sure I should have.
You know, if it weren't for Ben, you know where I'd be now.
But why worry about it, honey?
You don't love the guy.
No, but I like him.
That's pretty important.
What about me?
I guess I love you, Nardo.
I've tried not to.
I
- I thought I was all over it, but I-
I guess I was wrong.
The minute I saw your face, it all came back to me.
Well, you're like something I've caught... and can't quite cure myself of.
I'll get another guide to take us across.
We'll be out of here before morning.
No, we've got to see Ben first-you and I.
Okay.
I don't relish the prospect... but if that's what you want, that's the way it's going to be.
Let's go now and get it over.
- Hi, Fred.
- Hi, Ben.
- Can I look at that?
- Sure.
212, huh?
She ain't up there, Ben.
Where is she?
She left a couple of minutes ago.
- With a guy in a sports car?
- Yeah.
That's right, Ben.
Well
- Gives me a chance to do a little drinking, huh?
Right, Ben.
- What'd I do wrong, Officer?
- Nothing, I hope.
Can I see your registration certificate?
I know I didn't run through a stoplight.
Was I going too fast?
Can I see your registration certificate?
Well, if I've broken some traffic law, I'm sorry.
If you won't tell me what I did, just write out the ticket, and let's get it over with.
Well, I'm not police.
I'm border patrol.
- Border patrol.
This far from the border?
- That's right, sir.
Nine miles.
We cover back as far as 20 miles.
At 10 miles, we have quite a few spot checks.
- May I take a look in the trunk?
- The trunk?
Sure.
Right back here.
Do you have the key?
Look, Officer.
It's kind of late, and the lady's married.
I got to get her back home fast.
Can't you sort of forget that you ever saw us?
This is the only service I know of that's absolutely free.
You have no right to search my car without a warrant.
Now, look, mister.
We're looking for something special.
We're covering the border from Brownsville to Tijuana.
Now get that key and get it fast.
Here.
What's the matter?
The border patrol won't give you any trouble.
They're always very nice.
Why didn't you want him to look in the trunk?
He wants me to pull up a little.
Nardo!
Nardo, what have you done?
Meg.
- Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
- Meg, what's wrong with you?
Meg, what's wrong with you?
I was only trying to stop you, honey.
- I thought you were trying to kill me.
- Oh, Meg, sweetheart.
I thought you killed him- I mean, deliberately.
I didn't know the gear was in reverse.
- I promise you I didn't!
- Oh, I know.
Come on.
- Feel better, honey?
- Yes, thanks.
Looks like we'll have to walk.
The rocks have busted the gas tank.
Lee, it's five minutes to 3:00.
Will you put out a missing person's alarm?
Look, Ben.
- You'll only make a fool out of yourself.
She'll show up.
I've been through this before.
You think you're the only guy whose wife steps out on him?
- That isn't funny, Lee.
- Oh, look.
It happens all the time.
Something might've happened to her.
Sheriff, give us a hand here!
- It's Harry Castleton.
- I found him on 26.
Guy... ran over me... twice.
Had a
- Had a... redhead... with him... in a... pink sports car.
On
- On purpose.
Go on, Harry.
Talk!
He can't talk.
He's dead.
Meg!
Meg!
Open the door.
Meg!
He's simply got to take us across now.
We don't dare get another guide.
Meg, open the door!
And another thing.
You never saw me before in your whole life, okay?
- Okay.
- Meg, open the door!
I should've known you'd be with him.
- Get out of here!
- I can't.
My car's bogged down.
You've got a lot more than a car to worry about.
The man you killed has four kids.
That was an accident.
She was there.
She'll tell you.
Get some decent clothes on.
I'm taking you into Arivaca.
- What for?
- So you can tell 'em what you know about this mess.
I can't do that, Ben.
She's right, Cameron.
It was only hit-and-run, but she's an accessory.
Her fingerprints are all over that car, and there's a good chance they're on the body too.
You've got to take us across the border into Mexico.
All she has to do is tell the truth.
I told you to get dressed.
- I won't go, Ben.
I won't!
- Then you'll go as you are.
- No, Ben.
No!
Please let me go!
- Come on.
- No!
Let me go, Ben!
Ben, I'm-
- Cameron!
- Go on and shoot!
You haven't the guts.
- I don't need guts.
I need you.
- You're on your way, baby.
- No, I can't go.
You know I can't!
- Shut up!
- Ben, when I get back there, they'll check on me.
They'll find out I've broken my parole, and I'll spend the next nine years in the penitentiary.
- Can't you learn to keep your mouth shut?
- So that's the way it is.
The lady generates a little heat.
I wondered why you married him.
Now I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Boy- You two really deserve each other.
- You gonna take us or not?
- Ben, you've got to.
How much would you say she was worth?
Well, I offered you $200 before, and you turned it down.
That was before you killed Harry Castleton.
A thousand.
That may be all your stinking carcass is worth.
Look.
What about hers?
Well, you would know more about that than I would.
5,000 for the whole deal.
Nah.
I'd say about, uh, 10.
Ben, I'll go to jail if you don't.
Will ya listen?
She's in it all the way, Cameron.
You wouldn't expect me to put a higher value on your wife than you would yourself.
Don't play around with me, Denning.
I'll turn you both over to the cops.
I believe you would.
- All right. 10,000.
- Cash on the line?
I don't know whether I can trust you.
You might decide to turn me over on this side of the border.
You've got the gun.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Ben, I
- I'm sorry.
Shut up.
I picked a tramp, and I know it.
I wouldn't let a dog spend nine years in jail if I could help it.
Especially for 10,000 bucks.
Oh, look, it's dangerous handling that amount of money.
I'd rather you'd carry it.
I got a feeling I can trust you.
- Uh, you can keep her too.
- I'm gonna take you up on that.
- When do we leave?
- Right now.
You got three minutes to get dressed, pack some grub and join us.
What's in the bag?
Change of underwear.
You must have problems.
Where do you think you're going?
I think I'll ride in the truck with you.
You and Meg are riding in here.
I'm driving the rig.
I don't think so.
I'd rather ride alongside of you.
Look, Mac.
Let's understand each other.
From now on, you do exactly what I tell you to do, and you'll do it on the double.
Because when you stop taking orders, I stop moving.
When I stop moving, you're a gone goose.
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I think it does.
In the trailer.
When the motor starts, turn the lights off.
And keep 'em off.
Here.
You two get some sleep.
I know I can trust you together.
What's, uh-What's that?
Hay?
In case you're interested, your wife's behavior with me tonight has been impeccable.
I'm, uh
- I'm just a farmer, Denning.
I don't know what that word "impeccable" means.
If it means what it sounds like, uh, congratulations.
Any chance of him double-crossing us?
No.
He isn't as experienced at double-crossing as you and I.
He never made a living at it.
Whatever he says he'll do, you can count on it.
He almost made a square out of you, sweetheart.
A slug in my head right now would send 30,000 volts through yours.
Denning-
Don't jump.
Don't move.
You might get hurt.
Don't lift your head.
You'll get an ugly scratch if you do.
What's the beef, Cameron?
- You ever see a knife like this before?
- No, I don't think I have.
We use 'em to stick turkeys with.
She slides in at the base of the throat, moves straight up into the brain.
It's like peeling a banana.
I've done it a million times.
I hope the novelty's worn off by now.
There are gonna be lots of times on this trip when we won't be able to watch each other... like when we're asleep.
I don't like anybody holding a gun on me while I'm driving.
Okay.
You've made your point.
Or any other time!
If that ever happens again, Denning-
From now on, we walk.
Most of the time, straight up.
I'm dumping the trailer and truck over the cliff.
You grab a pack.
Get your stuff together.
Don't take any more than you can carry.
I'm awful sensitive about packing stuff that isn't mine.
- Cameron-
- Yeah?
- Are you sure we can't take this rig any further?
- Yeah.
What if we have to turn back?
If we have to turn back, your buddy'll have more than transportation to worry about.
We'd still have the truck and trailer.
I'm not leaving any road signs behind me.
By the time she hits the bottom of that canyon, she'll be in so many pieces... they won't be able to spot 'em from an airplane.
If there's any danger of the border police getting on our trail, I think we ought to-
I got news for you, Mac.
They're already on our trail.
But can't we at least hide the truck in case we need it later?
If we ever get in a spot where you need this truck to pull you out... you'll be a dead duck anyhow.
You get out on the point and watch her splatter.
Better toss over that case too.
You're not gonna have time to change underwear on this trip.
You just take care of your end.
I'll take care of mine.
You never liked it anyway.
Come on.
It'll take four or five hours to get around this cliff.
We don't have enough daylight.
We'll stay here and wait till morning.
What in tarnation you folks doin' way up here?
Hiya, pop.
Ben Cameron!
- Hiya, Ben.
- Hi.
Hiya, Ms. Cameron.
Phew.
What do you figure doin' up here, son?
Jumpin' my claim?
- No.
I'm just taking this dude hunting.
- Huntin'?
Where's your gun?
Well, we don't need 'em.
- We're
- We're gonna scare the game to death.
- Having a little trouble though.
- Uh-huh.
What's your problem?
Well, we could save time if we had a rope.
- A rope?
- Yeah, to get these two up there.
Well, time's kind of cheap, but, uh, ropes come pretty dear iffen you ain't got one.
- How much?
- How about two dollars?
- I'll give you five.
- Good Lord.
For five, I'll carry you up piggyback.
You wait right here!
There's a rock up there- I used to could hit it first try.
Here, here.
Let me do it.
That's pretty good, boy.
Couldn't have done it much better myself.
I'll do the hauling.
You tie 'em on down here, huh?
Okay, son.
All right, Denning, you go first.
Hey, pop.
Tie the dude on, will ya?
Okay.
Sure hope this holds.
Do you, uh, got that five dollars handy?
Here.
Denning, you just hold on.
I'll pull.
Uh, you just use your feet as much as you can.
Let me down, Cameron!
Wow!
Oh, wow!
Let me down!
Hey!
That's-That's nice underwear you've got.
Man, that's a crazy color.
This is what I've been lookin' for all my life.
I'd sure like to know where your claim is, mister.
- This even feels good!
- I'll take care of it.
- No, no.
Don't mind at all.
Don't mind to help.
- Just take it easy, pop.
I'd like to have this job by the week.
Maybe you will.
Say, uh, where is that claim of yours?
Right over here.
Come on.
I'd like to show it to you.
Take care of this, Meg.
There she be!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You got to play it the way the cards fall.
He'd have told half the state.
- Bury him.
- You're crazy.
Bury him!
Here's your wire from Washington, Captain.
Well, that ought to tie it up, especially with this fingerprint report.
"The prints on Harry Castleton's belt belong to a woman named Margaret Fowler.
"She drew a one-to-10-year rap in Tehachapi for a bunco job.
Out on parole after serving one year."
And her fingerprints match up just fine with Ben Cameron's wife.
You don't think Ben's mixed up in this, do you?
The dame's messed up in it bad.
That dress was found in their cabin.
As for Ben, why not?
He sold his place and moved out the night of the murder.
Ben was with me when Harry Castleton was brought in.
So Cameron helps his wife out of a jam.
After her two-timing him with that fancy Dan?
That's the kind of a guy Ben is.
Yeah, it figures, all right.
If I know Ben, and I think I do, I know just where he's gonna try to cross over.
- Which way?
- The right.
- Why don't you take the lead?
- If I'm gonna be shot, I want to see it comin'.
Go ahead.
You, uh- You a music lover, Denning?
No, but I'm a sucker for police broadcasts.
I'll give you two about an hour.
- For what?
- To rest.
Then we start out again.
You mean we're gonna travel tonight?
All night.
Aren't you pushing things a little hard, Cameron?
Your wife's kind of tired.
You can carry her pack.
We have all day tomorrow for sleeping.
I can walk right alongside of you night and day, Cameron.
I'd just like to know the reason why.
We have to cross the upper end of the Papago Reservation.
If we try it by daylight, we'll be spotted.
We have to make it tonight.
Sounds reasonable.
Just how far are we from the border?
Too far.
I'm gonna take a look for the best way down.
I'll be back.
I'm sorry about what happened back there with the old man, honey.
I had to do it.
He'd have talked.
You know that, don't you?
- Sure.
He'd have talked.
- And that would've been the end of it.
They'd have picked us up in 24 hours.
You'd have gone back to jail.
Me too.
We might never have gotten together again.
- So we had to kill him.
- Sure.
And the man we ran over- It wasn't an accident, was it?
- We had to kill him too, didn't we?
- Now, look here, sweetheart.
The first thing they teach you in the Marine Corps is to cover yourself.
You come first.
It's got to be that way.
You make it sound like a virtue... as if it were our Christian duty to kill anyone that gets in our way.
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get this "our" business?
You had nothing to do with it.
We're a team, aren't we?
It's never been you or me.
It's always been us.
And it always will be us.
Don't think of the past, sweetheart.
Think of the future.
Think of us together... once we get rid of that husband of yours.
- What do you mean, get rid of him?
- Wait a minute, honey.
I'm no gun-crazy killer.
I don't go out looking for trouble.
I've got nothing against Cameron.
As far as I can see, I never should have.
But you said "get rid of him."
I meant when we get across the border.
I'll pay him off, I'll tell him about us... and that's all there'll be to it.
Nardo, get the $10,000.
Put it on his pack so he'll find it when he gets back.
- What does that get us?
- It'll get us out of here.
We don't need him anymore.
- You mean, we're already across the border?
- No, but we're very close to it.
How close?
- Remember what Ben said about the Papago Reservation?
- Yeah.
Well, we've been there- Ben and I.
It's a long, narrow valley dotted with little Indian farms.
The border's just the other side of it- down there.
- How far would you guess?
- Five miles.
Maybe less.
Then we don't need Ben.
We can make it alone.
After you've put the money on the pack.
Let's go, honey.
This is something we waited for for three years.
Listen.
We've never quite been able to get away from San Francisco, have we?
I don't want to get away from it- not that part of it.
I want to get away from the rest of it.
Honey, we're all through taking the suckers.
We're all through scrounging for money.
From now on, it's gonna be just you... and me.
- Get what you need.
Let's get off the road.
Get gun.
Help!
Help, somebody!
Help!
- What's the matter with you?
What are you trying to do to me?
Don't get scared, son.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Nice cow.
You pay.
Drop the gun, Denning.
Pick it up.
Give it to me.
- Pay the boy for the cow.
- How much?
Five of those bills you got in your pocket.
- $500?
- Yeah.
We were hunting out on the reservation by mistake.
- You won't tell, huh?
- No.
Here's your gun.
We won't cause you any more trouble.
Let's go back and pick up the gear you left.
Why don't we go on across the border?
I'll be on my way.
How close to the border you think we are?
I thought about five miles.
Five miles?
Why do you look at her?
Is that what she told you?
How would she know?
She's never been here before.
We've got a good two days' hike to cross over.
Why'd you do it, Meg?
Because something's happened to you, Nardo.
Something terrible.
I thought the first one was an accident.
But now I know it wasn't.
- You're a killer.
- That still makes us a team.
I do my own killing.
You want a judge to do yours.
Ben, I
- I should have told you this before.
- This is-
- I know who he is.
She kept your picture.
She was pretty crazy about you.
- I guess she still is.
- Yeah, sure.
Just hope she doesn't get that crazy about you, Cameron.
Because you'll watch her the rest of your life.
What they've done once, they'll do again.
Let's get going.
Okay, we'll stop here.
We can sleep till noon.
You go down there.
We'll stay here.
Here, I'll take that.
Ben?
- Ben.
- Hmm.
Ben, I-
I'm no good, Ben.
I'm no good for anybody.
He still loves me, and I tried to raise the whole countryside so he'd be caught.
Almost did.
I never saw anybody so anxious to get back to the penitentiary.
Why'd you do it?
He wanted to kill you.
Well, we have a lot in common.
I want to kill him.
I'm cured of him, Ben.
Yeah?
Maybe.
There's no maybe about it.
When your blood turns cold and you can't bear the thought of him touching you, you're cured.
Let's leave here, Ben.
Let's leave here and go back to home.
It's not that easy.
You're mixed up in two murders.
There'd be too much explaining.
Besides, I want to be around when Denning dies.
Ben-
That's the way it is.
You mean you'd kill him?
Look.
I've got a rifle wrapped up in this blanket.
Do you know why?
If I didn't, I'd kill him a hundred times a day.
Not for the money?
No, not- not just for the money.
If the money's there, I'm not gonna walk away from it.
How's your arm?
It's swelling a little.
It hurts.
It's bound to.
Go on.
Go and get some sleep.
- What's the matter, Meg?
- My arm.
Too painful!
Honey
- Honey, you have a fever.
- Why didn't you tell me, huh?
- I didn't know.
Come on.
We'll find shelter in that cave.
Can you make it?
Sit down.
Here, let me help.
Let me look at that arm.
How is it?
It's
- It's not good.
- Is it
- Is it infected?
- You should have told me.
Everything's soaked.
Hey, don't get too comfortable.
We're gathering wood.
You gather it.
If he makes a wrong move, shoot him.
I got to have something dry to start it with.
Fat chance.
You got anything that might be dry?
It's been raining just as hard on me as it has on you.
All right, Denning.
Give it to me.
- You're crazy.
- I've got to boil some water.
She's got an armful of gangrene.
Give me my 10 grand.
9,500.
You bought a cow, don't forget.
Do you think she'd burn up $ 10,000 on you?
I can't believe you're a natural-born fool.
You must have trained for it.
Here.
Keep your eye on him.
The wood's drier now.
The next batch oughta do it.
All right, Denning, let's- let's have some more.
No.
I'll never have a better excuse for killing you.
That's what you'll have to do.
Don't move.
Meg, the rifle.
I'm afraid I'll miss.
Meg, you won't miss.
I might hit you.
You won't hit me.
Just... cock the hammer... and aim like I taught you.
- Good try.
- Thanks.
And thank you.
Here, baby.
Come on.
Good girl.
Here.
You lie down.
I'll have a fire going in a jiffy.
Come on.
One thing I gotta say for us, we sure got money to burn.
By the way, Denning, where'd you get this stuff, huh?
Oh, a fellow I know left it with me.
He was a little hot, so I held it until he cooled off.
So when he came back, you- you just weren't there, huh?
That's right.
He, uh, didn't know you very well, did he?
Oh, he knew me very well.
He was my best friend.
All right, baby, come on.
Turn over, huh?
Easy.
That's it.
I'm just gonna cut away your sleeve.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, baby.
Raise up a little.
That's it.
All right, baby, this is gonna be hot now.
Easy.
Easy, honey.
Easy.
That's it.
That's it.
Now, baby, this is gonna hurt.
Now, you just yell as much as you want, huh?
I know.
I know, baby.
Easy.
That's all, honey.
There.
That's it, baby.
Easy.
Now, easy.
That's it.
That's my girl.
It's all over now, honey.
It's all over, baby.
That's it.
It's all over, baby.
Now the dead flesh is cut away, the pain goes awfully fast.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I had to hurt you, Meg.
What are you so nervous about?
I'm just gonna go out and get some firewood.
You know, if you were on a desert island with that guy... and there was nothing there but rocks... pretty soon he'd have all the rocks moved to his side of the beach.
How do you feel, huh?
- Lots better.
- Sure.
You'll be on your feet by the time this storm peters out.
- Ben.
- Yeah?
If
- If I were to go back to jail, would you wait for me?
Honey, till you're a little old, old lady.
Let's go back to the ranch.
Well, I haven't got a ranch.
I
- I sold it.
- Sold it?
- Yeah, to Floyd Barry.
- Sold it when?
- Night I came to town to pick you up.
But-You-You loved that scraggly old piece of desert.
Nah, I was getting a bellyful of it.
Besides, I figured it was either you or the ranch... and I
- I reckon I liked you best.
Oh, Ben, I-I'm scared.
Ben, l-let's tell him he can have all the money.
Look, honey, we've witnessed two murders.
He's got to try to kill us.
Money isn't the point anymore.
Except that you think you're going to end up with all of it.
I'm not gonna leave it there for the coyotes.
We're all fouled up, honey.
We gotta have money to stay clear.
Not that kind, Ben.
What-What can you do with it, except run for the rest of your life?
Me, honey?
I'd buy you things.
Buy you some new shoes.
I'd buy you 300 pink dresses.
Pardon me.
Maybe I should have knocked.
- How's the weather outside?
- Wet.
I think I'll take a light from your fire.
Hey, that'll cost you 25,000.
A little more than I can afford.
Besides, the storm is clearing up anyway.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking what a fool I am... trying to stay awake to watch you.
You're the one who has to do the watching, not I.
Good night, Cameron.
Too bad you can't join me in pleasant dreams.
Ben, I'm cold.
Is that better?
Look.
It's still raining in San Felipe.
How far away is that storm?
About four miles.
San Felipe's 10 miles south of the border.
Yeah.
That puts me in Mexico right now.
Since, uh, yesterday.
- Meg, come down here.
- Stay there.
You think I won't?
I think you will.
But she stays there.
Get away from him.
Get away from him.
No, Nardo!
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna use any ammunition I might need later on.
What do you think your chances are of getting out of here?
About 60-40... maybe a little less.
A lot less.
You're through, Cameron.
- So are you, if you stay with him.
- Worry about yourself.
I'll be all right.
I don't have an infected arm.
I don't have my leg covered in rocks.
But I do have a gun, so I'll eat.
I can't miss so long as I keep heading' south.
- What do you think?
- Yeah, you stand a pretty good chance.
My chances would be a lot better if you give me some instructions.
I'll do better than give you instructions.
I'll give you a choice.
Down this canyon, about two and a half miles... you come to a road.
It goes to the left.
You follow that road, you'll come to a little...
Indian village called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10... tell them where we are.
They'll come and help us.
You'd do as much for me, I suppose?
That's neither here nor there.
The only trouble with Santa Isabel, it's... in the opposite direction to where you want to go.
That's what I figured.
Your other choice is- when you get to the road, you look to the right.
You'll see the Lagos de Zapitan.
They have an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could- you could be on your way to Mexico City.
I like that better.
Why don't you tell her to come along with me?
She needs a doctor.
No reason for you both to die here... unless you want it that way.
It makes a crazy kind of sense, Meg.
- Better pack your stuff and go with him.
- No.
- We haven't got a 50-to-1 chance.
- I don't care if it's a hundred to nothing.
I'm staying right here.
You'd rather have him dead than me alive?
That's exactly what I mean.
I should have killed him while I had the rifle on him.
Meg, get a- get a stick or something.
Scoop the dirt from under the rock.
They haven't counted us out yet.
I'm gonna track him down.
I'm gonna track him down and kill him.
Can't let a guy like that go on living.
You'll come to a little Indian village... called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10, they'll come and get us.
Your other choice is- you look to the right.
You'll see the Lagos de Zapitan.
They've got an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could be on your way to Mexico City.
Some mo- more, Meg.
Under my-
- What's the matter, baby?
- Ben, I've got to stop.
I can't go any further.
Oh, come on.
Just-Just a little farther, huh, honey?
Come on.
Just-Just- Just a little ways more, huh?
We'll bed down for the night in that- that canyon ahead, huh?
Come on.
That's a girl.
Stop!
- I see no one.
- Pa, look.
The river's full of money!
- What if the police come?
- The police?
Get into the truck.
Into the truck.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Meg.
- Meg.
Meg.
- Hmm?
Hmm.
- Look up there.
- Where?
- What is it?
- Meg... it's a hundred dollar bill.
It's wet.
It came from the stream.
Meg
- Meg... the stream is full of money.
Something's happened to Denning.
Ben!
You're not after the man now, you're after the money.
Meg, stay back!
It's Denning, He's
- He's all torn up.
There's a road up there.
Then he wasn't heading for Lagos de Zapitan?
He was headed for Santa Isabel.
He was going for help.
How do you like that?
Probably the first decent thing he's done in years... and he gets himself knocked off for it.
- I'm sorry, Ben, but I just-
- It's all right, honey.
Go on.
Go on.
Cry.
The guy loved you.
Didn't want you to die.
He deserves a few tears.
It's all right, baby.
Come on, Meg.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go home, huh, baby?
Let's go home and face the music, huh?
La Vie financière, please.
Thanks.
Hullo, is that the police?
There's a holdup happening on the Rue de la Grange aux Belles.
Louis, we better ditch the car.
Louis, not there, eh.
Get onto the sidewalk, f' Chrissake
Are you gonna shut up?
Do we split now?
Hang on.
Why?
Wait for the others.
OK, Pépito, open 'em up.
Count it.
15 million.
How does that divvy up?
3 million each.
3 each?
Not more.
We gotta pay the guy who fixed the job.
But not a whole share.
Yeah.
That was the agreement with the guy.
I'll take it to him this afternoon.
How can we be sure of that?
You're the only one who knows him.
What are you getting at?
So you don't trust my word?
You're forgetting I'm the one who sets up the jobs.
I'm taking the most risk.
The guy has never seen you, while I... if he squeals...
You could also chicken out and talk.
You were shitting yourself in the car.
Take that back, Raymond, or...
Frédo, I swear you have all the nerve of an old woman.
Is this a stick-up?
Whadda you wanna say?
Don't get mad with me.
It must be stress...
or nerves...
like you say.
No, Pépito.
No.
You dare... pull a gun on us!
This time we'll give you a break.
Raymond, you go along to help with the payment.
You bet!
Else he just might think about screwing us.
Beat it.
We're getting behind.
For tonight, it still stands?
Yeah, at the bar as usual.
Whadda you think of Frédo?
That's what.
I couldn't risk letting you bump off someone who'd stuck his neck out for us.
And it's the first time he's cracked.
You'd probably come unstuck if you had all his money.
Come off it!
You going to your hotel?
I'd better swing past the 'van.
I haven't seen the kids in a month.
I should give them some money.
Say hi to your wife for me.
Come for a bite some evening.
Dolorès'll do us a sheep's head.
You off to the track, this afternoon?
Oh... shit!
What's up?
I was given a sure thing for the fourth race.
I'll go to the 'van after.
Rubbish.
Drop by the caravan first and leave a little moolah.
Divvy up soon, right ?
The deal's still on?
Frédo's not gonna spill his guts?
He's too fond of dough to do that.
He'll come...trust him.
See you.
OK.
Hey!
tell me....
Would that be your winner?
This is crazy!
Someone's stolen my scarf!
We'll find it for you.
I hope so.
It's the new style fom Hermès.
There's the boss.
You can tell him.
What's going on?
Someone's stolen madame's check scarf.
You're going to say it's not true.
I'll deal with it.
I've told you not to forget things in the car.
I assure you that it was there yesterday.
I'll pay for another one.
Are you dining with me tonight?
No.
I've got a meeting.
Not with another woman?
Yes.
An infant.
Anyway, see you tomorrow.
You want me to wear my blue dress?
I've had a new slip made.
Don't let that get stolen.
She's not bad, eh?
I'm admiring your garage.
You may.
It cost me enough.
The pneumatic hoist, same cost as my appartment.
It wasn't fenced?
I needed to modernise a bit.
Between the brickies and the plumbers, that's where it all goes.
It's not going badly over there.
You want to see the accounts.
Not now.
I'm on my way to the bar Come along.
It's a bit heavy, but correct.
We'll see.
Like you say, it's heavy.
I couldn't let myself be rushed by the Maltese.
He wanted to buy the land It would have looked good.
2 nightclubs side by side.
Talk about competition.
Here we're the kings of the sticks.
Now we can expand.
What are we looking for for this work?
2.5 million pesos.
Where do you want me to take it?
Last time in Caracas I gave you 10.
Wait a sec.
The main thing, is that you agree.
This is money for jam.
This is good for your friend Fredo.
That old rascal, it must be 10 years since I saw him.
As mean as ever?
He won't end up poor.
Always the miser.
And his floozy?
Nowadays his floozy is a respectable lady:
Shack in the suburbs, slippers by the fire, mass on Sundays.
You know the type?
She's certainly changed.
In the past, she wasn't such a bad-mouth.
As you get older you whitewash yourself.
A christening?
No, a bit of a party.
You gotta stay...you can see your old pal,
You'll find he's changed.
Once upon a time, a veritable lion.
I think your lion has lost his mane.
How many bottles have you put on ice?
These here.
And there are others.
'Evening all.
This is all I got to bring back.
Hi, Linotte.
The American!
How's it going?
Salut, Antoine.
So you had your beard trimmed?
I was robbed.
Bonsoir, Frédo.
- I'm happy to see you.
Payday, eh?
.
You haven't changed.
Just a bit of a stomach.
When he came to New York every time a Yank spoke, he asked me:
"What did he say ?"
Old scoundrel.
Excuse me a minute.
See you all later.
It's done.
I took the guy his dough.
Good-oh!
I'm gonna check out the kitchen.
Set a place for me.
I'm invited.
Antoine, there needs to be flowers here.
We do have florists.
You were forgetting I'm with a lady?
Frédo...
There, Grenouille, go and find us some flowers.
10 thou'?
Flowers are expensive in winter.
Bonsoir, maman.
Bonsoir, Louis.
Bonsoir, madame Frédo.
Hortense!
We're not getting any younger...eh?
Delighted to see you again.
Bonsoir, madame Frédo.
I'll be damned...it's Hortense!
You're right.
Madame Frédo, my homages.
May I present...
Madame "Whats-her-name", and madame...
Monsieur Pépito, manners, please!
.
Dinner is served, ladies.
Mme Frédo will place the table.
Louis, on my left,
Zé on my right, and Madame opposite me.
Well I never!
It was dusty.
You'll need to do your housework.
Voilà, my beauty.
Don't be backward, take the biggest ones.
This is not Maxim's!
You're not in the back of a truck either, monsieur Pépito.
Frédo, tell your broad to clam up.
Don't answer that.
Leave it alone.
Mademoiselle, the lemon, please.
Louis, pass me a little butter.
You haven't tried sea-urchins, Antoine?
It's no time to be outside.
Grenouille, go and draw the curtains.
You too, sweetie.
- Who's serving the drinks?
Hervieux.
-Who is it?
It's me, Hélène.
Open the door.
Oh, it's you!
You're soaking wet.
What have you been up to?
It wasn't very wise to come here.
I haven't seen you for 2 months.
Not there...you'll stain my floor.
Then go and have a wash...you're all muddy.
It's not my fault I've been slaving in the workshop.
I've been at it for a while now.
In six months I'll be living in Paris with a cleaner job.
I think of you, you know.
I've already put aside 30 thousand for your coat.
"30000"...
I won't be getting the astrakhan I spotted in a hurry
Wouldn't you rather golden-sheepskin?
It'd make you look young.
Turn off the light.
We make a good couple.
Don't worry my darling.
Our worries will soon be over.
I'll quit nights and be able to spoil you a bit more.
I'm going to join with my brother in his garage.
Nothing'll keep us apart.
I'll move in here.
Whadda you thinking?
About what you're saying.
You're right.
I think the golden-sheepskin would suit me better.
Hélène, wake up.
It's six o'clock...my train's at 7.
I gotta hurry.
Don't leave me alone too long without me hearing from you.
You don't need to get up, darling.
I've got to close the door.
There, monsieur.
He's here.
Hey there!
Whadda you doing?
Take it easy, Pierre Bertain.
Quietly.
You want to go to HQ sir?
No.
Go to the nearest station.
Half an hour to go til we're relieved.
You been whooping it up all night!
Shuddup.
Good morning gentlemen.
This is for us?
See y'all later.
Siddown.
So, you're hoofing it around Paris without permission?
You know the penalty?
Infraction of your parole restrictions:
2 or 3 months.
I was on my way to go back by the 7 o'clock train.
Gimme a break.
Lemme keep going.
2 or 3 months?
More.
Especially if there are false papers.
Have you got your area restriction passbook?
Good, that's it.
He's OK on that side.
Let's see what's in there.
- Not bad at all!
- You didn't have a boring night!
We'll prepare your deposition sheet.
There are no forms here, in this dump.
It's not a good idea to let this slide.
If he wasn't such an idiot, he could get back to her.
But as we see, that's not possible.
The guy'll be pulled in at the depot.
Of course, but...
But what?
Dunno... he might be given a permit to move around.
With a police assistance pass.
That's right, sir.
With one of those, he could circulate freely.
I didn't think of that.
Did you here that?
That you can walk out of here free?
"Free"?
Just that, free.
And even better, free to remain in Paris.
Are you just trying to wind me up?
That's not very nice.
Why would you let me go?
What do I have to do?
Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Just give us 1 or 2 tips.
You should be well acquainted with a few thieves?
You've perhaps heard talk about a successful job.
or something along those lines.
At Lagny, I didn't go to bars where crims meet .
But who said anything about Lagny?
We're after stuff from Paris and Montmartre.
Your brother's friends, for example
We're not after stuff on your brother, we know he's sweet.
The ones we're interested in are his friends.
If you say the word, we'll sign a piece of paper, and in 15 minutes, you'll be home with your doll.
You can stay there.
No need to return to Lagny.
Isn't that a great program?
I've nothing to tell you.
If that's the way you want it.
Ok sign this.
He'll take the 11 o'clock wagon.
Come on.
Sign here.
You're not a bit daft?
Don't you want to be released I can tell you nothing,
I know nothing.
If you come back to Paris, you know my conditions.
To get me, phone HQ.
Turbigo 9200.
Extension 907.
Ask for officer Pluvier.
Get in there.
Move it, you too.
You going to keep me long?
The superintendent will decide.
You wanna 'nother bowl ... wake you up?
Yeah.
You seem out of sorts.
With the life you lead...
I heard you come in.
The clock said 5.
I was out on a bender with friends.
Nightclub mania... y' know how it is.
Haven't you had enough, of that din?
You know, in the 50 years I've been here...
Just say the word and I'll buy you a house in the country.
At least you'll be peaceful.
You've put all your money into your garage.
There's some left for me.
It's always there for you.
I ask myself just how you do it.
That's about business, that is.
Your brother had "business", too.
You know what that led to!
He can't even live here any more.
Don't bring this up with me.
13 months in the can and 5 years stick for some tires...
But I have some well-placed friends who are gonna try and have his ban lifted.
You think they can?
I hope so.
It's a question of dough.
If they succeed, I'll have him in my garage garage.
To stop the stuff-ups.
Exactly, he wrote me.
He'd like to see that happen.
Will you take me along?
You expecting someone?
Who's there?
Pierre Bertain has given me a message for his mother.
Come in.
Who is it?
A faggot, maman.
A what?
Pierrot has sent us a faggot.
Curious way of announcing me.
Your from Lagny?
Why "Lagny"?
Where have you seen my brother?
Just at the police station.
Had he been arrested?
Yes.
He takes the 11am wagon.
Then?
This morning he was taken to a security cell.
I want you to know that I am victim of a miscarriage of justice.
Last night I found myself near a public convenience, the police have conclu...
And my brother?
Your brother asked me to warn you:
He was sent to the depot.
Where did they pick him up?
Near Avenue Bolivar.
Good.
I'm grateful.
Au revoir, madame.
Take it.
I was just doing a favor.
Take it.
You can buy yourself a new handbag.
Au revoir.
Thanks.
Buck up, Maman.
They'll watch him a fortnight...a month at the most.
What was he doing up to at Avenue Bolivar?
How would I know?
I've got it!
Hélène!
Still with that piece of....?
I forbad him see her, the little jerk!
Louis!
I'd like to know what she's up to!
I should go.
I'm late.
Clémence will be waiting for me.
That kid!
That kid!
Bye, big-boy.
Don't you worry, eh.
Bonjour, Louis.
A pack of Chesterfields?
Cheers, Louis.
Gimme some change, Maurice.
That's for 100 balls.
Have one, Bébert?
I've given up.
You're right, it stunts your growth.
Hey, you're gonna blow all your dough on that contraption
Here, have a game on me.
Thanks, Louis.
It's not for seeing girls with.
What do take me for?
But one like your brother's...
That'd be freaky.
You better believe it.
'bye, boys.
Cheerio.
Get your oranges!
They're beautiful!
Oranges, oranges!
Buy my oranges, they're so good!
'Til this evening, maman.
See you then.
'bye Clémence.
Beautiful oranges!
Buy my oranges!
Who wants oranges?
Finest oranges!
Is that OK, sir?
Thanks.
Do you need to know someone long before accepting an invitation?
I'm leaving Paris tomorrow.
I'd like to take you to lunch.
It'd be a change for me from a business lunch.
Don't you trust me?
Yes.
So what's stopping you?
I've got a date.
Is he young?
Yes.
Handsome?
Yes.
Is he rich?
His father is.
Who are the chocolates for?
The gentlemen opposite.
Here you are, monsieur.
Put them there.
Excuse me.
What do I owe you?
6000 francs, monsieur.
Keep the change.
Merci, monsieur.
Is there no way at all to arrange this lunch?
The thing is, he'll be waiting for me in his car.
Like every Wednesday.
And if I should have a word with this young man?
There, my sweet, your tip.
It's a green car.
Fine.
With the manicure, 1500.
You've struck it lucky.
It doesn't happen to me.
He's so distinguished.
Pardon, monsieur.
I'm a friend of Hélène's.
She won't be able to have lunch with you today, she's lunching with me.
She would have warned me.
I arrived unexpectedly.
She'll tell me herself.
She's asked me to let you know.
What are you getting at?
That you should beat it.
And at full speed.
Whadda you mean?
but, monsieur...
I'm not your "sieur".
He was charming.
How about lunch at the Cascade?
Fine.
You don't live in Paris?
No, I'm just here 2 days a month.
What do you do exactly?
I'm in business.
How about we take a bit of a walk to work up an appetite?
OK?
OK.
They're lucky to be able to do that.
I would have loved to do horse-riding.
Have you done it?
Yes, in the artillery.
You have a pretty laugh.
I don't often get a chance to be happy.
But with you I feel good.
Are you cold?
A bit.
You don't have a fur?
Not yet.
But I think I'm going to get one.
But I'm tossing up between an astrakan and a golden-sheepskin.
In your place I wouldn't hesitate.
I'd get a mink.
Apart from the youngster in the car, anyone else?
No.
A woman always needs a man to help her.
But to find one, one I'd want...
You slut!
You've never heard of Pierre Bertain?
He's made enough mistakes, without a whore like you.
I forbid you to see him again, you understand?
I forbid you!
You did say Industrial and Commercial Bank, one Pug 203, blue panelvan body?
Armored?
No.
Number 8021 BA 78, leaves Dourdan at 2pm towards Étampes.
You're sure they'll go past there?
Sure.
Are they sweet peas?
In 2 months they'll be up here.
I treat mine with compost.
You're doing right, there.
On the whole you gain with that.
We'll see.
The cost isn't the same.
The cost shouldn't stop you.
And still we talk about the high life.
If we're stuck we can always fence a few gold coins.
That'd be painful.
They've gone up 40 points.
If I'd heard about it I would have bought Suez Canal.
I'd be fixed for winter.
Suez, OK.
But phosphates?
Have you seen how much they are?
27,000.
I thought you paid 30 for them.
Didn't you tell me that?
Whose been kidding you?
I never said that
It's not something to joke about.
Did you get a flat?
Yes.
Thorn, stone...
I dunno.
What's going on with Toto?
It's easier to manage amateurs here than at the Melbourne Games.
There, they've got it!
Oh, to be young again.
Come through here, maman.
You'll have the usual.
A Malaga for my mother and two small Ricards.
We'll lunch at a bistro I know.
I'll get a table.
You've got news from Hélène?
No.
She hasn't replied to my letters.
Perhaps she hasn't had time.
She would've been able to give me some sign of life.
You can always find time to write.
And she doesn't work Mondays.
We'll be there in 20 minutes.
Thanks.
After lunch we'll get you some new duds.
Sound good?
I thought we'd be going to the garage.
We'll go to the garage afterwards .
Look at him.
He sees himself in a collar and tie already .
Cheers!
Happy now?
And how!
Wish I was there.
I've got a surprise.
I've made your favorite dish for tonight.
Beef stew?
I've got a business dinner this evening.
I've a client.
Of course, my son.
Maman, if Louis's not coming, you know what I'd like?
You want me to dine alone?
Ah well, off you go.
I'll tell him you've gone dancing.
Au revoir, Hélène.
Rock'n'roll's fab.
My feet go wild.
Cha-cha's better.
It's more exciting.
Au revoir.
Au revoir.
Thursday, then?
She's not bad.
You're talking about Prince Charming.
Jacques, you'll get jealous!
Can I come up?
I don't want to find myself in the Bois de Boulogne woods.
Whadda you mean?
Ask your brother.
Bravo!
The romance didn't last long, Jacques!
Your chances are coming back.
Bonsoir, monsieur.
Sleep well.
Have fun!
Au revoir.
Yesterday Mimile phoned Fredo.
Some heavies are driving with the loot.
We'll have to take the risk.
You take the risk if there's no other way.
Why's it brought forward?
They don't want to keep the money in the bank over the holiday.
They say it's not a good idea.
Otherwise nothing's changed?
No.
Except that it's for tomorrow.
That's it...
The delivery van'll leave Dourdan at 2pm.
What the hell are you doing here?
I thought you'd gone dancing.
You hear me?
So answer.
You've heard what was said?
No, Louis.
I was taking a nap.
Louis...
Take it from me, Pépito.
You'll see, you're wrong.
That's true isn't it?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Keep cool.
'Til tomorrow.
Don't forget to warn The Sailor.
Pierre, You have heard, haven't you?
No, no.
Pierre...
Swear to me you'll speak to no one.
But I haven't heard anything.
Swear, I'm telling you.
I swear it, Louis.
On what?
On our mother's head.
What?
That I will speak to no one.
Good.
Why did you come back so early?
I gave you enough to play with.
I wasn't in the mood.
You wanted to see Hélène again.
You've been to see that slag?
I won't have you call her that.
And what's the story about the Bois de Boulogne woods?
Because your mother hasn't told you Hélène was less than nothing?
Answer my question!
I forbid you to chase after that screwed up...!
Louis!
Have you no shame?
Your little brother?
Louis!
Are you crazy?
Scram, bikes are coming.
Come on, Raymond.
We'll have to fix them, now.
Bravo, Raymond.
The other one.
You see, Louis?
Whadda you waiting for?
Raymond!
Frédo, your go, go on!
Piece of shit!
Don't!
In half an hour we'll be at the hideout.
Hang in there.
The bullet holes will make us obvious.
We'll need new wheels.
There's a farm.
Don't shoot, you shit!
Stop, you arsehole!
We gotta torch the wagon.
His helmet saved his life.
And the first man?
He'll make it.
Oh!
You alone?
Mimile had a nose for it.
The 60 seem to be there.
What's he up to, Frédo?
Have you ever seen him miss the split, that one?
When I think what he made us today.
We'll split The Sailor's share That'll make half a mill times three.
But surely not a full share for Frédo?
For that shit.
For the last time, I'll be straight with him.
You want to send him packing?
No.
I'm starting to admit failure.
I've decided to stop.
Whadda 'bout me?
You can find another gang.
Whatta you gonna do?
Take a trip.
"Travelling"?
Yep.
I wonder what a new life can give.
What are you doing there?
Your golden-sheepskin.
That's nice.
Come in.
Put it on the table.
Quickly...open it.
Thank you.
Help me put it on.
I wanna know, about the Bois de Boulogne woods.
Haven't had an answer.
Don't raise that ever again.
Pass me my scarf.
With this coat...
Hélène...
What happened?
Nothing.
He came to invite me out, supposedly to speak about you.
We were close by the Cascade restaurant...
It was nothing.
No, go on.
Just that, nothing.
He made some... propositions.
He got fresh, then I slapped him.
Is that all it was that he refused to tell me?
Take it easy.
We won't talk about it.
Go sit down.
I'll just be a minute.
It really suits me you know.
I'd like to keep it for...
Hullo?
Yes, it's me.
He's certainly not here.
I thought he was with you.
He hasn't gone home.
When your nerves crack, you can expect anything.
Maybe he's hiding in a corner somewhere
D'you think he's going to forget ... this?
We gotta know where he's been.
If we can't find out, we go to his place.
OK.
We'll meet downstairs at my place at 9 o'clock.
Nine o'clock?
What's the matter with you?
You're cold.
Are you sick?
No.
You're keeping something from me.
Tell me what it is.
Nothing.... promise.
What is it?
I swear...you're imagining things.
If you can't trust me, it's pointless you staying here.
You can get out then.
Pierre!
Darling, tell me what's making you so unhappy.
Hélène, if you knew...
Hélène, it was my brother who pulled the Dourdan job.
They robbed a bank and killed two guys.
Freeze!
You seen le Blond?
We were to meet at 9.
Don't bother waiting.
The cops hauled him off.
Oh, Mi-Fa-Sol!
I'm gonna need you.
OK...
I've got a run to do.
I'll explain in the car.
OK.
You'll soon be able to sign.
"Sign"?
I'm innocent.
You think I'm guilty?
A burglar, me?
You're kidding.
But you admitted tonight...
Mind you don't get a stroke.
Well, we'll see.
Be sensible.
You're going to make a mistake.
Sign here as you promised.
What...!
Did I say that?
Well?
You going to stuff us around for long
Speak up!
...
you hear me?
We know everything.
We know who sold you out.
So ask them.
We're tougher than you.
And you'll fold, I guarantee.
Raoul, bring in you know what.
So... what do you think of that?
Pretty, eh?
I told you we're the hard men.
Give in!
And tell us where to find The Gypsy.
You're making us waste time.
Out with it!
Take a photo.
It's part of the loot.
It was found at his place.
His mother's here.
She followed us.
She hopes to see him.
No way.
She seems prepared to wait.
Let her wait.
Here's another headache for you.
You're done for.
Come on, admit it.
The jury'll give you a break.
Stop it.
I've no idea what you're talking about.
If you tell us where The Gypsy is, you'll be better off.
Word of honor.
- You're dummer than I thought.
But you'll come round.
Look who's in my office.
Out here!
What'd I tell you?
Happy to see your old friend?
i don't know this guy.
You can stop your performance.
Who were you with at Dourdan?
I'm waiting.
With Raymond, The Gypsy... and Louis.
Who gave you the job?
Émile, who runs a bar on the Dourdan road.
10 million was for him.
Who hit the motorcyclists?
The Gypsy and The Sailor.
Who decided to throw The Sailor out onto the road?
Louis.
Who stuck up the bank?
We did.
Who came here to HQ this morning?
Who asked to see me?
Who fingered the whole gang?
I didn't want to, Louis.
I had to.
I was scared, scared, scared.
Can you understand?
I was at my wit's end.
I was terrified of you, The Gypsy, the cops, everybody.
You gotta understand!
I had to!
Too much killing!
Too much killing!
Too much killing, I tell you.
Too much killing!
Too much killing!
You can finish this puppet show.
I've never seen him.
As you wish, but you're not going anywhere.
When Emile's here we'll see what you deny,
C'mon boys...
lunch.
And give the photo of The Gypsy to the press.
We gotta move quickly... he's a killer.
Get up.
Hook him up.
Let's hit the chow.
Good-oh!
Send in a man to guard him.
Toss me my coat, I'm cold.
Enjoy your lunch.
Will you bring me a snack?
You can starve, scumbag.
You got a butt, chief?
I'll pay you back.
I'll sign....
Or maybe not.
Don't take your eyes off this smart alec.
Understood, chief.
What do you prefer?
Paté or sausage-loaf?
Whatever you like.
You have my full confidence.
We haven't worked together for a while.
I like night shift.
Not for me.
- I got used to it during the war.
War teaches you nothing.
How?
I made it through the last one.
That's nothing.
- Did you join the force straight away?
No...
I tried other things
I couldn't get a job on the subway.
Me neither.
- I wasn't qualified for the civil service.
Then there was my wife, Paris meant nothing to her.
- She's changed her mind?
You know how it is.
Her uncle had lodgings at the Bastille.
When she came and saw all the cinemas and stuff, she was hooked.
- It's like that, with country girls.
Parents?
No.
I need a "hit and miss".
What?
I need a piss.
Hurry up.
It takes time.
Just a minute.
Go pay the taxidriver, Grenouille.
Just a smidgen more.
Leave it there.
I've gotta catch The Gypsy.
Anyway, if you should see him before me, tell him it wasn't my brother who squealed.
Put everybody wise to that.
You need lolly?
Yeah.
How much?
A 100 thou, OK?
- You need anything else?
A piece.
Ciao, Antoine, and thanks for everything.
Ciao.
Bébert!
Where's Le Blond's brother?
I left him downstairs at his babe's place.
He wanted to see her.
Bolivar Place, 5 or 6.
I'll see if he's in.
Hang on, here he is.
Bébert, Louis on the 'phone.
It's you, Bébert?
Yes.
I must find my brother.
Go up to our place.
Tell him to lock himself in and answer the door to no-one.
No-one, understand.
Tell me, have you seen The Gypsy?
I haven't been able to find him.
The Gypsy's looking for your brother, too.
I gave him Helene's address.
What?
Is Pierre there?
Yes...
Louis?
I'll be back.
Listen, Pépito...
It wasn't him who squealed.
Give us another one.
Don't you interfere!
Don't open.
I told you...
You crazy piece of shit.
Your brother heard nothin'?
Speak up, scum!
He heard nothin' did he, the other night.
Piece of shit!
The slugs are for your brother, but you're goin' anyway.
Go... you scum.
Through there up the stairs.
Come on!
This way.

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that english kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'II we be?
Before that happens we'II be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, Iet's knock off.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1 943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is NichoIson.
I am colonel Saito.
In the name of His imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'II begin.
Let me remind you of general Yamashita's motto:
" Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
battalion, stand at ease.
fall out, Major Hughes.
battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with CIipton.
CIipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an australian.
AII that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
mostly Aussies.
Some Iime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has CIipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
AII right.
You'II stay with the officers.
We'II find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a Iot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps col.
NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
But may I add another word?
please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the Iaw, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'II be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
english prisoners!
Notice I do not say english soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
AII men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, colonel Saito to article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" BeIIigerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read english, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What " Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absoIved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
AII enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
battalion, take up tools.
Move to the Ieft in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
" C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, colonel....
Two.
Stop!
colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'II say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd Iike to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I couId have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I couId have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for NichoIson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
tell him that if his officers will not work I'II be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's CIipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-killed, attempting to escape.
also two others, corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, CIipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
WouIdn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, CIipton, I understand.
truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'II be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'II stop at nothing to get his way.
principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-AII right.
please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
reynolds stole the coconut.
We'II be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
well?
It's like this.
colonel NichoIson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
should a tragedy occur, it wouId be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
battalion, attention.
english prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
AII work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
english corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London PoIytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
-I must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-I have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers beIow--
No officers will do manual labour.
please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
CIipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
please sit down.
Now.
tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
DemoraIization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-I am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
battalion, attention!
battalion, stand at ease.
please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
-I say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'II teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'II put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-There's the challenge.
-I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
tell me what you want and we'II get it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'II do out best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
incorrectly?
unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
AII the work has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
-alter?
-I've increased it.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
colonel, it wouId save time if we could work during dinner.
would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'II try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'II certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, CIipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
AII I need is love.
It's true.
AII you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'II get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you Iike it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
jolly good.
well, I'II be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is in the botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'II be grateful.
-Who?
-Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'II send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
general salute!
general salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I.
-I thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'II be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'II show you the way.
He'II finish his lecture any moment now.
I'II show you the way.
He'II finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Good of you to come.
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
well, come along, then.
col.
Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as geIignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you Iike with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
would you Iike to see where you were?
AII right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
MaIaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'II try to prevent them.
We'II try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'II have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
col.
Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
actually, col.
Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'II say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd Iike that drink now.
I'II apply for a medical discharge.
I'II say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm admiral HaIsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
really?
Good show!
jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
colonel might think I'm maIingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
hello, CIipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no Ionger abused.
honestly, CIipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'II try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, CIipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a Iot to Iearn about the army.
hold him!
hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
AII right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
exactly what did you do?
well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
could you use it in cold blood?
could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'II let you know.
You see what I mean.
well, at Ieast he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
blast!
This is awkward.
silly, it never occurred to me!
well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'II go check right away.
-AII right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'II interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'II be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'II swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'II have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'II take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'II teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'II tell you.
It's wet, miIdewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'II be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
jolly good fun.
jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
well, we'II complete this later.
-CIipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'II make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few maIingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, Iet's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, CIipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-It's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'II try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'II be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I couId have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'II bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'II go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
explosives and L-piIIs go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that colonel NichoIson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
AII right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
still sorry we brought you along?
-feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, weII-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'II cross tomorrow we'II have to do the job manually.
...we'II have to do the job manually.
We'II set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'II set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
AII clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'II start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'II have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
AII right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'II be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I couId.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it wouId turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
still, it's been a good life.
I Iove India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'II be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major CIipton and the sick men and we'II rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'II be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a Iong and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'II watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a Iot to Iearn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
help!
kill him!
kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
kill him!
kill him!
kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till l--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50º/0 chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80º/0.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-It's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
...we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1 943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
" Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What " Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
" C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
-I must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-I have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-I am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
-I say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-There's the challenge.
-I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do out best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-I've increased it.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30º/0 .
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
-Who?
-Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I.
-I thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Good of you to come.
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till l--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50º/0 chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80º/0.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-It's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
...we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
" Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What " Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
" C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut-- l could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-l am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-There's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do out best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-I've increased it.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
-Who?
-Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I.
-l thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Good of you to come.
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing-- l don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
it was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry l'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
ln '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal. lnstant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
...we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head.
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Before that happens, we'll be far away from here, chum.
Let's knock off.
Here lies--
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried.
- Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01 234567... valiant member of the King's own... or the Queen's own or something... who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord 1 943... for the greater glory of--
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the men.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers.
Well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You going to tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
- I'll have a word with this fellow.
- Very good.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'll speak to Clipton.
See you later.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm,Jennings?
- Nearly healed, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good heavens.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
They're all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers, and we'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me, Colonel.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
- What's his name?
I think he understands the situation now.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
He's seems a reasonable type.
I must be pushing on.
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
- Anything we can do.
- Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito, but "reasonable"?
That's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir.
- Yes,Jennings?
About the escape committee, sir.
I've talked with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are a hundred to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, Commander?
I've been biding my time, waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's normally the duty of a captured soldier... to attempt escape... but my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
"Ordered."
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir.
- Interesting point.
- I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point:
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the program.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
If they have that idea to cling to, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave.
Queer bird, even for an American.
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say, " English soldiers."
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
" Better to live like a coolie than die like a hero."
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ as workmen... prisoners of war who are physically fit other than officers--"
- Give me the book.
- By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of precise translation, I'm sure that can be arranged.
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code, of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You'll never get away with calling it a mass escape.
- Most of those men can't walk.
- Shut up!
Is this your soldier's code, murdering unarmed men?
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man:
He's got guts.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
- How's that, sir?
- That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all!
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He didn't actually order us not to escape.
He only suggested--
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're putting him in the oven.
They're putting him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
- One, two, three, pull!
- Hurry!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness... we are far behind the schedule!
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers to direct them.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he pointed out, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
I'll be forced to close the hospital... and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
The doc's going to see the old man.
Sir?
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
They're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed attempting to escape.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'd like to clean you up while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've had a word with Saito.
That man's the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
- Blackmail.
- I know, sir, but he means it.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
- He can't give in.
- It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
And wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are going as slow on it as they dare... but Saito's cut their food rations.
If he makes the sick men work, they're going to die.
- That's all there is to it.
- Yes, I truly understand... but it's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who will stop at nothing to get his way.
" Principle"?
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
- Give in, sir, please.
- I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you a little something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
The colonel won't give in.
It's like this:
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I must protest at the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
"Why does the bridge not progress?"
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
He's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
- Cheers.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
- Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
- Time is short.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
I'm not responsible for the actions of other commanding officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'll have to kill myself.
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
- What's his name?
- Mioura.
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
Then there's demoralization and chaos.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You prove my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
- It's pointless going on like this.
- Stay there!
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
- Do you know the date today?
- I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
- Many thanks.
- I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
- I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
It may be funny, and I'm sure it's done with the best motives... but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- Reeves.
- Yes, sir?
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
- Why not?
- As I was trying to tell you, sir... thejapanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity;
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
It won't be easy, but we have the means at hand.
- The bridge.
- "The bridge," sir?
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
It's going to be difficult in this godforsaken place... where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
You're not so usually slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work for them to do, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
It's essential that they should take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation as engineer.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
- Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
- Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
Look, it's all here.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Then we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster... we build a new bridge at the site selected by Major Reeves... 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it... from a yard and a half of earth moved to two yards.
It's in the general interest, and I was sure you would approve.
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
I've done a time study of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
There's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half, not to overtire them... but wouldn't it be best if we made it the same as the British soldiers?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible... but we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget that we've wasted over a month... through an unfortunate disagreement, for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
I hope theseJapanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years?
- Yes, sir.
That would be something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes.
Down on the beach.
- Thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover, and I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, Commander?
Don't call me Commander.
It's unromantic.
Look, you're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you, and he's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to intrude.
That's okay, Major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
- That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- How did you manage to get that?
- This is a hospital, Major.
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Of course.Jolly good.
I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
- Are you sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
You know, Major, I'm leaving for the States in a few days... and I've already told your intelligence people everything I know.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you come out and see us?
If you want to go over it again, I'll come.
That's very kind of you.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- I see.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
You're terribly sorry, but you're standing me up tonight
You couldn't be more wrong.
- May I see your pass, sir?
- Yes.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the pathway, sir.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
He's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
I'm an American, if that's what you mean.
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
- Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture, sir.
- Thunderous ovation.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
- They certainly have.
- Thank you.
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Fascinating place, isn't it?
Utterly charming.
I didn't realize it was a commando school.
We're discouraging the use of that word.
It has such a melodramatic air.
- What do you do here?
- Sabotage, demolition.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- A pot of tea for one, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
By the way, I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
They were about to shoot him, and he didn't bat an eye.
I suppose if you're about to be shot, there isn't a great deal you can do.
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, thejapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load... so we shall have to go in and smash it up on the ground.
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop and then march.
- With demolition equipment?
- Yes.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage you, but--
- It should be interesting.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
- Are you sure you won't have tea?
- No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I have a luncheon date, and she's beautiful.
- So if there are any questions--
- Yes, of course.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know under the circumstances it's a bit much... but you do have a unique knowledge for our purpose... and we'd love to have you with us.
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous.
- This is embarrassing.
- I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
- With my people?
- Yes, your navy turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
They can't do this to me.
My navy's made a mistake.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
- Very sensible.
- Not that it did me any good.
At Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
I looked at the enlisted men's ward and the officers' ward... and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for awhile."
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is that you can't use me.
You want an American commander named Shears, and he doesn't exist.
When the Navy brass learns the truth about me, they'll say...
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer!"
Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
- " Made."
- I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know?
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
That's a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
When my navy finds out who I am... those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Is this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing.
Naturally, your people couldn't identify you at first.
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
We've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But they can't very well bring you home... and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over to us.
- You see?
- Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned... we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
So you'll have a simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering, sir.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
It's about time you paid a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
"A good idea"?
Let's take another look.
You don't agree the men's morale is high... that discipline has been restored... that their condition has been improved?
- Aren't they a happier lot?
- Yes, sir, but--
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
- That's all true.
- Well then?
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as... collaboration with the enemy... perhaps even as treasonable activity.
Are you all right?
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse work.
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
Don't you realize how important it is to show these people... they can't break us in body or in spirit?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
- British soldiers even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
You're a fine doctor, but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
- I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
- Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr.Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before, in a job like yours, even when it's finished... there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir, and we'll need a good swimmer.
Yes, I'm well aware of your evaluation, Chapman.
I want Shears' opinion.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
Sir, in '39, I came over to London to enlist... and about two years later, I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered?
- Yes, sir.
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
What was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself--
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
I think that's all.
Thank you,Joyce.
- Am I to go with the team, sir?
- We'll let you know.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
He's Canadian.
That's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
If you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
Now then, I've had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
- In that case, maybe--
- Yes, he's right.
We'd better arrange some practice jumps for him immediately.
I'll pop over and check with Freddy right away.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
- Feel like a sniff of air?
- Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that will interest you: the new L pill.
- " L pill"?
- L for lethal; instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
In other words, you're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of the others.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
- He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Why not?
Cambridge don and all that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers, but--
He's not without experience.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind and blew up a couple of bridges... one or two trains and I don't know how many other installations... before theJaps caught him.
- "Caught him"?
- Yes.
Fascinating story.
Sir, it's most annoying.
They say, in view of the time element... they don't think a few practice jumps would be worthwhile.
They say if you make one jump, you've only got 50% chance of injury... two jumps, 80% and three jumps, you're bound to catch a backache.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
"With or without--"
He's in the trees.
Yai says we'll never reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
- Who's leading?
- Yai himself.
He hates thejapanese.
They've taken all his men for railroad work... which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post about three miles away... so we shall have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman, sir?
- Yai's people will bury him... and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language, I don't.
He's leading you back to the river Kwai himself... by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected.
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
Go ahead.
You're lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese, if you like.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
- What's wrong with that thing,Joyce?
- I don't know, sir.
It's taken a beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten... like everything else in this rotten jungle.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay here much longer, we'll be up to our necks.
- I have it all decoded, sir.
- Right.
Read it.
Yes, sir. "One:
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two:
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
Three:
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four:
Good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth having a go for the train, don't you think?
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
We'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I've spoken with Reeves and Hughes, and we won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help and they've agreed, but that won't do it.
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
I explained the situation, and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
- Ask Saito for some of his men.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
Sir, there's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
Let's see.
Don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
- His temperature was 1 04 last night.
- Right, I see.
- And this man?
- Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot.
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.
Most of them are so run-down, their wounds won't heal properly.
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
It's not our policy to keep a man in the hospital... just because he scratched his arm, is it?
- " Not our policy"?
- Is it?
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying, I'm proud of all of you... but we are facing a crisis.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on,Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
There's nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Shut up,Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts now.
- Yeah, but how far and how fast?
- We won't know till I try.
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
Sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route... or whether we could find you if we did.
If you were in my shoes, you know I wouldn't hesitate to leave you here.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
There's a stench of death about you.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
With you, it's just one thing or the other:
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden... because I don't care about your bridge and your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again.
Thank you, Major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working down there on his knees.
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
But since we don't know what time it will cross tomorrow morning... we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles... about three feet under the water, I should think... and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by thejapanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river... but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up... whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
- It looks like your line of country.
- Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble forJoyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing to do...
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion if necessary.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
We'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge... so you'll have to float the stuff down... from upriver... which means building a raft.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
If it wasn't for my ankle, I'd takeJoyce's assignment.
I know.
Do you think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
- I know.
- I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge... and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I don't suppose I've been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times... when suddenly you realize you're nearer the end than the beginning.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy... but I must admit I've had some thoughts along those lines... from time to time.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say... this has been an enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of the bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know... the completion of this link in the railway... will enable us to transport the sick and the disabled... to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me... to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men... and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year... or that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again... you're going to feel very proud... of what you have achieved here... in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You're in business.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do... but I can't think of what it could be... except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now.
If Saito's information is correct... the train should be along in five or ten minutes.
If you don't mind, sir, I'll watch the ceremonies from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir, but I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we'd better have another look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
" Mined"?
" Mined"?
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
There's no time.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
You don't understand, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head.
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Before that happens, we'll be far away from here, chum.
Let's knock off.
Here lies--
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried.
- Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01234567... valiant member of the King's own... or the Queen's own or something... who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord 1943... for the greater glory of--
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the men.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers.
Well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You going to tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
- I'll have a word with this fellow.
- Very good.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'll speak to Clipton.
See you later.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm,Jennings?
- Nearly healed, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good heavens.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
They're all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers, and we'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me, Colonel.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
- What's his name?
I think he understands the situation now.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
He's seems a reasonable type.
I must be pushing on.
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
- Anything we can do.
- Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito, but "reasonable"?
That's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir.
- Yes,Jennings?
About the escape committee, sir.
I've talked with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are a hundred to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, Commander?
I've been biding my time, waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's normally the duty of a captured soldier... to attempt escape... but my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
"Ordered."
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir.
- Interesting point.
- I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point:
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the program.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by the Japanese.
If they have that idea to cling to, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave.
Queer bird, even for an American.
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say, " English soldiers."
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
" Better to live like a coolie than die like a hero."
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ as workmen... prisoners of war who are physically fit other than officers--"
- Give me the book.
- By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of precise translation, I'm sure that can be arranged.
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code, of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You'll never get away with calling it a mass escape.
- Most of those men can't walk.
- Shut up!
Is this your soldier's code, murdering unarmed men?
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man:
He's got guts.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
- How's that, sir?
- That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all!
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He didn't actually order us not to escape.
He only suggested--
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're putting him in the oven.
They're putting him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
- One, two, three, pull!
- Hurry!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness... we are far behind the schedule!
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers to direct them.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he pointed out, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
I'll be forced to close the hospital... and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
The doc's going to see the old man.
Sir?
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
They're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed attempting to escape.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'd like to clean you up while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've had a word with Saito.
That man's the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
- Blackmail.
- I know, sir, but he means it.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
- He can't give in.
- It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
And wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are going as slow on it as they dare... but Saito's cut their food rations.
If he makes the sick men work, they're going to die.
- That's all there is to it.
- Yes, I truly understand... but it's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who will stop at nothing to get his way.
" Principle"?
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
- Give in, sir, please.
- I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you a little something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
The colonel won't give in.
It's like this:
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I must protest at the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
"Why does the bridge not progress?"
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
He's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
- Cheers.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
- Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- Time is short.
I only have 12 weeks.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
I'm not responsible for the actions of other commanding officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'll have to kill myself.
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
- What's his name?
- Mioura.
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
Then there's demoralization and chaos.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You prove my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
- It's pointless going on like this.
- Stay there!
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
- Do you know the date today?
- I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
- Many thanks.
- I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
- I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
It may be funny, and I'm sure it's done with the best motives... but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- Reeves.
- Yes, sir?
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
- Why not?
- As I was trying to tell you, sir... the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity;
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
It won't be easy, but we have the means at hand.
- The bridge.
- "The bridge," sir?
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
It's going to be difficult in this godforsaken place... where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
You're not so usually slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work for them to do, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
It's essential that they should take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation as engineer.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
- Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
- Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
Look, it's all here.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Then we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster... we build a new bridge at the site selected by Major Reeves... 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it... from a yard and a half of earth moved to two yards.
It's in the general interest, and I was sure you would approve.
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
I've done a time study of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
There's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half, not to overtire them... but wouldn't it be best if we made it the same as the British soldiers?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible... but we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget that we've wasted over a month... through an unfortunate disagreement, for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years?
- Yes, sir.
That would be something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes.
Down on the beach.
- Thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover, and I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, Commander?
Don't call me Commander.
It's unromantic.
Look, you're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you, and he's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to intrude.
That's okay, Major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
- That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- How did you manage to get that?
- This is a hospital, Major.
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Of course.
Jolly good.
I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
- Are you sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
You know, Major, I'm leaving for the States in a few days... and I've already told your intelligence people everything I know.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you come out and see us?
If you want to go over it again, I'll come.
That's very kind of you.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- I see.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 10:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
You're terribly sorry, but you're standing me up tonight
You couldn't be more wrong.
- May I see your pass, sir?
- Yes.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the pathway, sir.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy, Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see?
He's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
I'm an American, if that's what you mean.
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
- Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture, sir.
- Thunderous ovation.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
- They certainly have.
- Thank you.
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Fascinating place, isn't it?
Utterly charming.
I didn't realize it was a commando school.
We're discouraging the use of that word.
It has such a melodramatic air.
- What do you do here?
- Sabotage, demolition.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- A pot of tea for one, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
They were about to shoot him, and he didn't bat an eye.
I suppose if you're about to be shot, there isn't a great deal you can do.
Here is the River Kwai...
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, the Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load... so we shall have to go in and smash it up on the ground.
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop and then march.
- With demolition equipment?
- Yes.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage you, but--
- It should be interesting.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
- Are you sure you won't have tea?
- No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I have a luncheon date, and she's beautiful.
- So if there are any questions--
- Yes, of course.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know under the circumstances it's a bit much... but you do have a unique knowledge for our purpose... and we'd love to have you with us.
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous.
- This is embarrassing.
- I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
- With my people?
- Yes, your navy turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
They can't do this to me.
My navy's made a mistake.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
- Very sensible.
- Not that it did me any good.
At Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
I looked at the enlisted men's ward and the officers' ward... and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for awhile."
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is that you can't use me.
You want an American commander named Shears, and he doesn't exist.
When the Navy brass learns the truth about me, they'll say...
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer!"
Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
- " Made."
- I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know?
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
That's a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
When my navy finds out who I am... those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Is this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing.
Naturally, your people couldn't identify you at first.
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
We've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But they can't very well bring you home... and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over to us.
- You see?
- Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned... we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
So you'll have a simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering, sir.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
It's about time you paid a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
"A good idea"?
Let's take another look.
You don't agree the men's morale is high... that discipline has been restored... that their condition has been improved?
- Aren't they a happier lot?
- Yes, sir, but--
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
- That's all true.
- Well then?
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as... collaboration with the enemy... perhaps even as treasonable activity.
Are you all right?
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse work.
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
Don't you realize how important it is to show these people... they can't break us in body or in spirit?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
- British soldiers even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
You're a fine doctor, but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
- I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
- Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before, in a job like yours, even when it's finished... there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir, and we'll need a good swimmer.
Yes, I'm well aware of your evaluation, Chapman.
I want Shears' opinion.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
Sir, in '39, I came over to London to enlist... and about two years later, I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered?
- Yes, sir.
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
What was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself--
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
- Am I to go with the team, sir?
- We'll let you know.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
He's Canadian.
That's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
If you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
Now then, I've had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
- In that case, maybe--
- Yes, he's right.
We'd better arrange some practice jumps for him immediately.
I'll pop over and check with Freddy right away.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
- Feel like a sniff of air?
- Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that will interest you: the new L pill.
- " L pill"?
- L for lethal; instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
In other words, you're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of the others.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
- He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Why not?
Cambridge don and all that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers, but--
He's not without experience.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind and blew up a couple of bridges... one or two trains and I don't know how many other installations... before the Japs caught him.
- "Caught him"?
- Yes.
Fascinating story.
Sir, it's most annoying.
They say, in view of the time element... they don't think a few practice jumps would be worthwhile.
They say if you make one jump, you've only got 50% chance of injury... two jumps, 80% and three jumps, you're bound to catch a backache.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
"With or without--"
He's in the trees.
Yai says we'll never reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
- Who's leading?
- Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They've taken all his men for railroad work... which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post about three miles away... so we shall have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman, sir?
- Yai's people will bury him... and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language, I don't.
He's leading you back to the river Kwai himself... by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected.
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
Go ahead.
You're lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese, if you like.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
- What's wrong with that thing, Joyce?
- I don't know, sir.
It's taken a beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten... like everything else in this rotten jungle.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay here much longer, we'll be up to our necks.
- I have it all decoded, sir.
- Right.
Read it.
Yes, sir. "One:
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two:
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
Three:
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four:
Good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth having a go for the train, don't you think?
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
We'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I've spoken with Reeves and Hughes, and we won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help and they've agreed, but that won't do it.
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
I explained the situation, and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
- Ask Saito for some of his men.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
Sir, there's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
Let's see.
Don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
- His temperature was 1 04 last night.
- Right, I see.
- And this man?
- Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot.
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.
Most of them are so run-down, their wounds won't heal properly.
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
It's not our policy to keep a man in the hospital... just because he scratched his arm, is it?
- " Not our policy"?
- Is it?
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying, I'm proud of all of you... but we are facing a crisis.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
There's nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts now.
- Yeah, but how far and how fast?
- We won't know till I try.
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
Sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route... or whether we could find you if we did.
If you were in my shoes, you know I wouldn't hesitate to leave you here.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
There's a stench of death about you.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
With you, it's just one thing or the other:
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden... because I don't care about your bridge and your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again.
Thank you, Major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working down there on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
But since we don't know what time it will cross tomorrow morning... we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles... about three feet under the water, I should think... and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river... but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up... whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
- It looks like your line of country.
- Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing to do...
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion if necessary.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
We'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge... so you'll have to float the stuff down... from upriver... which means building a raft.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
If it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
Do you think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
- I know.
- I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge... and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I don't suppose I've been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times... when suddenly you realize you're nearer the end than the beginning.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy... but I must admit I've had some thoughts along those lines... from time to time.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say... this has been an enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of the bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know... the completion of this link in the railway... will enable us to transport the sick and the disabled... to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me... to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men... and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year... or that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again... you're going to feel very proud... of what you have achieved here... in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You're in business.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do... but I can't think of what it could be... except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now.
If Saito's information is correct... the train should be along in five or ten minutes.
If you don't mind, sir, I'll watch the ceremonies from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir, but I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we'd better have another look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
" Mined"?
" Mined"?
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
There's no time.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
You don't understand, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You gonna tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I...
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
- Clipton!
- Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
- Time!
- Here.
- Here is where we must win through.
- Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
- Major Clipton did mention that.
- Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now...
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant...
What's his name?
- Miura.
- Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
- ...over Russia in 1905.
- Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Sir, 12, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now...
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we...
- Carry on, Hughes.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Oh, yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, sir, please?
- Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I, sir.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come.
- I hope they took care of you.
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
- So if there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your CINC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived here at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
- Made.
I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your CINC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned we're fairly informal about those things in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
- Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
- Yes, sir, but...
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
- That's all true.
- Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new L pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Caught him?
- Yes.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
- No?
- If you make one jump you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Who's gonna lead the way?
- Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...
- ...just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Now, look here, men.
It goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
- You're gonna leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet under the water, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
- ...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
- Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 10 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favor I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What "Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labor.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- I've increased it.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
- Who?
- Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Good of you to come.
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
- If there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new "L" pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80%.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking...
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
!
- Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head.
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Before that happens, we'll be far away from here, chum.
Let's knock off.
Here lies--
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried.
- Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01 234567... valiant member of the King's own... or the Queen's own or something... who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord 1 943... for the greater glory of--
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the men.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers.
Well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You going to tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
- I'll have a word with this fellow.
- Very good.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'll speak to Clipton.
See you later.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm,Jennings?
- Nearly healed, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good heavens.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
They're all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers, and we'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me, Colonel.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
- What's his name?
I think he understands the situation now.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
He's seems a reasonable type.
I must be pushing on.
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
- Anything we can do.
- Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito, but "reasonable"?
That's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir.
- Yes,Jennings?
About the escape committee, sir.
I've talked with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are a hundred to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, Commander?
I've been biding my time, waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's normally the duty of a captured soldier... to attempt escape... but my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
"Ordered."
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir.
- Interesting point.
- I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point:
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the program.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
If they have that idea to cling to, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave.
Queer bird, even for an American.
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say, " English soldiers."
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
" Better to live like a coolie than die like a hero."
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ as workmen... prisoners of war who are physically fit other than officers--"
- Give me the book.
- By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of precise translation, I'm sure that can be arranged.
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code, of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You'll never get away with calling it a mass escape.
- Most of those men can't walk.
- Shut up!
Is this your soldier's code, murdering unarmed men?
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man:
He's got guts.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
- How's that, sir?
- That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all!
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He didn't actually order us not to escape.
He only suggested--
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're putting him in the oven.
They're putting him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
- One, two, three, pull!
- Hurry!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness... we are far behind the schedule!
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers to direct them.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he pointed out, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
I'll be forced to close the hospital... and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
The doc's going to see the old man.
Sir?
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
They're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed attempting to escape.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'd like to clean you up while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've had a word with Saito.
That man's the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
- Blackmail.
- I know, sir, but he means it.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
- He can't give in.
- It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
And wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are going as slow on it as they dare... but Saito's cut their food rations.
If he makes the sick men work, they're going to die.
- That's all there is to it.
- Yes, I truly understand... but it's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who will stop at nothing to get his way.
" Principle"?
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
- Give in, sir, please.
- I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you a little something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
The colonel won't give in.
It's like this:
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I must protest at the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
"Why does the bridge not progress?"
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
He's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
- Cheers.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
- Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
- Time is short.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
I'm not responsible for the actions of other commanding officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'll have to kill myself.
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
- What's his name?
- Mioura.
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
Then there's demoralization and chaos.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You prove my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
- It's pointless going on like this.
- Stay there!
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
- Do you know the date today?
- I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
- Many thanks.
- I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
- I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
It may be funny, and I'm sure it's done with the best motives... but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- Reeves.
- Yes, sir?
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
- Why not?
- As I was trying to tell you, sir... thejapanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity;
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
It won't be easy, but we have the means at hand.
- The bridge.
- "The bridge," sir?
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
It's going to be difficult in this godforsaken place... where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
You're not so usually slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work for them to do, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
It's essential that they should take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation as engineer.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
- Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
- Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
Look, it's all here.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Then we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster... we build a new bridge at the site selected by Major Reeves... 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it... from a yard and a half of earth moved to two yards.
It's in the general interest, and I was sure you would approve.
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
I've done a time study of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
There's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half, not to overtire them... but wouldn't it be best if we made it the same as the British soldiers?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible... but we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget that we've wasted over a month... through an unfortunate disagreement, for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
I hope theseJapanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years?
- Yes, sir.
That would be something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes.
Down on the beach.
- Thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover, and I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, Commander?
Don't call me Commander.
It's unromantic.
Look, you're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you, and he's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to intrude.
That's okay, Major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
- That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- How did you manage to get that?
- This is a hospital, Major.
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Of course.Jolly good.
I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
- Are you sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
You know, Major, I'm leaving for the States in a few days... and I've already told your intelligence people everything I know.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you come out and see us?
If you want to go over it again, I'll come.
That's very kind of you.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- I see.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
You're terribly sorry, but you're standing me up tonight
You couldn't be more wrong.
- May I see your pass, sir?
- Yes.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the pathway, sir.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
He's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
I'm an American, if that's what you mean.
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
- Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture, sir.
- Thunderous ovation.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
- They certainly have.
- Thank you.
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Fascinating place, isn't it?
Utterly charming.
I didn't realize it was a commando school.
We're discouraging the use of that word.
It has such a melodramatic air.
- What do you do here?
- Sabotage, demolition.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- A pot of tea for one, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
By the way, I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
They were about to shoot him, and he didn't bat an eye.
I suppose if you're about to be shot, there isn't a great deal you can do.
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, thejapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load... so we shall have to go in and smash it up on the ground.
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop and then march.
- With demolition equipment?
- Yes.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage you, but--
- It should be interesting.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
- Are you sure you won't have tea?
- No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I have a luncheon date, and she's beautiful.
- So if there are any questions--
- Yes, of course.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know under the circumstances it's a bit much... but you do have a unique knowledge for our purpose... and we'd love to have you with us.
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous.
- This is embarrassing.
- I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
- With my people?
- Yes, your navy turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
They can't do this to me.
My navy's made a mistake.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
- Very sensible.
- Not that it did me any good.
At Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
I looked at the enlisted men's ward and the officers' ward... and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for awhile."
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is that you can't use me.
You want an American commander named Shears, and he doesn't exist.
When the Navy brass learns the truth about me, they'll say...
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer!"
Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
- " Made."
- I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know?
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
That's a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
When my navy finds out who I am... those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Is this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing.
Naturally, your people couldn't identify you at first.
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
We've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But they can't very well bring you home... and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over to us.
- You see?
- Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned... we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
So you'll have a simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering, sir.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
It's about time you paid a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
"A good idea"?
Let's take another look.
You don't agree the men's morale is high... that discipline has been restored... that their condition has been improved?
- Aren't they a happier lot?
- Yes, sir, but--
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
- That's all true.
- Well then?
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as... collaboration with the enemy... perhaps even as treasonable activity.
Are you all right?
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse work.
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
Don't you realize how important it is to show these people... they can't break us in body or in spirit?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
- British soldiers even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
You're a fine doctor, but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
- I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
- Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr.Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before, in a job like yours, even when it's finished... there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir, and we'll need a good swimmer.
Yes, I'm well aware of your evaluation, Chapman.
I want Shears' opinion.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
Sir, in '39, I came over to London to enlist... and about two years later, I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered?
- Yes, sir.
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
What was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself--
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
I think that's all.
Thank you,Joyce.
- Am I to go with the team, sir?
- We'll let you know.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
He's Canadian.
That's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
If you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
Now then, I've had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
- In that case, maybe--
- Yes, he's right.
We'd better arrange some practice jumps for him immediately.
I'll pop over and check with Freddy right away.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
- Feel like a sniff of air?
- Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that will interest you: the new L pill.
- " L pill"?
- L for lethal; instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
In other words, you're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of the others.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
- He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Why not?
Cambridge don and all that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers, but--
He's not without experience.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind and blew up a couple of bridges... one or two trains and I don't know how many other installations... before theJaps caught him.
- "Caught him"?
- Yes.
Fascinating story.
Sir, it's most annoying.
They say, in view of the time element... they don't think a few practice jumps would be worthwhile.
They say if you make one jump, you've only got 50% chance of injury... two jumps, 80% and three jumps, you're bound to catch a backache.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
"With or without--"
He's in the trees.
Yai says we'll never reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
- Who's leading?
- Yai himself.
He hates thejapanese.
They've taken all his men for railroad work... which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post about three miles away... so we shall have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman, sir?
- Yai's people will bury him... and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language, I don't.
He's leading you back to the river Kwai himself... by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected.
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
Go ahead.
You're lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese, if you like.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
- What's wrong with that thing,Joyce?
- I don't know, sir.
It's taken a beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten... like everything else in this rotten jungle.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay here much longer, we'll be up to our necks.
- I have it all decoded, sir.
- Right.
Read it.
Yes, sir. "One:
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two:
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
Three:
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four:
Good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth having a go for the train, don't you think?
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
We'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I've spoken with Reeves and Hughes, and we won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help and they've agreed, but that won't do it.
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
I explained the situation, and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
- Ask Saito for some of his men.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
Sir, there's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
Let's see.
Don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
- His temperature was 1 04 last night.
- Right, I see.
- And this man?
- Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot.
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.
Most of them are so run-down, their wounds won't heal properly.
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
It's not our policy to keep a man in the hospital... just because he scratched his arm, is it?
- " Not our policy"?
- Is it?
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying, I'm proud of all of you... but we are facing a crisis.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on,Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
There's nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Shut up,Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts now.
- Yeah, but how far and how fast?
- We won't know till I try.
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
Sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route... or whether we could find you if we did.
If you were in my shoes, you know I wouldn't hesitate to leave you here.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
There's a stench of death about you.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
With you, it's just one thing or the other:
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden... because I don't care about your bridge and your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again.
Thank you, Major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working down there on his knees.
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
But since we don't know what time it will cross tomorrow morning... we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles... about three feet under the water, I should think... and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by thejapanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river... but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up... whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
- It looks like your line of country.
- Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble forJoyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing to do...
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion if necessary.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
We'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge... so you'll have to float the stuff down... from upriver... which means building a raft.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
If it wasn't for my ankle, I'd takeJoyce's assignment.
I know.
Do you think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
- I know.
- I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge... and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I don't suppose I've been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times... when suddenly you realize you're nearer the end than the beginning.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy... but I must admit I've had some thoughts along those lines... from time to time.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say... this has been an enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of the bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know... the completion of this link in the railway... will enable us to transport the sick and the disabled... to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me... to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men... and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year... or that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again... you're going to feel very proud... of what you have achieved here... in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You're in business.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do... but I can't think of what it could be... except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now.
If Saito's information is correct... the train should be along in five or ten minutes.
If you don't mind, sir, I'll watch the ceremonies from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir, but I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we'd better have another look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
" Mined"?
" Mined"?
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
There's no time.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
You don't understand, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head.
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Before that happens, we'll be far away from here, chum.
Let's knock off.
Here lies--
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried.
- Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01 234567... valiant member of the King's own... or the Queen's own or something... who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord 1 943... for the greater glory of--
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the men.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers.
Well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You going to tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, You will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard...
You will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
- I'll have a word with this fellow.
- Very good.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'll speak to Clipton.
See you later.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm,Jennings?
- Nearly healed, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good heavens.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
They're all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, You can finish that shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers, and we'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me, Colonel.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
- What's his name?
I think he understands the situation now.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
He's seems a reasonable type.
I must be pushing on.
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
- Anything we can do.
- Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito, but "reasonable"?
That's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir.
- Yes,Jennings?
About the escape committee, sir.
I've talked with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are a hundred to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, Commander?
I've been biding my time, waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's normally the duty of a captured soldier... to attempt escape... but my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
"Ordered."
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir.
- Interesting point.
- I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point:
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the program.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
If they have that idea to cling to, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave.
Queer bird, even for an American.
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say, " English soldiers."
From the moment you surrendered...
You ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
" Better to live like a coolie than die like a hero."
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ as workmen... prisoners of war who are physically fit other than officers--"
- Give me the book.
- By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of precise translation, I'm sure that can be arranged.
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code, of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order Your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count...
You and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You'll never get away with calling it a mass escape.
- Most of those men can't walk.
- Shut up!
Is this your soldier's code, murdering unarmed men?
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man:
He's got guts.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
- How's that, sir?
- That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all!
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He didn't actually order us not to escape.
He only suggested--
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're putting him in the oven.
They're putting him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
- One, two, three, pull!
- Hurry!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness... we are far behind the schedule!
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers to direct them.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he pointed out, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
I'll be forced to close the hospital... and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
The doc's going to see the old man.
Sir?
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
They're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed attempting to escape.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'd like to clean you up while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've had a word with Saito.
That man's the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
- Blackmail.
- I know, sir, but he means it.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
- He can't give in.
- It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
And wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are going as slow on it as they dare... but Saito's cut their food rations.
If he makes the sick men work, they're going to die.
- That's all there is to it.
- Yes, I truly understand... but it's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who will stop at nothing to get his way.
" Principle"?
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
- Give in, sir, please.
- I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you a little something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
The colonel won't give in.
It's like this:
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I must protest at the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
"Why does the bridge not progress?"
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, You are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
He's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
- Cheers.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
- Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think You quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
- Time is short.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
I'm not responsible for the actions of other commanding officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'll have to kill myself.
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
- What's his name?
- Mioura.
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
Then there's demoralization and chaos.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You prove my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
- It's pointless going on like this.
- Stay there!
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
- Do you know the date today?
- I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
- Many thanks.
- I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
- I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
It may be funny, and I'm sure it's done with the best motives... but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- Reeves.
- Yes, sir?
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
- Why not?
- As I was trying to tell you, sir... thejapanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity;
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
It won't be easy, but we have the means at hand.
- The bridge.
- "The bridge," sir?
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
It's going to be difficult in this godforsaken place... where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
You're not so usually slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work for them to do, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
It's essential that they should take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation as engineer.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
- Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
- Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
Look, it's all here.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Then we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster... we build a new bridge at the site selected by Major Reeves... 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it... from a yard and a half of earth moved to two yards.
It's in the general interest, and I was sure you would approve.
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
I've done a time study of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
There's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half, not to overtire them... but wouldn't it be best if we made it the same as the British soldiers?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible... but we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget that we've wasted over a month... through an unfortunate disagreement, for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
I hope theseJapanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years?
- Yes, sir.
That would be something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes.
Down on the beach.
- Thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure You'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover, and I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, Commander?
Don't call me Commander.
It's unromantic.
Look, you're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you, and he's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to intrude.
That's okay, Major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
- That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- How did you manage to get that?
- This is a hospital, Major.
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Of course.Jolly good.
I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
- Are you sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
You know, Major, I'm leaving for the States in a few days... and I've already told your intelligence people everything I know.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you come out and see us?
If you want to go over it again, I'll come.
That's very kind of you.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- I see.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
You're terribly sorry, but you're standing me up tonight
You couldn't be more wrong.
- May I see your pass, sir?
- Yes.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the pathway, sir.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
He's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
I'm an American, if that's what you mean.
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
- Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture, sir.
- Thunderous ovation.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
- They certainly have.
- Thank you.
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Fascinating place, isn't it?
Utterly charming.
I didn't realize it was a commando school.
We're discouraging the use of that word.
It has such a melodramatic air.
- What do you do here?
- Sabotage, demolition.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What "Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasión I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- I've increased it.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decisión that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
- Who?
- Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Good of you to come.
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
- If there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new "L" pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80%.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokio signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversión.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking...
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
!
- Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1 943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
-You gonna tell him the truth?
-Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
-l'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
-Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
-Good.
-How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-l think he understands now.
-ls that so?
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
-Right.
-But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
-lnteresting?
-Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-l'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-l see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
-Clipton!
-Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
-Time!
-Here.
-Here is where we must win through.
-Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it. I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
-Major Clipton did mention that.
-Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
- What's his name?
-Miura.
-Miura.
--is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-l am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
-...over Russia in 1 905.
-Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Sir, 1 2, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes. I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-But there's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, gentlemen?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do our best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
-Carry on, Hughes.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
-We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
-Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning. I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Oh, yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
-l'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me.
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
-Mind if I have one?
-No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have a martini?
-No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
-Lord who?
-Mountbatten.
-We're one of his special pigeons.
-Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, sir, please?
-Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I, sir.
-l thought you were the enemy.
-l'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can l do for you, sir?
-l was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Very good of you to come.
-l hope they took care of you.
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape. lt was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How will you get there?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-l don't want to discourage-- -lt should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
-So if there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this to me.
-l'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived here at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
-Made.
I'd like that drink now.
-Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
-Where did you get this?
-lt took a bit of doing because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-l wonder what he's thinking.
-l haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
-Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
-Yes, sir, but--
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
-That's all true.
-Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry l'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-l was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new L pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal. instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-lt's Warden I don't get.
-Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Caught him?
-Yes.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
-No?
-lf you make one jump you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Who's gonna lead the way?
-Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers.
-They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-l've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
-And that man there?
-His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
-l'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Now, look here, men. lt goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it. I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
-lt's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
-You're gonna leave me here.
-lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet under the water, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
-...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
-Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 1 0 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What "Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasión I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- I've increased it.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decisión that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
- Who?
- Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Good of you to come.
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
- Lf there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new "L" pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80%.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokio signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
- You're going to leave me here.
- Lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversión.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking...
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
!
- Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Subtitles by GelulalSDI
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What "Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasión I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- I've increased it.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decisión that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
- Who?
- Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Good of you to come.
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
- Lf there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new "L" pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80%.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokio signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
- You're going to leave me here.
- Lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversión.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking...
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
!
- Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Subtitles by GelulalSDI
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favor I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What "Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labor.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- I've increased it.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
- Who?
- Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Good of you to come.
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
- If there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new "L" pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80%.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking...
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
!
- Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
" Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What " Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
" C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut-- l could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-l am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-There's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do out best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-I've increased it.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
-Who?
-Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I.
-l thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Good of you to come.
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing-- l don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
it was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry l'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
ln '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal. lnstant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
...we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1 943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
-You gonna tell him the truth?
-Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
-l'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
-Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
-Good.
-How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-l think he understands now.
-ls that so?
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
-Right.
-But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
-lnteresting?
-Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-l'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-l see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
-Clipton!
-Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
-Time!
-Here.
-Here is where we must win through.
-Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it. I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
-Major Clipton did mention that.
-Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
- What's his name?
-Miura.
-Miura.
--is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-l am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
-...over Russia in 1 905.
-Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Sir, 1 2, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes. I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-But there's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, gentlemen?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do our best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
-Carry on, Hughes.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
-We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
-Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning. I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Oh, yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
-l'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me.
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
-Mind if I have one?
-No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have a martini?
-No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
-Lord who?
-Mountbatten.
-We're one of his special pigeons.
-Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, sir, please?
-Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I, sir.
-l thought you were the enemy.
-l'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can l do for you, sir?
-l was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Very good of you to come.
-l hope they took care of you.
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape. lt was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How will you get there?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-l don't want to discourage-- -lt should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
-So if there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this to me.
-l'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived here at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
-Made.
I'd like that drink now.
-Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
-Where did you get this?
-lt took a bit of doing because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-l wonder what he's thinking.
-l haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
-Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
-Yes, sir, but--
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
-That's all true.
-Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry l'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-l was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new L pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal. instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-lt's Warden I don't get.
-Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Caught him?
-Yes.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
-No?
-lf you make one jump you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Who's gonna lead the way?
-Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers.
-They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-l've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
-And that man there?
-His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
-l'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Now, look here, men. lt goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it. I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
-lt's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
-You're gonna leave me here.
-lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet under the water, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
-...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
-Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 1 0 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.

I GIVE YOU BUTT THIS MORNING, BOTH OF YOU.
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
I WANT TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO KEEP THIS LIGHTER.

WHICH WILL SOON CONNECT BANGKOK WITH RANGOON.
YOU BRITISH PRISONERS HAVE BEEN CHOSEN...

I HEARD YOUR REMARKS JUST NOW, SIR.
I CAN ASSURE YOU MY MEN WILL CARRY ON IN THE WAY ONE EXPECTS OF THE BRITISH SOLDIER.
AND NATURALLY, MY OFFICERS AND I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CONDUCT.
SIR, YOU MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT THE USE OF OFFICERS FOR MANUAL LABOR...
IS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN BY THE GENEVA CONVENTION.
IS THAT SO ?
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A COPY OF THE CONVENTION WITH ME...
AND WOULD BE GLAD TO LET YOU GLANCE THROUGH IT, IF YOU WISH.

AH, CLIPTON.
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.
HOW'S THE ARM, JENNINGS ?
NEARLY HEALED, SIR.
OH, SIR, THIS IS COMMANDER SHEARS OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
GOOD HEAVENS !
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR ?
WE FOUND HIM AND AN AUSTRALIAN.
THEY'RE ALL THAT'S LEFT OF THE PRISONERS WHO BUILT THE CAMP.
THE U.S. NAVY, OUT HERE ?
FOR A DEEPWATER SAILOR, I AM SORT OF LANDLOCKED.
YOU LOST YOUR SHIP ?
THE HOUSTON.
I MADE IT ASHORE, BUT I GOT SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER SURVIVORS.
AND YOUR GROUP HERE ?
MOSTLY AUSSIES, SOME LIME--
SOME BRITISH, INDIANS, BURMESE, SIAMESE.
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM ?
THEY DIED...
OF MALARIA, DYSENTERY, BERIBERI, GANGRENE.
OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH:
FAMINE, OVERWORK,
BULLET WOUNDS, SNAKE BITES, SAITO.
AND THERE WERE SOME WHO JUST GOT TIRED OF LIVING.
HAS CLIPTON HAD A LOOK AT YOU ?
JUST ABOUT TO, SIR.
COME OVER HERE, COMMANDER.
YOU CAN SHAVE LATER.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL STAY WITH THE OFFICERS, OF COURSE,
AND WE'LL SCRAPE UP SOME DECENT CLOTHING.
DON'T BOTHER ABOUT ME, COLONEL.
I'M NOT ANXIOUS TO GET OFF THE SICK LIST.
BESIDES, THIS IS WORKING KIT.
IT'S THE FASHION OUT HERE.
THE OFFICERS IN YOUR PARTY DID MANUAL LABOR ?
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.
ACTUALLY, I RAISED THAT VERY POINT WITH COLONEL-- WHAT'S HIS NAME ?
SAITO.
I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION NOW.
IS THAT SO ?
I MUST SAY HE SEEMS QUITE A REASONABLE TYPE.
WELL, I MUST BE PUSHING ON.
CLIPTON, THERE'S AN OFFICERS' MEETING AT 7:00.
GIVE ME YOUR REQUIREMENTS.
YES, SIR.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO.
OH, THANK YOU, SIR.
[ Laughing ]
WHAT IS IT ?
NEVER MIND.
GO ON, SAY IT.
I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF THINGS TO CALL SAITO,
BUT "REASONABLE," THAT'S A NEW ONE.
PERHAPS COLONEL NICHOLSON DEFINES THE WORD DIFFERENTLY.
[ Japanese ]
ANY OTHER POINTS ?
BY YOUR LEAVE, SIR.
YES, JENNINGS ?
ABOUT THE ESCAPE COMMITTEE, SIR.
I'VE HAD A TALK WITH COMMANDER SHEARS--
THERE WON'T BE ANY ESCAPE COMMITTEE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR.
LT.
JENNINGS HAS A PLAN.
YES, I'M SURE JENNINGS HAS A PLAN, BUT ESCAPE ?
WHERE ?
INTO THIS JUNGLE ?
THAT FELLOW SAITO IS RIGHT.
NO NEED FOR BARBED WIRE HERE.
ONE CHANCE IN A HUNDRED OF SURVIVAL.
I'M SURE A MAN OF COMMANDER SHEAR'S EXPERIENCE WILL BACK ME UP ON THAT POINT.
OH, I'D SAY THE ODDS AGAINST A SUCCESSFUL ESCAPE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED TO ONE.
RIGHT.
BUT MAY I ADD ANOTHER WORD, COLONEL.
PLEASE.
THE ODDS AGAINST SURVIVAL IN THIS CAMP ARE EVEN WORSE.
YOU'VE SEEN THE GRAVEYARD.
THEY'RE YOUR REAL ODDS.
TO GIVE UP HOPE OF ESCAPE, TO EVEN STOP THINKING ABOUT IT...
IS LIKE ACCEPTING A DEATH SENTENCE.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TRIED TO ESCAPE, COMMANDER ?
OH, I'VE BEEN BIDING MY TIME, WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT, THE RIGHT COMPANY.
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
OF COURSE, IT'S NORMALLY THE DUTY OF A CAPTURED SOLDIER TO ATTEMPT ESCAPE.
BUT MY MEN AND I ARE INVOLVED IN A CURIOUS LEGAL POINT OF WHICH YOU ARE UNAWARE.
IN SINGAPORE, WE WERE ORDERED TO SURRENDER BY COMMAND HEADQUARTERS.
ORDERED, MIND YOU.
THEREFORE, IN OUR CASE,
ESCAPE MIGHT WELL BE AN INFRACTION OF MILITARY LAW.
INTERESTING ?
YES, INTERESTING POINT.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW YOU.
YOU MEAN, YOU INTEND TO UPHOLD THE LETTER OF THE LAW, NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ?
WITHOUT LAW, COMMANDER, THERE IS NO CIVILIZATION.
THAT'S JUST MY POINT.
HERE, THERE IS NO CIVILIZATION.
THEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE IT.
I SUGGEST WE DROP THE SUBJECT OF ESCAPE.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ?
WELL, I THINK WE'RE ALL CLEAR ON THE PROGRAM.
I WANT EVERYTHING TO GO OFF WITHOUT A HITCH STARTING TOMORROW MORNING.
AND REMEMBER THIS:
OUR MEN MUST ALWAYS FEEL THEY ARE STILL COMMANDED BY US AND NOT BY THE JAPANESE.
SO LONG AS THEY HAVE THAT IDEA TO CLING TO, THEY'LL BE SOLDIERS AND NOT SLAVES.
ARE YOU WITH ME THERE, COMMANDER ?
WELL, I, UH-- I HOPE THEY CAN REMAIN SOLDIERS, COLONEL.
AS FOR ME, I'M JUST A SLAVE, A LIVING SLAVE.
QUEER BIRD, EVEN FOR AN AMERICAN.
HE'S BEEN IN ISOLATION TOO LONG, POOR CHAP.
CUT OFF FROM HIS UNIT.
THAT SHOULD BE A LESSON TO ALL OF US.

REALLY IT IS.
WHAT ABOUT HIM ?
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY ORDER US NOT TO ESCAPE.
HE ONLY SUGGESTED--
LISTEN, KIDDO.
WHEN A MAN LIKE YOUR COLONEL SUGGESTS SOMETHING, IT'S AN ORDER.
[ Man Speaking Japanese ] HERE WE GO AGAIN.
[ Indistinct ]
COL.
SAITO SAYS ALL OFFICERS TO PUNISHMENT HUT.
TELL THEM TO GO.
NOT YOU.
[ Japanese ]
COME.
[ Japanese ]
[ Men Shouting ] LEAVE HIM ALONE !
[ Shouting Continues ]
[ Shouting Stops ]
THEY'RE GONNA PUT HIM IN THE OVEN.

YOU WISH TO SEE ME ?
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEE YOU FOR THREE DAYS.
IT'S ABOUT COL.
NICHOLSON.
HE'S BEEN SHUT UP IN THAT HUT--
I COULD HAVE YOU SHOT.
THOSE PRISONERS WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE-- THEY WERE IN YOUR CHARGE.
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ESCAPE.
IT DOES NOT MATTER.
ONE MUST EVEN RESPECT THOSE WHO TRIED.
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT BETWEEN ESCAPE AND DEATH...
THEY WERE SOLDIERS AGAIN.
BUT IT IS INSANE TO TRY AND ESCAPE.
TWO SOLDIERS SHOT, THE THIRD DROWNED !
TO WHAT END ?
IT WAS AN ESCAPE FROM REALITY.
HERE IS REALITY.
THIS SHOWS THE POSITION WORK SHOULD HAVE REACHED BY NOON TODAY,
AND THIS SHOWS THE POSITION OF ACTUAL PROGRESS.
BECAUSE OF YOUR COLONEL'S STUBBORNNESS,
WE ARE FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE !
THAT IS NOT ALL.
ENLISTED PRISONERS SABOTAGE THE WORK.
YES, I HAVE SEEN IT.
I COULD HAVE THEM ALL SHOT.
THEN WHO WOULD BUILD YOUR BRIDGE ?
BESIDES, ARE YOU SURE IT'S SABOTAGE ?
PERHAPS THE MEN DON'T WORK WELL WITHOUT THEIR OWN OFFICERS TO DIRECT THEM.
MY OFFICERS WILL DIRECT THEM.
YOUR OFFICERS WILL WORK BESIDE THEM.
THAT'S FOR COL.
NICHOLSON TO DECIDE.
AS HE POINTED OUT, IT'S AGAINST THE RULES--
DO NOT SPEAK TO ME OF RULES.
THIS IS WAR !
THIS IS NOT A GAME OF CRICKET.
HE'S MAD, YOUR COLONEL.
QUITE MAD.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
I HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW YOU ONE VISIT TO YOUR COLONEL.
THANK YOU.
TELL HIM THAT IF HIS OFFICERS WILL NOT WORK,
I'LL BE FORCED TO CLOSE THE HOSPITAL...
AND YOUR PATIENTS WILL WORK IN THEIR PLACE.
MANY WILL DIE, AND HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE.
GO AND SPEAK TO HIM.
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES.
HEY, THE DOC'S GOING TO SEE THE OLD MAN.
SIR ?
IT'S CLIPTON, SIR.
I BROUGHT YOU A FEW THINGS.
[ Gasping ] HOW ARE THE MEN ?
FINE, SIR.
FINE.
WE SCRAPED TOGETHER A LITTLE MEAT AND A COCONUT.
A-AND THE OFFICERS ?
OH, THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD.
THEY'RE STILL IN DETENTION.
AND LT.
JENNINGS-- JENNINGS IS DEAD.
WHAT ?
KILLED ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE.
ALSO TWO OTHERS WITH HIM.
CORPORAL WEAVER AND THE AMERICAN.
[ Sighs ]
JENNINGS-- POOR, BRAVE LAD.
I WARNED HIM, DIDN'T I, CLIPTON ?
LOOK, SIR, WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME.
I'M GOING TO CLEAN YOU UP A LITTLE WHILE I TALK.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
I'VE JUST HAD A WORD WITH SAITO.
THAT MAN'S THE WORST COMMANDING OFFICER I'VE EVER COME ACROSS.
ACTUALLY, I THINK HE'S MAD.
CARRY ON.
BLACKMAIL.
I KNOW, SIR, BUT HE MEANS IT.
I'M SURE HE DOES.
IT'S A QUESTION OF FACE, PURE AND SIMPLE, AND HE CAN'T GIVE IN.
IT'S STILL BLACKMAIL.
SIR, YOU CAN'T STAND MUCH MORE OF THIS.
AND WOULDN'T THE OFFICERS BE BETTER OFF WORKING...
THAN SUFFOCATING IN THAT HOLE ?
THE MEN ARE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB.
THEY'RE GOING AS SLOW ON IT AS THEY DARE.
BUT SAITO'S CUT THEIR FOOD RATIONS.
AND IF HE MAKES THE SICK MEN WORK,
WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO DIE;
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
YES, CLIPTON, I UNDERSTAND, TRULY.
BUT DON'T YOU SEE, IT'S A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE ?
IF WE GIVE IN NOW, THERE'LL BE NO END TO IT.
NO.
SIR, WE'RE LOST IN THE JUNGLE A THOUSAND MILES FROM ANYWHERE.
WE'RE UNDER THE HEEL OF A MAN WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET HIS WAY.
PRINCIPLE ?
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW OR CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO US.
GIVE IN, SIR.
PLEASE.
I'M ADAMANT.
I WILL NOT HAVE AN OFFICER FROM MY BATTALION WORKING AS A COOLIE.
TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
PLEASE THANK THOSE CONCERNED.
EVERYBODY IN THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTED ONE PIECE.
REYNOLDS STOLE THE COCONUT.
OH.
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM TIME TO TIME.
WE'VE BRIBED ONE OF YOUR GUARDS.
GOOD-BYE, SIR, AND GOOD LUCK.
MANY THANKS.
CLIPTON !
SIR ?
DID YOU SAY THAT AMERICAN CHAP WAS KILLED ?
YES, SIR.
SHOT AND DROWNED.
HMM.
IT'S INSANE TO PLAN ESCAPES.
THREE MEN KILLED, AND TO WHAT END ?
TIME.
HERE.
HERE'S WHERE WE MUST WIN THROUGH.
TIME.
TIME.
THE DOC JUST LOOKED AT US AND SHOOK HIS HEAD, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
MEANS ONLY ONE THING:
THE COLONEL WON'T GIVE IN.
WELL ?
IT'S LIKE THIS:
COL.
NICHOLSON WON'T GIVE IN TO FORCE.
IT'S A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE.
AS MEDICAL OFFICER, I MUST PROTEST TO THE WAY HE'S BEING TREATED.
IT'S A WONDER HE'S STILL ALIVE.
SHOULD A TRAGEDY OCCUR, IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO MURDER.
HE IS RESPONSIBLE, NOT I.
YOU SICK ?
ARE THEY BOTH MAD...
OR AM I GOING MAD ?
OR IS IT THE SUN ?

- ATTENTION !
BATTALION, ATTENTION !
ENGLISH PRISONERS, LET US ASK THE QUESTION:
WHY DOES THE BRIDGE NOT PROGRESS ?
YOU KNOW WHY.
BECAUSE YOUR OFFICERS ARE LAZY !
THEY THINK THEMSELVES TOO GOOD TO SHARE YOUR BURDENS.
THIS IS NOT JUST.
THEREFORE, YOU ARE NOT HAPPY IN YOUR WORK.
THEREFORE, THE BRIDGE DOES NOT PROGRESS.
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CAUSE.
I DO NOT HIDE THE TRUTH.
WITH DEEP SHAME AND REGRET, I ADMIT TO YOU...
THE FAILURE OF A MEMBER OF THE JAPANESE STAFF.
I REFER TO LT.
MIURA.
HE'S A BAD ENGINEER.
HE'SUNWORTHYOF COMMAND.
THEREFORE, I HAVE REMOVED HIM FROM HIS POST.
TOMORROW WE BEGIN AGAIN.
I SHALL BE IN PERSONAL COMMAND.
TODAY WE REST.
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKE JACK A DULL BOY.
AS TOKEN OF REGARD FOR YOUR EFFORT IN THE FUTURE,
I GIVE PRESENTS TO YOU ALL.
[ Shouts In Japanese ]
LET US BE HAPPY IN OUR WORK.
COMPANY...
DISMISS.
BATTALION, DISMISSED !
[ Men Cheering ]
HEY, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS !

HEY, LARRY, LOOK.
THEY'RE LETTING THE OLD MAN OUT.
MOST LIKELY GONNA GIVE HIM ANOTHER PASTING.
[ Knocking ] [ Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
GOOD EVENING, COLONEL.
[ Speaks Japanese ]
DO YOU MIND SITTING OVER HERE ?
I AM HAVING RATHER A LATE SUPPER.
[ Animals Wailing ]
ENGLISH CORNED BEEF.
NO, THANK YOU.
PRODUCE OF, UH, SCOTLAND.
I PREFER IT TO SAKE.
I SPENT THREE YEARS IN LONDON, YOU KNOW ?
I STUDIED AT THE LONDON POLYTECHNIC.
CHEERS.
I'M SORRY.
LATER, PERHAPS ?
PERHAPS.
I WAS NOT A GOOD ARTIST.
MY FATHER DISAPPROVED.
HE FELT I BELONGED IN THE ARMY,
SO I CHANGED FROM ART TO ENGINEERING.
I MUST TELL YOU, COLONEL...
SAITO,
I INTEND TO MAKE A FULL REPORT OF YOUR ACTIVITIES IN THIS CAMP.
I DO NOT THINK YOU QUITE REALIZE MY POSITION.
I MUST CARRY OUT MY ORDERS.
OH, QUITE.
QUITE.
MY ORDERS ARE TO COMPLETE THE BRIDGE...
BY THE 12th DAY OF MAY.
TIME IS SHORT.
I HAVE ONLY 12 WEEKS MORE.
NO DOUBT.
THEREFORE, I AM COMPELLED TO USE ALL AVAILABLE PERSONNEL.
BUT NO OFFICERS, EXCEPT IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY.
BUT OFFICERS ARE WORKING ALONG THE ENTIRE RAILWAY !
YOU KNOW IT !
I KNOW IT !
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF OTHER COMMANDING OFFICERS.
PERSONALLY, I'M APPALLED.
BETTER NOT GET EXCITED.
WILL YOU HAVE A CIGAR ?
NO, THANK YOU.
WHEN I SAID ALL OFFICERS MUST WORK,
NATURALLY I NEVER MEANT YOU, THE COMMANDING OFFICER.
MY ORDERS WERE ONLY INTENDED FOR OFFICERS BELOW--
NONE OF MY OFFICERS WILL DO MANUAL LABOR.
PLEASE.
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY...
I HAVE BEEN THINKING THE MATTER OVER...
AND DECIDED TO PUT MAJORS AND ABOVE ON ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES,
LEAVING ONLY THE JUNIOR OFFICERS TO LEND A HAND.
I'M AFRAID NOT.
THE CONVENTION'S QUITE CLEAR ON THAT POINT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME...
IF THE BRIDGE IS NOT READY IN TIME ?
I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST.
I'LL HAVE TO KILL MYSELF.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU ARE ME ?
I SUPPOSE, IF I WERE YOU,
I'D HAVE TO KILL MYSELF.
CHEERS.
I WARN YOU, COLONEL,
IF I AM TO DIE, OTHERS WILL DIE BEFORE ME.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ?
MAJOR CLIPTON DID MENTION SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.
WELL ?
THAT WON'T SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM,
BUT I'M SURE WE CAN ARRIVE AT A PROPER SOLUTION.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
NOW, TELL ME, UH, COLONEL,
DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT AGREE THAT THE FIRST JOB OF AN OFFICER IS COMMAND ?
OF COURSE.
GOOD.
[ Sighs ]
TAKE THIS BRIDGE OF YOURS.
IT'S QUITE AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING,
AND TO BE FRANK, I HAVE GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER YOUR LIEUTENANT--
UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME ?
MIURA.
MIURA, HMM.
IS CAPABLE OF TACKLING A JOB OF SUCH IMPORTANCE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE OFFICERS-
- REEVES AND HUGHES, FOR INSTANCE--
WHO HAVE BUILT BRIDGES ALL OVER INDIA.
[ Sighs ]
THE MEN RESPECT THEM.
IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR AN OFFICER TO HAVE THAT RESPECT.
I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE.
IF HE LOSES IT, HE CEASES TO COMMAND.
AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN ?
DEMORALIZATION AND CHAOS.
AND A PRETTY POOR COMMANDER I WOULD BE IF I ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN TO MY MEN.
PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT AWARE...
THAT THE BRIDGE IS NOW UNDER MY PERSONAL COMMAND.
REALLY ?
AND MAY I ASK, ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE WORK ?
I AM NOT !
YOU PROVE MY POINT.
I HATE THE BRITISH !
YOU'RE DEFEATED, BUT YOU HAVE NO SHAME.
YOU ARE STUBBORN, BUT HAVE NO PRIDE.
YOU ENDURE, BUT YOU HAVE NO COURAGE.
I HATE THE BRITISH !
POINTLESS GOING ON LIKE THIS.
STAY THERE !
[ Shouts In Japanese ] [ Soldier Responds ]

[ Man Shouting In Japanese ]

BATTALION, ATTENTION !
BATTALION, STAND AT EASE !
PLEASE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DATE TODAY, COLONEL ?
I'M AFRAID I'VE LOST COUNT.
IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF OUR GREAT VICTORY OVER RUSSIA IN 1905.
OH, YES.
THROUGHOUT EAST ASIA, WE ARE CELEBRATING THIS DATE.
IN HONOR OF THIS OCCASION,
I HAVE GIVEN YOUR TROOPS A DAY OF REST.
MANY THANKS.
I'M DECLARING A GENERAL AMNESTY.
YOU AND YOUR OFFICERS MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.
AS PART OF THIS AMNESTY,
IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR OFFICERS TO DO MANUAL LABOR.
[ Grunts ]
HE'S DONE IT.
[ Cheering ]
[ Cheering Continues ]
[ Crying ]
SOMEBODY DESERVES A MEDAL, SIR.
HMM.
HOW MANY MEN IN YOUR PARTY, CORPORAL ?
WELL, I DON'T REALLY KNOW, SIR.
YOU DON'T KNOW ?
OH, SIR, 12 USUALLY,
BUT ONE OF THE MEN TOOK SICK VERY SUDDENLY THIS MORNING.
HE TOOK THREE OR MAYBE FOUR OF THE OTHERS TO HELP HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.
AND, UH, HE JUST TOOK TERRIBLE SICK, SIR.
A CORPORAL SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY MEN HE HAS UNDER HIM AT ALL TIMES.
OH, YES, SIR.
HAVE YOU A NERVOUS AFFLICTION ?
IF NOT, STOP MAKING THOSE FACES AT ONCE.
IT MAY BE FUNNY, AND I'M SURE IT'S DONE WITH THE BEST MOTIVES BUT IT'S NOT MILITARY BEHAVIOR.
NO, SIR.
[ Men Shouting, Cheering ]
WE MUST PUT A STOP TO THESE DEMONSTRATIONS.
YES, SIR.
I SAY, REEVES.
YES, SIR.
HAVE YOU EVER CONSTRUCTED A BRIDGE ACROSS A STREAM LIKE THE KWAI ?
YES, SIR.
HALF A DOZEN OF THEM, IN MADRAS AND BENGAL.
IF THIS WERE YOUR BRIDGE,
HOW WOULD YOU GET IT UNDERWAY ?
GET IT UNDERWAY, SIR ?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WOULDN'T BUILD IT HERE.
OH ?
WHY NOT ?
AS I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU A WHILE AGO, SIR,
THE JAPANESE COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A WORSE LOCATION.
THERE'S NO BOTTOM.
YOU SEE THOSE PILES ?
THEY'RE SINKING.
OUR CHAPS COULD DRIVE THOSE LOGS TILL DOOMSDAY AND THEY WOULDN'T HOLD.
WHERE WOULD YOU BUILD IT ?
WHY, FURTHER DOWNSTREAM, SIR, ACROSS THOSE NARROWS.
THEN WE'D HAVE SOLID BEDROCK ON BOTH BANKS.
HUGHES, IF THIS WERE YOUR BRIDGE, HOW WOULD YOU USE THE MEN ?
[ Chuckles ] WELL, SIR, NOT THE WAY THEY'RE DOING IT.
IT'S UTTER CHAOS AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE GLANCE.
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCOORDINATED ACTIVITY-
- NO TEAMWORK.
SOME OF THOSE PARTIES ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AGAINST EACH OTHER.
YES.
I TELL YOU, GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS.
THANKS TO THE JAPANESE, WE NOW COMMAND A RABBLE.
THERE'S NO ORDER, NO DISCIPLINE.
[ Whistles ]
OUR TASK IS TO REBUILD THE BATTALION.
YES, SIR.
IT ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY, BUT FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE THE MEANS AT HAND-
- THE BRIDGE.
THE BRIDGE, SIR ?
THE BRIDGE.
WE CAN TEACH THESE BARBARIANS A LESSON IN WESTERN METHODS AND EFFICIENCY...
THAT WILL PUT THEM TO SHAME.
WE'LL SHOW THEM WHAT THE BRITISH SOLDIER IS CAPABLE OF DOING.
YES.
I SEE YOUR POINT, SIR.
I REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT IT'S GOING TO BE IN THIS GODFORSAKEN PLACE...
WHERE YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU NEED, BUT THERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.
YOU MEAN YOU REALLY WANT THEM TO BUILD A BRIDGE ?
YOU'RE NOT USUALLY SO SLOW IN THE UPTAKE, EVANS.
I KNOW OUR MEN.
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM OCCUPIED.
IF THERE WEREN'T ANY WORK FOR THEM TO DO, WE'D INVENT SOME, EH, REEVES ?
THAT WE WOULD, SIR.
SO WE'RE LUCKY.
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A PROPER BRIDGE.
NOW HERE AGAIN, I KNOW THE MEN.
IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A PRIDE IN THEIR JOB.
RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
REEVES, YOU'RE THE KEY MAN IN THIS SITUATION AS ENGINEER.
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, AND HUGHES AND I WILL ORGANIZE IT.
CAN WE MAKE A GO OF IT ?
WE'LL DO OUR BEST.
FINE.
WE MUST DRAW UP OUR PLANS,
THEN ARRANGE A CONFERENCE WITH SAITO...
AND SET HIM STRAIGHT.
WELL, I THINK THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE PROCEDURAL MATTERS.
NOW-
- OH, YES.
THE NEXT POINT IS SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANT FOR ALL CONCERNED, I'M AFRAID.
WE FEEL THE POSITION OF THE BRIDGE WAS FIXED RATHER HASTILY...
AND, I HAVE TO ADD, INCORRECTLY.
INCORRECTLY ?
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.
MAJOR REEVES, OUR ENGINEER, HAS MADE A CAREFUL STUDY...
AND HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE RIVER BOTTOM THERE IS TOO SOFT.
TOO SOFT ?
MUD.
ALL THE WORK UP TO NOW HAS BEEN QUITE USELESS.
REEVES, WILL YOU CARRY ON ?
YES, SIR.
COLONEL SAITO, I'VE MADE TESTS,
AND THOSE PILES OF YOURS COULD BE HAMMERED BELOW WATER LEVEL BEFORE THEY'D HOLD.
THAT BRIDGE WOULD COLLAPSE UNDER THE FIRST TRAIN TO CROSS IT.
LOOK, IT'S ALL HERE.
PRESSURE AND SOIL RESISTANCE FIGURES IN TONS PER SQUARE INCH.
JUST A MOMENT, REEVES, BEFORE YOU GET TOO INVOLVED.
COLONEL, DO YOU SUPPOSE WE COULD HAVE A CUP OF TEA ?
[ Japanese ]
[ Japanese Continues ]
AND I TAKE IT WE ALL AGREE THAT, IF WE'RE TO AVOID DISASTER,
WE BUILD A NEW BRIDGE AT THE SITE SELECTED BY MAJOR REEVES, 400 YARDS DOWNSTREAM.
SO LET'S PROCEED TO THE NEXT POINT.
I'VE DECIDED TO ALTER THE DAILY WORK QUOTA OF OUR MEN.
ALTER ?
YES, I'VE INCREASED IT...
FROM A YARD AND A HALF OF EARTH MOVED TO TWO YARDS.
IT'S IN THE GENERAL INTEREST, AND I'M SURE IT WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL.
MAJOR HUGHES HAS THE FACTS AND FIGURES.
HUGHES, WILL YOU TAKE OVER ?
YES, SIR.
I'VE DONE A TIME STUDY OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT.
AS YOU CAN SEE AT A GLANCE, THE AVAILABLE FORCES HAVE BEEN BADLY DISTRIBUTED.
I STRONGLY URGE WE REVISE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WORKING PARTIES.
JUST A MOMENT.
YOU KNOW, COLONEL, IT WOULD SAVE CONSIDERABLE TIME...
IF WE COULD CARRY ON WORKING DURING DINNER.
DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A MEAL HERE ?
OF COURSE.
[ Japanese ]
CARRY ON, HUGHES.
YES, SIR.
IF WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SQUADS AND SPECIALIZE THE FUNCTIONS OF EACH,
I'M CERTAIN THAT THE TOTAL DAILY OUTPUT CAN BE INCREASED BY 30%.
AND NOW, COL.
SAITO, I HAVE ONE MORE POINT.
NOW, THERE'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT DECISION THAT CAN'T BE POSTPONED.
AS MOST OF THE BRITISH SOLDIERS WILL BE WORKING ON THE BRIDGE,
ONLY A SMALL NUMBER WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR RAILWAY WORK.
I MUST ASK YOU TO LEND US SOME OF YOUR OWN MEN TO REINFORCE THE RAILWAY GANG...
SO THAT THE FINAL STRETCH OF TRACK CAN BE COMPLETED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE ORDER.
WELL,YOUMUSTFIX THEDAILYWORKQUOTA FORYOURMEN.
ITHOUGHTOF SETTINGIT ATA YARDANDAHALF , SOASNOTTOOVERTIRETHEM.
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE MADE IT THE SAME AS THE BRITISH SOLDIERS ?
THAT WOULD ALSO CREATE A HEALTHY COMPETITIVE SPIRIT.
I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE ORDER.
WE'LL TRY TO SURPASS THAT, WON'T WE, HUGHES ?
YES, SIR.
I THINK THAT COMPLETES THE AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING.
IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO SAY THANK YOU, COL.
SAITO, FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,
AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ?
ONE QUESTION.
CAN YOU FINISH THE BRIDGE IN TIME ?
FRANKLY, THE CONSENSUS OF OPINION IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY GIVE IT A GO.
AFTER ALL, WE MUSTN'T FORGET THAT WE'VE WASTED OVER A MONTH...
THROUGH AN UNFORTUNATE DISAGREEMENT, FOR WHICH I WAS NOT TO BLAME.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ?
NO.
THANK YOU.
THE MEETING IS CLOSED.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
I HOPE THESE JAPANESE APPRECIATE WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THEM.
FOR THE MOMENT, I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH THEIR APPRECIATION.
GOOD NIGHT, CLIPTON.
GOOD NIGHT.
BY THE WAY, SIR, I MEANT TO TELL YOU.
THERE ARE TREES IN THIS FOREST VERY SIMILAR TO ELM.
AND THE ELM PILES OF LONDON BRIDGE LASTED 600 YEARS.
SIX HUNDRED YEARS, REEVES ?
YES,SIR.
SIX HUNDRED YEARS.
THAT WOULD BE QUITE SOMETHING.
GOOD MORNING, I'M LOOKING FOR AN AMERICAN NAMED COMMANDER SHEARS.
OH, YES.
DOWN ON THE BEACH.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
KISS !
[ Laughs ] TOO MANY EYES.
THEY GIVE ME POWDERS, PILLS, BATHS, INJECTIONS, ENEMAS,
WHEN ALL I NEED IS LOVE.
IT'S TRUE.
ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS LOVE.
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE YOU'LL GET A MEDICAL DISCHARGE ?
BECAUSE I'M A CIVILIAN AT HEART, LOVER, AND I ALWAYS FOLLOW MY HEART.
KISS.
HOW'S THAT, COMMANDER ?
OH, DON'T CALL ME COMMANDER.
IT'S UNROMANTIC.
LOOK.
YOU'RE AN OFFICER YOURSELF.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I CALLED YOU "LIEUTENANT LOVER" ?
LET'S BE DEMOCRATIC.
JUST CALL ME "SIR." YES, SIR.
[ShearsSighs] [Woman] LOOK.
BRASSAHOY.
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU, AND HE'S ALL YOURS.
I'M GOING FOR A SWIM.
DON'T LEAVE ME !
COMMANDER SHEARS ?
YES.
MY NAME'S WARDEN.
HOW DO YOU DO ?
SORRY TO INTRUDE--
THAT'S OKAY, MAJOR.
I'M USED TO IT BY NOW.
LIKE A MARTINI ?
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, BUT I THINK NOT.
MIND IF I HAVE ONE ?
NO.
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET THAT ?
THIS IS A HOSPITAL, MAJOR.
WHERE THERE'S A HOSPITAL, THERE'S ALCOHOL.
YES, OF COURSE.
JOLLY GOOD.
LOOK.
I'LL BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE.
I BELONG TO A RATHER RUM GROUP CALLED FORCE 316.
OUR HEADQUARTERS IS UP IN THE BOTANICAL GARDENS.
PROTECTING RARE PLANTS FROM THE ENEMY ?
NOT QUITE.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T HAVE A MARTINI ?
NO.
NO, THANKS.
AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THAT RAILWAY YOU WORKED ON,
AND YOU COULD GIVE US NO END OF VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION.
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAJOR, I'M LEAVING FOR THE STATES IN A FEW DAYS,
AND I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOUR INTELLIGENT PEOPLE EVERYTHING I KNOW.
YES, BUT YOU COULD HELP US IN A RATHER SPECIAL SENSE.
I KNOW IT'S A TERRIBLE IMPOSITION,
BUT I WONDER IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY COME OUT AND SEE US.
[ Sighs ] WELL, YOU WANNA GO OVER THE WHOLE THING AGAIN, I'LL COME.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
LORD LOUIS WILL BE MOST GRATEFUL.
LORD WHO ?
AT MOUNTBATTEN, WE'RE ONE OF HIS SPECIAL PIGEONS.
OH, I SEE.
SHALL WE SAY THIS EVENING ABOUT 8:00 ?
I'LL SEND A CAR FOR YOU.
THIS EVENING ?
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
WELL, TOMORROW MORNING THEN ABOUT 10:00.
OKAY, 10:00.
OH, THANKS VERY MUCH.
CHEERIO.
CHEERIO.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE TERRIBLY SORRY, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO STAND ME UP TONIGHT.
YOU COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.
[ Officer Shouting Orders ]

MAY I SEE YOUR PASS, SIR, PLEASE ?
OH, YES.

I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, SIR.
YOU'RESORRY.
SO AM I, SIR.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ENEMY, SIR.
WELL, I'M AN AMERICAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.
THAT WILL BE ALL, JOYCE.
YES, SIR.
SORRY, SIR.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, SIR ?
WELL, I WAS ON MY WAY TO SEE MAJOR WARDEN.
I'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY.
HE SHOULD BE FINISHING HIS LECTURE AT ANY MOMENT.
[Explosion]
THAT'S THE END OF MAJOR WARDEN'S LECTURE, SIR.
THUNDEROUS OVATION.
THE MAJOR BELIEVES IN KEEPING OUR TRAINING AS CLOSE TO REAL LIFE AS POSSIBLE, SIR.
MAJOR WARDEN, SIR.
YES ?
VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME ALONG.
I HOPE WE'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF YOU.
OH, THEY CERTAINLY HAVE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
WELL, COME ALONG THEN.
COLONEL GREEN IS LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.
OH ?
FASCINATING PLACE, ISN'T IT ?
UTTERLY CHARMING.
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A COMMANDO SCHOOL.
WE'RE TRYING TO DISCOURAGE THE USE OF THAT WORD.
IT'S COME TO HAVE SUCH A MELODRAMATIC AIR ABOUT IT.
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE, MAJOR ?
SABOTAGE, DEMOLITION.
THAT LINE OF COUNTRY.
WE'RE USING P.E.-- PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES.
WONDERFUL STUFF.
THAT LAST LITTLE POP WAS MADE WITH A LUMP HALF THE SIZE OF THIS.
IT'S TWICE AS POWERFUL AS GELIGNITE AND ONLY HALF THE WEIGHT.
HERE.
OH !
IT'S QUITE HARMLESS UNTIL IT'S DETONATED.
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.
IT'S COMPLETELY WATERPROOF, AND ACTUALLY PLASTIC.
SEE ?
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH IT.
THIS IS MY PLACE.
GO AHEAD.
[ Bell Dings ]
WOULD YOU CARE FOR ONE ?
NO, THANKS.
A DRINK ?
NO, THANK YOU.
SPOT OF TEA FOR ONE, PLEASE, PETER.
VERY WELL, SIR.
YOU READ THIS ?
OH, I TAUGHT ORIENTAL LANGUAGES AT CAMBRIDGE BEFORE THE WAR.
BY THE WAY, I NEVER CONGRATULATED YOU ON YOUR ESCAPE.
IT WAS A GOOD SHOW, I MUST SAY.
I WAS LUCKY.
IF YOUR SEA RESCUE PLANE HADN'T SPOTTED ME, I WOULDN'T BE HERE.
NO, I SUPPOSE NOT.
[ Clears Throat ]
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHERE YOU WERE ?
ALL RIGHT.
OUR INFORMATION'S RATHER SCANTY.
IT'S MOSTLY BASED ON YOUR REPORT.
BUT WE THINK THE CAMP IS ABOUT HERE.
DO YOUR PEOPLE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT COL.
NICHOLSON ?
NO.
HE HAD THE GUTS OF A MANIAC.
THEY WERE ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM, AND HE DIDN'T BAT AN EYE.
IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE SHOT, THERE ISN'T A GREAT DEAL YOU CAN DO, IS THERE ?
HERE IS THE RIVER KWAI, AND HERE IS THE SIAMESE VILLAGE WHERE YOU WERE HELPED.
AND HERE IS THE RAILWAY.
BUT THEN, YOU MUST BE FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL THIS AREA.
OH, NOT REALLY.
I WAS OUT OF MY HEAD HALF THE TIME.
NOW, THE RAILWAY STARTS DOWN HERE IN SINGAPORE.
MALAYA, BANGKOK, RANGOON.
THEIR IDEA IS TO DRIVE ON THROUGH INTO INDIA.
HMM.
WHERE WAS I PICKED UP ?
OH, UM, ABOUT HERE.
AS YOU KNOW, THE JAPANESE AIM TO OPEN THE BANGKOK/RANGOON SECTION BY THE MIDDLE OF MAY.
NATURALLY, WE'RE GONNA TRY AND PREVENT THEM.
IT'S TOO FAR FOR BOMBERS TO CARRY AN ADEQUATE LOAD.
SO WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN AND SMASH IT UP ON THE GROUND.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET THERE ?
PARACHUTE DROP AND THEN MARCH.
WITH DEMOLITION EQUIPMENT THROUGH THAT JUNGLE ?
YES.
OUR CHIEF PROBLEM IS LACK OF FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE.
YOU SEE, NONE OF US HAVE EVER BEEN THERE.
I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU, MAJOR, BUT-- IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
COLONEL GREEN HAS GIVEN ME THE KWAI BRIDGE.
I'M GOING TO TAKE A TEAM IN AND BLOW IT UP.
LUCKY YOU.
UH, ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T HAVE A CUP OF TEA ?
NO, THANKS.
LOOK, MAJOR, I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE,
BUT I'VE GOT A LUNCHEON DATE AT 2:00 AND SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
SO IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS-- YES, OF COURSE.
I AM SORRY.
WELL, THERE IS ONLY ONE QUESTION, ACTUALLY.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING BACK ?
COME AGAIN.
I KNOW UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S A BIT MUCH,
BUT YOU DO HAVE A UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE FOR OUR PURPOSE...
AND WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT ME HERE ?
TO ASK ME THIS ?
WELL, FRANKLY, YES.
MAJOR, I JUST GOT OUT OF THERE.
MY ESCAPE WAS A MIRACLE.
EVEN YOUR PEOPLE SAID SO.
NOW YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK ?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING.
I CAN'T GO BACK.
I BELONG TO THE AMERICAN NAVY.
OF COURSE.
ACTUALLY, COL.
GREEN HAS ALREADY TAKEN THE MATTER UP WITH YOUR PEOPLE.
WITH MY PEOPLE ?
YES, YOUR NAVY'S TURNED YOU OVER TO US.
A SIGNAL ARRIVED YESTERDAY MORNING FROM YOUR C IN C PACIFIC...
AUTHORIZING YOUR TEMPORARY TRANSFER OF DUTY TO FORCE 316.
THEY CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
I'M AFRAID THEY HAVE.
IT WAS AWFULLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW TO BREAK IT TO YOU.
THEY CAN'T DO THIS.
I MEAN IT.
MY NAVY'S MADE A MISTAKE.
YOUR WHO ?
I'M NOT A NAVY COMMANDER.
I'M NOT EVEN AN OFFICER.
OH ?
THE WHOLE THING'S A FAKE.
I'M JUST AN ORDINARY SWAB JOCKEY, SECOND CLASS.
OH.
WHEN THE HOUSTON SUNK, I MADE IT ASHORE WITH AN OFFICER-- A REAL COMMANDER.
LATER ON, WE RAN INTO A JAPANESE PATROL AND HE WAS KILLED.
I FIGURED IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I WAS CAPTURED, SO--
SO YOU CHANGED UNIFORMS WITH A DEAD MAN.
I THOUGHT OFFICERS WOULD GET BETTER TREATMENT IN PRISON CAMPS.
THAT'S VERY SENSIBLE.
NOT THAT IT DID ME ANY GOOD.
AT SAITO'S CAMP, THE OFFICER'S WORKED ALONG WITH THE REST.
THERE'S ALWAYS THE UNEXPECTED, ISN'T THERE ?
I KIND OF GOT USED TO BEING A COMMANDER,
AND SO, WHEN I ARRIVED HERE AT THE HOSPITAL,
I TOOK A LOOK AT THE ENLISTED MEN'S WARD,
AND I TOOK A LOOK AT THE OFFICER'S WARD...
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,
"OH, LET'S LET IT RIDE ALONG FOR A WHILE." THERE WERE DEFINITE ADVANTAGES.
YES, I SAW ONE OF THEM ON THE BEACH.
ANYWAY, THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY.
THE POINT OF IT IS, YOU CAN'T USE ME.
YOU WANT AN OFFICER FOR YOUR TEAM.
AN AMERICAN COMMANDER NAMED SHEARS DOESN'T EXIST !
WHEN THE NAVY BRASS LEARNS THE TRUTH, THEY'LL SAY,
"SHIP HIM HOME IN IRONS FOR IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER."
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, I'VE GOT IT MADE.
YOU'VE GOT IT WHAT ?
MADE.
I'D LIKE THAT DRINK NOW.
YES, OF COURSE.
I'LL APPLY FOR A MEDICAL DISCHARGE.
I'LL TELL THEM THAT I IMPERSONATED AN OFFICER...
BECAUSE I WENT OFF MY ROCKER IN THE JUNGLE.
I'M GETTING WORSE, YOU KNOW.
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M ADMIRAL HALSEY.
WELL, THAT'S QUITE A CLEVER PLAN.
IT'S NOT ONLY CLEVER.
IT'S FOOLPROOF.
WHEN MY NAVY FINDS OUT WHO I AM,
THOSE TEMPORARY ORDERS YOU'VE GOT WON'T BE WORTH THE PAPER THEY'RE WRITTEN ON.
THIS IS YOUR PHOTOGRAPH, ISN'T IT ?
-WHERE DID YOU GET THIS ?
-SORRY.
IT TOOK A BIT OF DOING.
NATURALLY, YOUR PEOPLE COULDN'T IDENTIFY YOU AT FIRST.
BUT FINALLY C IN C PACIFIC SENT US A COPY OF YOUR SERVICE RECORD.
THE PHOTOGRAPH, THE FINGERPRINTS, EVERYTHING.
-WOULD YOU CARE TO HAVE A LOOK ?
-NO.
YOU SEE, WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT YOUR ACTUAL RANK FOR NEARLY A WEEK.
YOUR NAVY'S IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.
IN ONE SENSE, YOU'RE A BLASTED HERO...
FOR MAKING AN ESCAPE FROM THE JUNGLE.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CAN'T VERY WELL BRING YOU HOME...
AND GIVE YOU TO THE NAVY CROSS FOR IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER.
I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY THEY WERE SO HAPPY TO HAND YOU OVER TO US.
YOU SEE ?
HOT POTATO.
AS FAR AS YOUR PRESENT RANK IS CONCERNED,
WE'RE FAIRLY INFORMAL ABOUT THOSE THINGS IN FORCE 316.
SO YOU'LL HAVE A SIMULATED RANK OF MAJOR.
A SIMULATED MAJOR.
THAT FIGURES.
WELL.
AS LONG AS I'M HOOKED, I MIGHT AS WELL VOLUNTEER.
GOOD SHOW.
[KnockAt Door]
OH, COL.
GREEN, SIR.
THIS IS MAJOR SHEARS.
HE'S JUST VOLUNTEERED TO GO BACK AND HELP ME BLOW UP THE KWAI BRIDGE.
REALLY ?
GOOD SHOW.
JOLLY GOOD SHOW, MAJOR.
GET UP TO SICK BAY, BAKER.
THIS FOOT'S INFECTED.
THE COLONEL MIGHT THINK I'M MALINGERIN', SIR.
I'M THE MEDICAL OFFICER, BAKER.
GET CRACKING.
WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THE OLD MAN WANTS US TO BUILD A PROPER BRIDGE ?
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT OLD NICK.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.
HELLO, CLIPTON.
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU'VE PAID US A VISIT.
FINE JOB OUR CHAPS ARE DOING.
REALLY FIRST RATE.
YES.
HOW'S HE BEHAVING ?
I MUST SAY, HE'S BEEN MOST REASONABLE SINCE WE TOOK OVER.
I WONDER WHAT HE'S THINKING.
I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST.
THANKS, REEVES.
RIGHT, SIR.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
QUITEA CHALLENGE, ISN'TIT?
SIR, ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT BUILDING THIS BRIDGE IS A GOOD IDEA ?
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?
YES, SIR.
A GOOD IDEA ?
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK, CLIPTON.
YOU DON'T AGREE THAT THE MEN'S MORALE IS HIGH,
THAT DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN RESTORED,
THAT THEIR CONDITION HAS BEEN IMPROVED ?
ARE THEY A HAPPIER LOT OR AREN'T THEY ?
YES, SIR, BUT--
THEY FEEL BETTER, AND THEY ARE NO LONGER ABUSED OR MALTREATED.
THAT'S ALL TRUE.
WELL, THEN.
HONESTLY, CLIPTON, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL.
I'LL TRY TO MAKE MYSELF CLEAR, SIR.
THE FACT IS, WHAT WE'RE DOING COULD BE CONSTRUED AS--
FORGIVE ME, SIR-- COLLABORATION WITH THE ENEMY.
PERHAPS EVEN AS TREASONABLE ACTIVITY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, CLIPTON ?
WE ARE PRISONERS OF WAR.
WE HAVEN'T THE RIGHT TO REFUSE WORK.
I UNDERSTAND THAT, SIR, BUT MUST WE WORK SO WELL ?
MUST WE BUILD THEM A BETTER BRIDGE THAN THEY COULD HAVE BUILT FOR THEMSELVES ?
IF YOU HAD TO OPERATE ON SAITO, WOULD YOU DO YOUR BEST OR LET HIM DIE ?
WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE THIS BATTALION DISINTEGRATE IN IDLENESS ?
WOULD YOU HAVE IT SAID THAT OUR CHAPS CAN'T DO A PROPER JOB ?
DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SHOW THESE PEOPLE...
THAT THEY CAN'T BREAK US IN BODY OR IN SPIRIT ?
TAKE A GOOD LOOK, CLIPTON.
ONEDAY, THEWARWILLBEOVER ,
ANDI HOPETHATTHE PEOPLE WHOUSETHISBRIDGE INYEARSTO COME...
WILL REMEMBER HOW IT WAS BUILT AND WHO BUILT IT.
NOT A GANG OF SLAVES, BUT SOLDIERS--
BRITISH SOLDIERS, CLIPTON, EVEN IN CAPTIVITY.
YES, SIR.
YOU'RE A FINE DOCTOR, CLIPTON,
BUT YOU'VE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE ARMY.
[ Officer Shouting Instructions ]
HOLD IT !
HOLD IT !
USE YOUR BOOT !
GET YOUR BOOT IN THERE !
REALLY GOOD.
[ Wolf Whistle ]
GOOD MORNING.
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU PEOPLE STARING AT ?
GET ON WITH YOUR JOBS !
NOW GET HIM WITH YOUR BOOT !
I'M AWFULLY SORRY I'M LATE, SIR.
FOUR MINUTES LATE TO BE EXACT.
YOU WERE IN NEED OF MEDICAL ATTENTION ?
SIR ?
I WAS REFERRING TO THE NURSE.
OH.
OH, YES.
VERY INGENIOUS.
WARDEN WAS RIGHT.
SIT DOWN.
[ Bell Dings ]
THE REASON I ASKED YOU HERE WAS TO HELP US PICK THE FOURTH MEMBER OF YOUR TEAM.
ASK MR. JOYCE TO COME IN.
SIR.
CHAPMAN HERE WANTS JOYCE, BUT I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT HIM.
I THINK HE HAS TOO MUCH IMAGINATION AS DISTINCT FROM COLD CALCULATION.
AS I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE, IN A JOB LIKE YOURS, EVEN WHEN IT'S FINISHED,
THERE'S ALWAYS ONE MORE THING TO DO.
HE'S THE BEST SWIMMER IN THE SCHOOL, AND WE'LL NEED A GOOD SWIMMER.
I'M WELL AWARE OF YOUR EVALUATION, CHAPMAN.
THE OPINION I WANT IS SHEARS'.
ALL RIGHT.
AT EASE.
THESE GENTLEMEN ARE THINKING OF TAKING YOU FOR A LITTLE HIKE INTO THE JUNGLE.
YES, SIR.
YOU WERE AN ACCOUNTANT IN MONTREAL.
YES, SIR.
NOT REALLY AN ACCOUNTANT, SIR.
THAT IS, I DIDN'T HAVE MY CHARTER.
YEAH ?
EXACTLY WHAT DID YOU DO THEN ?
WELL, SIR, I JUST CHECKED COLUMNS AND COLUMNS OF FIGURES...
WHICH THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAD CHECKED BEFORE ME.
AND THEN THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO CHECKED THEM AFTER I HAD CHECKED THEM.
- SOUNDS A FRIGHTFUL BORE.
- SIR, IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL BORE.
HOW DID YOU WIND UP HERE ?
IN '39, I CAME TO LONDON TO ENLIST,
AND ABOUT TWO YEARS LATER, I VOLUNTEERED FOR THIS WORK.
YOU VOLUNTEERED ?
YES, SIR.
YOU SEE, THE REGULAR ARMY--
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN BE FRANK.
WELL, SIR, THE REGULAR ARMY SORT OF REMINDED ME OF MY JOB IN CIVILIAN LIFE.
THEY DON'T EXPECT YOU TO THINK.
THINK ABOUT THIS.
ARE YOU QUITE SURE YOU'D BE ABLE TO USE THIS IN COLD BLOOD ?
- I KNOW HOW TO USE IT, SIR.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
COULD YOU USE IT IN COLD BLOOD ?
COULD YOU KILL WITHOUT HESITATION ?
THAT'S A QUESTION I'VE OFTEN ASKED MYSELF, SIR.
IT'S WORRIED ME QUITE A BIT.
WHAT WAS THE ANSWER ?
I DON'T HONESTLY KNOW, SIR.
I'VE TRIED TO IMAGINE MYSELF--
ISUPPOSEIFINDITHARD TOKIDMYSELFTHATKILLING ISN'TA CRIME.
IT'S AN OLD ARMY PROBLEM.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU, JOYCE.
-AM I TO GO WITH THE TEAM, SIR ?
-WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.
NOW, YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN.
WELL, AT LEAST HE WAS HONEST ABOUT IT, SIR.
NONE OF US KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION UNTIL THE MOMENT ARISES.
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ?
WELL, SIR, HE'S CANADIAN,
AND THAT'S IN KEEPING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMPOSITION OF THIS OUTFIT.
IF HE WANTS TO GO THAT BAD, HE CAN EVEN TAKE MY PLACE.
WELL, IF YOU'RE ALL AGREED ON JOYCE, HE'S YOURS.
NOW THEN.
I HAVE A REPORT FROM AIR RECONNAISSANCE ON THAT VILLAGE.
THERE'S SUFFICIENT CLEARING TO MAKE YOUR JUMP AT LAST LIGHT.
YOU'VE HAD PARACHUTE TRAINING, OF COURSE ?
NO, SIR.
BLAST.
THIS IS AWKWARD.
SILLY, IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME.
WELL, IN THAT CASE--
THE MAJOR'S RIGHT.
WE'D BETTER ARRANGE SOME PRACTICE JUMPS FOR HIM IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL CHECK WITH FREDDY RIGHT AWAY.
ALL RIGHT, CHAPMAN.
YOU CAN RUN ALONG.
YES, SIR.
WELL, THEN.
FEEL LIKE A SNIFF OF AIR ?
YES, SIR.
YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT A PLUM YOU ARE FOR US.
YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA, YOUR MAKING FRIENDS IN THAT VILLAGE.
IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOUR WHOLE ESCAPE HAD BEEN PLANNED WITH US IN MIND.
BY THE WAY, HERE'S SOMETHING THAT'LL INTEREST YOU.
THE NEW L PILL.
"L PILL" ?
"L" FOR LETHAL.
INSTANTANEOUS, PAINLESS.
MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES.
FOR CAPTURE, OF COURSE.
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE TELLING ME NOT TO BE TAKEN ALIVE.
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT.
IF ANY OF YOU GET HURT OR WOUNDED ON THE TREK,
THE OTHERS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND.
THE OBJECTIVE COMES FIRST IN OUR WORK.
COLONEL, YOU WANT MY HONEST EVALUATION OF THIS TEAM ?
I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS.
I UNDERSTAND.
GO AHEAD.
WELL, CHAPMAN WILL BE FINE-- ICE WATER IN HIS VEINS.
JOYCE IS-- HE'LL BE OKAY.
IT'S WARDEN I DON'T GET.
HUH ?
WHY NOT ?
CAMBRIDGE DON AND ALL OF THAT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING...
FOR HIM TO PLAY AROUND WITH EXPLOSIVES LIKE A KID WITH FIRECRACKERS, BUT--
HE'S NOT WITHOUT EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW.
WHEN WE LOST SINGAPORE, HE STAYED BEHIND AND BLEW UP A COUPLE OF BRIDGES,
TWO TRAINS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER INSTALLATIONS BEFORE THE JAPS CAUGHT HIM.
CAUGHT HIM ?
YES, FASCINATING STORY.
SIR, IT'S MOST ANNOYING.
IN VIEW OF THE TIME ELEMENT, THEY DON'T THINK A FEW PRACTICE JUMPS WOULD BE WORTHWHILE.
NO ?
THEY SAY IF YOU MAKE ONE JUMP,
YOU'VE ONLY GOT 50% CHANCE OF INJURY, TWO JUMPS, 80%...
AND THREE JUMPS, YOU'RE BOUND TO CATCH A BACKACHE.
THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THE MOST SENSIBLE THING FOR MAJOR SHEARS TO DO...
IS TO GO AHEAD AND JUMP AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
WITH OR WITHOUT PARACHUTE ?
[ Laughing ]
OH, VERY GOOD, OLD MAN.
[ Laughing Continues ]
"WITH OR WITHOUT--"
HE'S IN THE TREES.
YAI SAYS WE'LL NEVER REACH THE KWAI BY THE ROUTE YOU TOOK.
THERE ARE TOO MANY JAPANESE PATROLS NOW.
WE'LL HAVE TO SWING NORTH THROUGH HEAVY JUNGLE.
WHO'S GONNA LEAD THE WAY ?
YAI HIMSELF.
HE HATES THE JAPANESE.
THEY'VE TAKEN ALL HIS MEN FOR RAILROAD WORK,
WHICH MEANS WE SHALL HAVE TO USE WOMEN BEARERS.
WOMEN BEARERS.
THEY'RE VERY CAPABLE, I'M TOLD.
[ Speaks Siamese ]
[ Baby Fussing ]
[ Siamese Continues ]
HE SAYS IT'S DANGEROUS TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE VILLAGE.
THERE'S AN ENEMY POST ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY,
SO WE SHALL HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE JUNGLE.
WHAT ABOUT CHAPMAN, SIR ?
YAI'S PEOPLE WILL BURY HIM AND HIS CHUTE.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG ?
I WAS JUST THINKING.
YOU SPEAK YAI'S LANGUAGE.
I DON'T.
HE'S GONNA LEAD YOU BACK TO THE RIVER KWAI HIMSELF,
BY A ROUTE I NEVER TOOK.
WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHY I'M SO INDISPENSABLE TO THIS OUTFIT ?
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THE UNEXPECTED, ISN'T THERE ?
TELL THAT TO CHAPMAN.
LET'S GET CRACKING.
[ Squawking ]
[ Squealing ]

YOU'RE LOVELY.

[ Cigarette Singeing ]
[ Siamese ] SHE'S TELLING YOU TO HOLD STILL.
SHE WANTS TO TAKE THE LEECHES OFF YOUR BACK.
WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS ?
I'LL TEACH YOU TO SAY THAT IN SIAMESE, IF YOU LIKE.
NO.
THAT WOULD SPOIL IT.
TOO MUCH TALK ALWAYS SPOILS IT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT THING, JOYCE ?
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
IT'S TAKEN AN AWFUL BEATING.
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET A STRONG SIGNAL.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
IT'S WET, MILDEWED, CORRODED, ROTTEN,
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS ROTTEN JUNGLE.
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL DUMP IT.

CAN WE GET THERE IN TIME, SIR ?
YAI SAYS WE'RE TWO TO THREE DAYS' MARCH FROM THE KWAI.

YES, SIR ?
I'VE JUST SPOKEN WITH REEVES AND HUGHES,
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH THE BRIDGE ON TIME.
OH.
WE JUST HAVEN'T THE MANPOWER, THAT'S ALL.
I'VE ASKED THE OFFICERS TO LEND A HAND, BUT EVEN THAT WON'T DO IT.
THE OFFICERS ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE BRIDGE ?
I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION, AND THEY VOLUNTEERED, BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK SAITO FOR SOME OF HIS MEN ?
WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.
THIS IS OUR SHOW.
WE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF OUR OWN RESOURCES.
THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT-- THE SICK LIST.
LOOK HERE, SIR, THERE'S NOT A MAN IN THIS HOSPITAL WHO DOESN'T BELONG THERE.
DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.
NO REFLECTION ON YOU.
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS A FEW MALINGERERS.
BE HONEST.
KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.
COME ALONG.
LET'S SEE.
DON'T MOVE.
DON'T MOVE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HASKINS ?
HE'S GOT AMEBIC DYSENTERY AND BLACKWATER FEVER.
HIS TEMPERATURE WAS 104 LAST NIGHT.
RIGHT, I SEE.
AND THIS MAN ?
LEG ULCERS.
I MAY SAVE THE LEG IF I DO SOME MORE CUTTING TONIGHT.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SEND HIM OUT TO WORK, SIR ?
DON'T TALK ROT, CLIPTON.
AND THAT MAN THERE ?
HIS ARM'S INFECTED.
MOST OF THEM ARE SO RUN DOWN THEIR WOUNDS WON'T HEAL.
YES, BUT I WONDER IN A CASE LIKE HIS...
IF LIGHT DUTIES MIGHTN'T DO HIM MORE GOOD THAN BEING COOPED UP HERE.
LIGHT DUTIES ?
AFTER ALL, IT'S NOT OUR POLICY...
TO KEEP A MAN IN HOSPITAL JUST BECAUSE HE SCRATCHED HIS ARM, IS IT ?
NOT OUR POLICY ?
WELL, IS IT ?
A MAN MAY NOT BE ON TOP OF HIS FORM,
BUT HE CAN STILL MAKE HIMSELF USEFUL.

ANYTHING YOU SAY, SIR.

WHAT ABOUT YOU ?
NOTHING DIFFICULT.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING, I'M PROUD OF ALL OF YOU.
BUT WE ARE FACING A CRISIS.

OR WHETHER WE COULD FIND YOU IF WE DID.
IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES, JOYCE, I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO LEAVE YOU HERE.

YOU'D LEAVE YOUR OWN MOTHER HERE IF THE RULES CALLED FOR IT.
YOU'LL GO ON WITHOUT ME.

I WON'T OBEY THAT ORDER.
YOU MAKE ME SICK WITH YOUR HEROICS.

FOR WHAT ?
HOW TO DIE LIKE A GENTLEMAN.
HOW TO DIE BY THE RULES.
WHEN THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING IS HOW TO LIVE LIKE A HUMAN BEING !
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU HERE TO DIE, WARDEN,
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR BRIDGE...
AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR RULES.
IF WE GO ON, WE GO ON TOGETHER.

COME ON.
LET'S GET CLOSER.
STILL SORRY WE BROUGHT YOU ALONG ?
FEELING BETTER ?
YEAH.
YOU'RE IN COMMAND AGAIN NOW, YOU KNOW.
THANK YOU, MAJOR.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
IT'S SUCH A SOLID, WELL-DESIGNED JOB.
NOT LIKE THE TEMPORARY BRIDGES THE ENEMY USUALLY THROWS TOGETHER.
LOOK.
THOSE POOR DEVILS DOWN THERE.
IMAGINE BEING FORCED TO BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE CONDITION THEY MUST BE IN.
[ Joyce ] THEY'VE GOT A BRITISH OFFICER WORKING DOWN THERE ON HIS KNEES.
THEJAPANESESEEMTOBE ENJOYINGITTOO.
IF HE KNEW WE WERE HERE, IT MIGHT BOOST HIS MORALE A LITTLE.
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE TRAIN, WE COULD SET A TIME FUSE AND BE MILES AWAY.
BUT SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT'S GOING TO CROSS TOMORROW MORNING,
WE'LL HAVE TO DO THE JOB MANUALLY.
WE'LL SET THE CHARGES AGAINST THE PILES...
ABOUT THREE FEET UNDER THE WATER, I SHOULD THINK,
AND RUN THE MAIN WIRE DOWNSTREAM TO THE PLUNGER.
THE PROBLEM IS WHERE TO HIDE IT.
YEAH, OUR SIDE OF THE RIVER IS QUITE OBVIOUSLY USED BY THE JAPANESE.
THEY'D SPOT IT AT ONCE.
LOOK.
YOU SEE THOSE FALLEN TREE TRUNKS...
AND THE GRAY ROCK JUST BELOW THEM ON THAT LITTLE BEACH ?
YES, SIR, I SEE THEM.
THAT'SOURKEYPOSITION.
IT'S ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE RIVER,
BUT IT'S THE ONLY HIDING PLACE WITHIN FEASIBLE DISTANCE.
AS SOON AS THE BRIDGE GOES UP...
WHOEVER'S THERE WILL HAVE TO SWIM BACK.
IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE A PLEASANT SWIM.
SIR, I WAS THE BEST SWIMMER IN MY COURSE.
YEAH.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LINE OF COUNTRY.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SHEARS, YOU'LL HAVE TO PICK A SPOT WHERE YOU CAN COVER JOYCE.
RIGHT.
YAI WILL BE WITH YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OCCUPY THE NIPS IF THEY MAKE TROUBLE FOR JOYCE.
AND ON THE THEORY THAT THERE'S ALWAYS ONE MORE THING TO DO,
I'LL SET UP THE MORTAR HERE TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL DIVERSION IF NECESSARY.
PERHAPS I MIGHT EVEN TAKE A FEW POTSHOTS AT THE TRAIN.
ALL CLEAR ?
ANY QUESTIONS ?
RIGHT.
WE'LL START AS SOON AS IT'S DARK.
THEY'RE SURE TO HAVE SENTRIES ON THE BRIDGE,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO FLOAT THE STUFF DOWN FROM UPRIVER,
WHICH MEANS BUILDING A RAFT.
[ Speaking Siamese ]
YAI WILL TAKE THREE WOMEN TO HELP YOU BUILD THE RAFT.
ONE WILL STAY HERE WITH ME.
ALL RIGHT, NOW GET CRACKING.
SHEARS...
YOU KNOW, IF IT WASN'T FOR MY ANKLE, I'D TAKE JOYCE'S ASSIGNMENT.
I KNOW.
DO YOU THINK HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT ?
I THINK SO.
WANT ME TO HANDLE IT ?
I'D LET YOU STAY UP HERE WITH THE MORTAR IF I COULD.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.
WHEN IT'S OVER, I HOPE YOU GET THAT MEDICAL DISCHARGE, AND NOT THE HARD WAY.
THANKS.

YES, BEAUTIFUL.

TOMORROW IT WILL BE 28 YEARS TO THE DAY THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE SERVICE.
TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS IN PEACE AND WAR.
I DON'T SUPPOSE I'VE BEEN AT HOME MORE THAN TEN MONTHS IN ALL THAT TIME.
STILL, IT'S BEEN A GOOD LIFE.
I LOVE INDIA.
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT ANY OTHER WAY.
BUT THERE ARE TIMES...
WHEN SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NEARER THE END THAN THE BEGINNING.
AND YOU WONDER,
YOU ASK YOURSELF...
WHAT THE SUM TOTAL OF YOUR LIFE REPRESENTS,
WHAT DIFFERENCE YOUR BEING THERE AT ANY TIME MADE TO ANYTHING...
OR IF IT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL, REALLY.
PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER MEN'S CAREERS.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT KIND OF THINKING IS VERY HEALTHY,
BUT I MUST ADMIT I'VE HAD SOME THOUGHTS ON THOSE LINES FROM TIME TO TIME.
BUT TONIGHT, TONIGHT--

DON'T WAIT FOR THE TRAIN.
DO IT NOW !
[ManShoutsInJapanese]
IF SAITO'S INFORMATION IS CORRECT,
THE TRAIN SHOULD BE ALONG IN FIVE OR TEN MINUTES.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, SIR, I'LL WATCH THE CEREMONIES FROM UP ON THE HILL.
WHY ?
YOU'LL GET A BETTER VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE.
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, SIR, BUT I'D RATHER NOT BE A PART OF IT.
AS YOU PLEASE.
HONESTLY, CLIPTON, SOMETIMES I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL.
WELL, AS YOU ONCE SAID, SIR, I'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE ARMY.
GOOD MORNING.
RIVER'S GONE DOWN IN THE NIGHT.
[ Train Whistle Blowing ]
[ Train Whistle Continues ]
WHAT IS HE DOING ?
[ Train Chugging In Distance ]
[ Train Whistle Continues ]
COLONEL, THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER ODD GOING ON.
I THINK WE'D BETTER HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AROUND BEFORE THAT TRAIN COMES ACROSS.
[ Train Whistle Continues ]
HE'S GONE MAD.
HE'S LEADING HIM RIGHT TO IT.
OUR OWN MAN !
I WAS RIGHT.
THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON.
[ Train Approaching ]
[ Train Whistle Continues ]
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT, BOY.
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT NOW.
COL.
SAITO, HAVE YOU A KNIFE ?
I'VE JUST REALIZED THE BRIDGE HAS BEEN MINED.
MINED ?
[ Gasps ]
[ Grunts ]
GOOD BOY.
OFFICER, SIR.
BRITISH OFFICER, HERE TO BLOW UP THE BRIDGE.
BLOW UP THE BRIDGE ?
YES, SIR.
BRITISH COMMANDO ORDERS, SIR.
BLOW UP THE BRIDGE ?
LOOK OUT !
THERE'S NOT TIME.
NO !
NO !

MADNESS.
I HAD TO DO IT.
I HAD TO DO IT !
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAPTURED ALIVE !
IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO.
[ Train Smoldering ]

MADNESS.
MADNESS !
[ Men Marching ]

Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that english kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'II we be?
Before that happens we'II be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, Iet's knock off.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1 943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is NichoIson.
I am colonel Saito.
In the name of His imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'II begin.
Let me remind you of general Yamashita's motto:
" Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
battalion, stand at ease.
fall out, Major Hughes.
battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with CIipton.
CIipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an australian.
AII that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
mostly Aussies.
Some Iime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has CIipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
AII right.
You'II stay with the officers.
We'II find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a Iot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps col.
NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
But may I add another word?
please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the Iaw, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'II be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
english prisoners!
Notice I do not say english soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
AII men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, colonel Saito to article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" BeIIigerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read english, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What " Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absoIved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
AII enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
battalion, take up tools.
Move to the Ieft in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
" C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, colonel....
Two.
Stop!
colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'II say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd Iike to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I couId have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I couId have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for NichoIson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
tell him that if his officers will not work I'II be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's CIipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-killed, attempting to escape.
also two others, corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, CIipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
WouIdn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, CIipton, I understand.
truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'II be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'II stop at nothing to get his way.
principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-AII right.
please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
reynolds stole the coconut.
We'II be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
well?
It's like this.
colonel NichoIson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
should a tragedy occur, it wouId be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
battalion, attention.
english prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
AII work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
english corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London PoIytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
-I must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-I have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers beIow--
No officers will do manual labour.
please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
CIipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
please sit down.
Now.
tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
DemoraIization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-I am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
battalion, attention!
battalion, stand at ease.
please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
-I say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'II teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'II put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-There's the challenge.
-I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
tell me what you want and we'II get it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'II do out best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
incorrectly?
unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
AII the work has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
-alter?
-I've increased it.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
colonel, it wouId save time if we could work during dinner.
would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'II try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'II certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, CIipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
AII I need is love.
It's true.
AII you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'II get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you Iike it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
jolly good.
well, I'II be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is in the botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'II be grateful.
-Who?
-Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'II send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
general salute!
general salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I.
-I thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'II be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'II show you the way.
He'II finish his lecture any moment now.
I'II show you the way.
He'II finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Good of you to come.
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
well, come along, then.
col.
Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as geIignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you Iike with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
would you Iike to see where you were?
AII right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
MaIaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'II try to prevent them.
We'II try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'II have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
col.
Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
actually, col.
Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'II say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd Iike that drink now.
I'II apply for a medical discharge.
I'II say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm admiral HaIsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
really?
Good show!
jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
colonel might think I'm maIingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
hello, CIipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no Ionger abused.
honestly, CIipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'II try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, CIipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a Iot to Iearn about the army.
hold him!
hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
AII right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
exactly what did you do?
well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
could you use it in cold blood?
could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'II let you know.
You see what I mean.
well, at Ieast he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
blast!
This is awkward.
silly, it never occurred to me!
well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'II go check right away.
-AII right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'II interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'II be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'II swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'II have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'II take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'II teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'II tell you.
It's wet, miIdewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'II be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
jolly good fun.
jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
well, we'II complete this later.
-CIipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'II make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few maIingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, Iet's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, CIipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-It's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'II try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'II be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I couId have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'II bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'II go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
explosives and L-piIIs go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that colonel NichoIson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
AII right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
still sorry we brought you along?
-feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, weII-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'II cross tomorrow we'II have to do the job manually.
...we'II have to do the job manually.
We'II set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'II set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
AII clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'II start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'II have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
AII right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'II be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I couId.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it wouId turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
still, it's been a good life.
I Iove India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'II be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major CIipton and the sick men and we'II rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'II be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a Iong and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'II watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a Iot to Iearn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
help!
kill him!
kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
kill him!
kill him!
kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu... how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why...
I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him... then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something... who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1943... for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You gonna tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 16... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention... and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites...
Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito... but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape... to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I...
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you... better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war... who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914... when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness... we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel... quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
I'll be forced to close the hospital... and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations... and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
- Clipton!
- Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
- Time!
- Here.
- Here is where we must win through.
- Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question... why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure... of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided... to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you...
I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel... if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
- Major Clipton did mention that.
- Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now...
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant...
What's his name?
- Miura.
- Miura.
Is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance... who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
- Over Russia in 1905.
- Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Sir, 12, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge... how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you... the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here... where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now...
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily... and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site... and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster... we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves... 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we...
- Carry on, Hughes.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions...
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them... but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement... for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Oh, yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days... and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition... but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, sir, please?
- Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I, sir.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come.
- I hope they took care of you.
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya...
Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
- So if there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much... but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your CINC Pacific... authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward... and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer... an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
- Made.
I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer... because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am... those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing... because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your CINC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero... for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home... and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned... we're fairly informal about those things in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
- Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
- Yes, sir, but...
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
- That's all true.
- Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as... forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor... but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before... in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new I pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Caught him?
- Yes.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
- No?
- If you make one jump... you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Who's gonna lead the way?
- Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned."
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train...
Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you... but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties... might do more good than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...
- Just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Now, look here, men.
It goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it... how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
- You're gonna leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route... or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and I pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules... when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden... because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow... we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles... about three feet under the water, I should think... and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river... but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up... whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
- If they make any trouble for Joyce.
- Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing...
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge... so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver... which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge... and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 10 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times... when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy... but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines... from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us... when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow... to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion... of this link in the railway... will enable us to transport the sick and disabled... to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind... with Major Clipton and the sick men... and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year... on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again... you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here... in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness... you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1 943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
-You gonna tell him the truth?
-Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
-l'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
-Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
-Good.
-How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-l think he understands now.
-ls that so?
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
-Right.
-But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
-lnteresting?
-Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-l'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-l see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
-Clipton!
-Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
-Time!
-Here.
-Here is where we must win through.
-Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it. I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
-Major Clipton did mention that.
-Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
- What's his name?
-Miura.
-Miura.
--is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-l am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
-...over Russia in 1 905.
-Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Sir, 1 2, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes. I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-But there's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, gentlemen?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do our best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
-Carry on, Hughes.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
-We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
-Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning. I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Oh, yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
-l'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me.
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
-Mind if I have one?
-No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have a martini?
-No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
-Lord who?
-Mountbatten.
-We're one of his special pigeons.
-Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, sir, please?
-Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I, sir.
-l thought you were the enemy.
-l'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can l do for you, sir?
-l was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Very good of you to come.
-l hope they took care of you.
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape. lt was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How will you get there?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-l don't want to discourage-- -lt should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
-So if there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
-They can't do this to me.
-l'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived here at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
-Made.
I'd like that drink now.
-Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
-Where did you get this?
-lt took a bit of doing because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-l wonder what he's thinking.
-l haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
-Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
-Yes, sir, but--
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
-That's all true.
-Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry l'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-l was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new L pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal. instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-lt's Warden I don't get.
-Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Caught him?
-Yes.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
-No?
-lf you make one jump you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Who's gonna lead the way?
-Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers.
-They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-l've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
-And that man there?
-His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
-l'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Now, look here, men. lt goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it. I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
-lt's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
-You're gonna leave me here.
-lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet under the water, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
-...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
-Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 1 0 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
-You gonna tell him the truth?
-Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
-I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
-Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
-Good.
-How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
-Right.
-But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
-Interesting?
-Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
-Clipton!
-Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
-Time!
-Here.
-Here is where we must win through.
-Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
-I must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
-I have only 12 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
-Major Clipton did mention that.
-Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
- What's his name?
-Miura.
-Miura.
--is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-I am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
-...over Russia in 1905.
-Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Sir, 12, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
-I say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-But there's the challenge.
-I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, gentlemen?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do our best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
-Carry on, Hughes.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
-We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
-Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Oh, yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me.
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
-Mind if I have one?
-No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have a martini?
-No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
-Lord who?
-Mountbatten.
-We're one of his special pigeons.
-Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
-Okay, 10:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, sir, please?
-Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I, sir.
-I thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you, sir?
-I was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Very good of you to come.
-I hope they took care of you.
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How will you get there?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
-So if there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
-They can't do this to me.
-I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived here at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
-Made.
I'd like that drink now.
-Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
-Where did you get this?
-It took a bit of doing because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned we're fairly informal about those things in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-I wonder what he's thinking.
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
-Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
-Yes, sir, but--
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
-That's all true.
-Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new L pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Caught him?
-Yes.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
-No?
-lf you make one jump you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Who's gonna lead the way?
-Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers.
-They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
-And that man there?
-His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-It's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Now, look here, men.
It goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
-You're gonna leave me here.
-lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet under the water, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
-...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
-Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 10 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
" Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What " Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
" C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut-- l could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-l am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-There's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do out best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-I've increased it.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
-Who?
-Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I.
-l thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Good of you to come.
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
-If there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing-- l don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
-They can't do this!
-I'm afraid they have.
it was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
-Where did you get this?
-It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-What's he thinking?
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry l'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
ln '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new " L" pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal. lnstant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Then who's going to lead?
-Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers!
-They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
-You're going to leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
...we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking....
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge!
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
!
-Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head.
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Before that happens, we'll be far away from here, chum.
Let's knock off.
Here lies--
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried.
- Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01 234567... valiant member of the King's own... or the Queen's own or something... who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord 1 943... for the greater glory of--
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the men.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers.
Well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
- You going to tell him the truth?
- Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
- I'll have a word with this fellow.
- Very good.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
- I'll speak to Clipton.
See you later.
- Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm,Jennings?
- Nearly healed, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
- Good heavens.
- How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
They're all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers, and we'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me, Colonel.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
- What's his name?
I think he understands the situation now.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
He's seems a reasonable type.
I must be pushing on.
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
- Anything we can do.
- Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito, but "reasonable"?
That's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir.
- Yes,Jennings?
About the escape committee, sir.
I've talked with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are a hundred to one.
- Right.
- But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, Commander?
I've been biding my time, waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's normally the duty of a captured soldier... to attempt escape... but my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
"Ordered."
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir.
- Interesting point.
- I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point:
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the program.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
If they have that idea to cling to, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave.
Queer bird, even for an American.
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say, " English soldiers."
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
" Better to live like a coolie than die like a hero."
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
" Belligerents may employ as workmen... prisoners of war who are physically fit other than officers--"
- Give me the book.
- By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of precise translation, I'm sure that can be arranged.
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code, of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You'll never get away with calling it a mass escape.
- Most of those men can't walk.
- Shut up!
Is this your soldier's code, murdering unarmed men?
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man:
He's got guts.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
- How's that, sir?
- That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all!
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He didn't actually order us not to escape.
He only suggested--
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're putting him in the oven.
They're putting him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
- One, two, three, pull!
- Hurry!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness... we are far behind the schedule!
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers to direct them.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he pointed out, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
I'll be forced to close the hospital... and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
The doc's going to see the old man.
Sir?
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
They're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed attempting to escape.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'd like to clean you up while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've had a word with Saito.
That man's the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
- Blackmail.
- I know, sir, but he means it.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
- He can't give in.
- It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
And wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are going as slow on it as they dare... but Saito's cut their food rations.
If he makes the sick men work, they're going to die.
- That's all there is to it.
- Yes, I truly understand... but it's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who will stop at nothing to get his way.
" Principle"?
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
- Give in, sir, please.
- I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you a little something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
The colonel won't give in.
It's like this:
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I must protest at the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
"Why does the bridge not progress?"
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
He's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
- Cheers.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
- Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
- Time is short.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
I'm not responsible for the actions of other commanding officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'll have to kill myself.
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
- What's his name?
- Mioura.
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
Then there's demoralization and chaos.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You prove my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
- It's pointless going on like this.
- Stay there!
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
- Do you know the date today?
- I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1 905.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
- Many thanks.
- I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
- I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
It may be funny, and I'm sure it's done with the best motives... but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
- Reeves.
- Yes, sir?
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
- Why not?
- As I was trying to tell you, sir... thejapanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity;
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
It won't be easy, but we have the means at hand.
- The bridge.
- "The bridge," sir?
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
It's going to be difficult in this godforsaken place... where you can't find what you need.
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
You're not so usually slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work for them to do, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
It's essential that they should take pride in their job.
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation as engineer.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
- Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
- Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
Look, it's all here.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Then we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster... we build a new bridge at the site selected by Major Reeves... 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it... from a yard and a half of earth moved to two yards.
It's in the general interest, and I was sure you would approve.
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
I've done a time study of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
There's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half, not to overtire them... but wouldn't it be best if we made it the same as the British soldiers?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible... but we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget that we've wasted over a month... through an unfortunate disagreement, for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
I hope theseJapanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years?
- Yes, sir.
That would be something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes.
Down on the beach.
- Thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover, and I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, Commander?
Don't call me Commander.
It's unromantic.
Look, you're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you, and he's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to intrude.
That's okay, Major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
- That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?
- How did you manage to get that?
- This is a hospital, Major.
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Of course.Jolly good.
I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
- Are you sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
You know, Major, I'm leaving for the States in a few days... and I've already told your intelligence people everything I know.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you come out and see us?
If you want to go over it again, I'll come.
That's very kind of you.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- I see.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
You're terribly sorry, but you're standing me up tonight
You couldn't be more wrong.
- May I see your pass, sir?
- Yes.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the pathway, sir.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
He's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
I'm an American, if that's what you mean.
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
- Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture, sir.
- Thunderous ovation.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
- They certainly have.
- Thank you.
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Fascinating place, isn't it?
Utterly charming.
I didn't realize it was a commando school.
We're discouraging the use of that word.
It has such a melodramatic air.
- What do you do here?
- Sabotage, demolition.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- A pot of tea for one, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
They were about to shoot him, and he didn't bat an eye.
I suppose if you're about to be shot, there isn't a great deal you can do.
Here is the River Kwai...
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, thejapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load... so we shall have to go in and smash it up on the ground.
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop and then march.
- With demolition equipment?
- Yes.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage you, but--
- It should be interesting.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
- Are you sure you won't have tea?
- No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I have a luncheon date, and she's beautiful.
- So if there are any questions--
- Yes, of course.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know under the circumstances it's a bit much... but you do have a unique knowledge for our purpose... and we'd love to have you with us.
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous.
- This is embarrassing.
- I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
- With my people?
- Yes, your navy turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
They can't do this to me.
My navy's made a mistake.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
- Very sensible.
- Not that it did me any good.
At Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
I looked at the enlisted men's ward and the officers' ward... and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for awhile."
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is that you can't use me.
You want an American commander named Shears, and he doesn't exist.
When the Navy brass learns the truth about me, they'll say...
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer!"
Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
- " Made."
- I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know?
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
That's a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
When my navy finds out who I am... those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Is this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing.
Naturally, your people couldn't identify you at first.
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
We've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But they can't very well bring you home... and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over to us.
- You see?
- Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned... we're fairly informal about those things in Force 31 6.
So you'll have a simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering, sir.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
It's about time you paid a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
"A good idea"?
Let's take another look.
You don't agree the men's morale is high... that discipline has been restored... that their condition has been improved?
- Aren't they a happier lot?
- Yes, sir, but--
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
- That's all true.
- Well then?
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as... collaboration with the enemy... perhaps even as treasonable activity.
Are you all right?
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse work.
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
Don't you realize how important it is to show these people... they can't break us in body or in spirit?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
- British soldiers even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
You're a fine doctor, but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
- I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
- Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr.Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before, in a job like yours, even when it's finished... there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir, and we'll need a good swimmer.
Yes, I'm well aware of your evaluation, Chapman.
I want Shears' opinion.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
Sir, in '39, I came over to London to enlist... and about two years later, I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered?
- Yes, sir.
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
What was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself--
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
I think that's all.
Thank you,Joyce.
- Am I to go with the team, sir?
- We'll let you know.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
He's Canadian.
That's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
If you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
Now then, I've had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
- In that case, maybe--
- Yes, he's right.
We'd better arrange some practice jumps for him immediately.
I'll pop over and check with Freddy right away.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
- Feel like a sniff of air?
- Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that will interest you: the new L pill.
- " L pill"?
- L for lethal; instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
In other words, you're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of the others.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
- He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Why not?
Cambridge don and all that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers, but--
He's not without experience.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind and blew up a couple of bridges... one or two trains and I don't know how many other installations... before theJaps caught him.
- "Caught him"?
- Yes.
Fascinating story.
Sir, it's most annoying.
They say, in view of the time element... they don't think a few practice jumps would be worthwhile.
They say if you make one jump, you've only got 50% chance of injury... two jumps, 80% and three jumps, you're bound to catch a backache.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
"With or without--"
He's in the trees.
Yai says we'll never reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.
- Who's leading?
- Yai himself.
He hates thejapanese.
They've taken all his men for railroad work... which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post about three miles away... so we shall have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman, sir?
- Yai's people will bury him... and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language, I don't.
He's leading you back to the river Kwai himself... by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected.
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
Go ahead.
You're lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese, if you like.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
- What's wrong with that thing,Joyce?
- I don't know, sir.
It's taken a beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten... like everything else in this rotten jungle.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay here much longer, we'll be up to our necks.
- I have it all decoded, sir.
- Right.
Read it.
Yes, sir. "One:
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two:
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
Three:
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four:
Good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
It's worth having a go for the train, don't you think?
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
We'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I've spoken with Reeves and Hughes, and we won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help and they've agreed, but that won't do it.
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
I explained the situation, and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
- Ask Saito for some of his men.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
Sir, there's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
Let's see.
Don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
- His temperature was 1 04 last night.
- Right, I see.
- And this man?
- Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot.
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.
Most of them are so run-down, their wounds won't heal properly.
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
It's not our policy to keep a man in the hospital... just because he scratched his arm, is it?
- " Not our policy"?
- Is it?
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying, I'm proud of all of you... but we are facing a crisis.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on,Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
There's nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Shut up,Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts now.
- Yeah, but how far and how fast?
- We won't know till I try.
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
Sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route... or whether we could find you if we did.
If you were in my shoes, you know I wouldn't hesitate to leave you here.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
There's a stench of death about you.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
With you, it's just one thing or the other:
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden... because I don't care about your bridge and your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again.
Thank you, Major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working down there on his knees.
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.
But since we don't know what time it will cross tomorrow morning... we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles... about three feet under the water, I should think... and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by thejapanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river... but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up... whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
- It looks like your line of country.
- Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble forJoyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing to do...
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion if necessary.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
We'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge... so you'll have to float the stuff down... from upriver... which means building a raft.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
If it wasn't for my ankle, I'd takeJoyce's assignment.
I know.
Do you think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
- I know.
- I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge... and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I don't suppose I've been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times... when suddenly you realize you're nearer the end than the beginning.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy... but I must admit I've had some thoughts along those lines... from time to time.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say... this has been an enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of the bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know... the completion of this link in the railway... will enable us to transport the sick and the disabled... to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me... to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men... and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year... or that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again... you're going to feel very proud... of what you have achieved here... in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You're in business.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do... but I can't think of what it could be... except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now.
If Saito's information is correct... the train should be along in five or ten minutes.
If you don't mind, sir, I'll watch the ceremonies from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir, but I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we'd better have another look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
" Mined"?
" Mined"?
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
There's no time.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
You don't understand, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He gave it to me for a favor I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beri-beri in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of...
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll find some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
- What is it?
- Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd.
Shears...
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're clear on the program.
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers..."
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
What "Code"?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
They're too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
They're going to put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've tried to see you for three days.
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
The men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Doc's going to see the old man.
Sir...
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work...
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
- Time.
- All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our...
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look!
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labor.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've thought the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to work.
No.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
That won't solve your problem.
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
- Of course.
- Good.
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's-his-name...
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.
If it's gone, he ceases to command.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in 1905.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behavior.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I know how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll get it.
Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.
Let's proceed to the next point.
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
- Alter?
- I've increased it.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
I've done a time study of the entire project.
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
He's all yours.
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.
My name's Warden.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.
Like a martini?
That's very kind.
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.
- Who?
- Mountbatten.
We're one of his special pigeons.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?
- So am I.
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?
Good of you to come.
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.
We think the camp's here.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
We'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.
- If there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
Under the circumstances it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
We'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.
It was hard to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake!
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
That's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?
Made!
I'd like that drink now.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.
I'm getting worse.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
Not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
Isn't this your photograph?
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing since your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.
At the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your rank is concerned we're fairly informal about that in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.
Colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even treason.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
I've told you in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.
How did you wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself...
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, he's Canadian.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll go check right away.
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realize what a plum you are.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new "L" pill.
- L pill?
- L for lethal.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
He'll be okay.
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh?
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...
He's not without experience, you know.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
- Fascinating story.
He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80%.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking!
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you.
It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days away.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.
We haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.
The officers are working?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
We'll make the most of our resources.
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's wrong with Haskins?
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
That man there?
His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.
You?
Nothing difficult.
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.
Look here, men.
It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
- Yes, sir.
- Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You're in command again, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet underwater, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.
The wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It won't be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
I've been thinking...
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.
You'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
You're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
It's better from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it!
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
- Blow up the bridge?
!
- Yes.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
He willed it to me for a favour I'd done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him then where'll we be?
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.
Far away.
Okay, let's knock off.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord, 1943 for the greater glory of....
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.
No need to mock the grave.
I don't mock the grave or the man.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
"A" Company, mark time!
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
We're gonna be a busy pair of gravediggers, Weaver.
Well done, well done.
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.
-You gonna tell him the truth?
-Of course not.
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:
"Be happy in your work."
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.
I'm gonna have a word with this fellow.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
-I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
-Very good, sir.
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
-Good.
-How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
You'll stay with the officers.
We'll scrape up some decent clothing.
Don't bother about me.
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
I raised that very point with Colonel what's-his-name.
Saito.
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
There's an officer's meeting at 7.
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
-What is it?
-Never mind.
Go on, say it.
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito but reasonable, that's a new one.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
-By your leave, sir?
-Yes, Jennings?
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears--
There won't be any escape committee.
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one.
-Right.
-But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?
I'm biding my time.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
-Interesting?
-Yes, sir, interesting point.
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I think we're all clear on the programme.
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
As for me, I'm just a slave.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war who are fit, other than officers--"
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
The coward's code!
What do you know of the soldier's code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
"C" Company, by the right.
What's he up to?
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
He's going to do it.
Believe me, he's really going to do it.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.
"Into the valley of death rode the 600."
How's that, sir?
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.
What about him?
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
They're gonna put him in the oven.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I've been trying to see you for three days.
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers.
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
He's mad, your colonel quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work I'll be forced to close the hospital and your patients will work in their place.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Hey, the doc's going to see the old man.
Sir....
It's Clipton, sir.
I brought you a few things.
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?
Look, sir, we haven't much time.
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.
I've got something to tell you.
I've just had a word with Saito.
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.
It's still blackmail.
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.
But Saito's cut their food rations and if he makes the sick men work....
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it.
No.
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.
We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I'm adamant.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
-Time.
-All right.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
We'll be able to get you something from time to time.
We've bribed one of your guards.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
-Clipton!
-Yes, sir?
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
It's insane to plan escapes.
Three men killed, and to what end?
-Time!
-Here.
-Here is where we must win through.
-Time, time!
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Means only one thing, colonel won't give in.
Well?
It's like this.
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.
It's a question of principle.
As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
It's a wonder he's still alive.
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
He's given us our--
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.
"Tomorrow we begin again."
Hey, Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
-I must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
-I have only 12 weeks more.
-No doubt.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
I'm not responsible for the actions of other officers.
Personally, I'm appalled.
Let's not get excited.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
I've been thinking the matter over and have decided to put majors and above on administrative duties leaving only junior officers to lend a hand.
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's quite clear on that point.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
I haven't the foggiest.
I'd have to kill myself.
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you I'd have to kill myself.
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
-Major Clipton did mention that.
-Well?
That won't solve your problem.
But I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
-Of course.
-Good.
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
It's quite an enormous undertaking.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
- What's his name?
-Miura.
-Miura.
--is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
It's essential for an officer to have that respect, I'm sure you agree.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
-I am not!
-You've proved my point.
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
I'm afraid I've lost count.
It's the anniversary of our great victory...
-...over Russia in 1905.
-Oh, yes.
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
He's done it!
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
Well, I don't really know, sir.
-You don't know?
-Sir, 12, usually.
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
- He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
-I say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't build it here.
Oh, why not?
As I was trying to tell you the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.
There's no bottom.
You see those piles?
They're sinking.
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
There's no order, no discipline.
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.
Which isn't going to be easy.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that will put them to shame.
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
I realise how difficult it's going to be here where you can't find what you need.
-But there's the challenge.
-I beg your pardon, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.
Fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.
But it's going to be a proper bridge.
Here again I know the men.
It's essential that they take pride in their job.
-Right, gentlemen?
-Yes, sir.
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer.
Tell me what you want and we'll organise it.
Can we make a go of it?
-We'll do our best, sir.
-Fine.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
Then I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves 400 yards downstream.
So let's proceed to the next point.
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.
-Alter?
-Yes, I've increased it.
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito, of the entire project.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
-Carry on, Hughes.
-Yes, sir.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them but isn't it best to be the same as ours?
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
-We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
-Yes, sir.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.
But we'll certainly give it a go.
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame.
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.
-Oh, yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
It's true.
All you really need is love.
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How's that, commander?
Don't call me commander.
It's unromantic.
You're an officer yourself.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
He's all yours.
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me.
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.
My name's Warden.
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.
Like a martini?
That's very kind, but I think not.
-Mind if I have one?
-No.
How did you get that?
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.
-Sure you won't have a martini?
-No, thanks.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days and I've already told your people everything I know.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
I know it's a terrible imposition but I wonder if you could possibly come out and see us.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
-Lord who?
-Mountbatten.
-We're one of his special pigeons.
-Oh, I see.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
I'll send a car for you.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
-Okay, 10:00.
-Thanks very much.
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.
You couldn't be more wrong.
General salute!
Present arms!
-May I see your pass, sir, please?
-Oh, yes.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see, he's gained the initiative.
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
-You're sorry?
-So am I, sir.
-I thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
-What can I do for you, sir?
-I was on my way to see Major Warden.
I'll show you the way.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?
Very good of you to come.
-I hope they took care of you.
-They certainly have.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Utterly charming.
Didn't realise it was a commando school.
We're trying to discourage the use of that word.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight.
Here.
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.
Thanks for telling me.
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.
-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.
-A drink?
-No, thank you.
-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
If your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load.
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.
-How will you get there?
-Parachute drop, then march.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
-I don't want to discourage--
-It should be interesting.
Colonel Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm gonna take a team in and blow it up.
Lucky you.
Sure you won't have tea?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be rude, but I've got a luncheon date at 2.
-So if there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
And we'd love to have you with us.
That's why you brought me here?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I can't go back!
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
-They can't do this to me.
-I'm afraid they have.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it.
My Navy's made a mistake.
Look.
I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.
The whole thing's a fake.
I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
That's very sensible.
But at Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.
Yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived here at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, "Let's let it ride along for a while."
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Anyway, that's the whole story.
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer an American commander named Shears who doesn't exist.
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:
"Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer."
-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?
-Made.
I'd like that drink now.
-Of course.
I'll apply for a medical discharge.
I'll tell them I impersonated an officer because I went off my rocker in the jungle.
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.
It's quite a clever plan.
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.
If my Navy finds out who I am those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.
This is your photograph, isn't it?
-Where did you get this?
-It took a bit of doing because your people couldn't identify you.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Your Navy's in an awkward position.
In one sense you're a blasted hero for making an escape from the jungle.
But at the same time, they can't bring you home and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.
I suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us.
You see?
Hot potato.
As far as your present rank is concerned we're fairly informal about those things in Force 316.
You'd have the simulated rank of major.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.
The colonel might think I'm malingering.
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
How's he behaving?
He's been most reasonable since we took over.
-I wonder what he's thinking.
-I haven't the foggiest.
-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.
What do you think?
Quite a challenge, isn't it?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.
A good idea?
Take another look.
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
-Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
-Yes, sir, but--
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
-That's all true.
-Well, then.
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?
It's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit.
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor but you've a lot to learn about the army.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
-Sir?
-I was referring to the nurse.
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
As I've told you before in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir.
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you happen to wind up here?
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
They don't expect you to think.
Think about this.
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
I know how to use it, sir.
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir.
It's worried me quite a bit.
And what was the answer?
I don't honestly know, sir.
I've tried to imagine myself....
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.
It's an old army problem.
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
We'll let you know.
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
What's your opinion, Shears?
Well, sir, he's Canadian.
And that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.
-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
I'll pop over and check right away.
-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.
By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
The new L pill.
-L pill?
-L for lethal.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
You're telling me not to be taken alive.
I wouldn't recommend it.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I didn't want to speak out in front of them.
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
He'll be okay.
-It's Warden I don't get.
-Oh, why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--
He's not without experience, you know.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
-Caught him?
-Yes.
-Fascinating story.
He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile.
-No?
-lf you make one jump you've only got 50 percent chance of injury.
Two jumps, 80 percent.
Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
He's in the trees!
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai by the route you took.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.
-Who's gonna lead the way?
-Yai himself.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
-Women bearers.
-They're very capable, I'm told.
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.
-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language.
I don't.
He's gonna lead you back to the river by a route I never took.
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Tell that to Chapman.
Let's get cracking.
You're lovely.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
What's wrong with that thing?
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.
-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it.
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
Have fun." That's all, sir.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
It's worth it for the train.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
Well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.
Well, we'll complete this later.
-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.
We just haven't the manpower.
I've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it.
The officers are going to work?
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The sick list.
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along, let's see.
Don't move, don't move.
What's the matter with Haskins?
He's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
Don't talk rot, Clipton.
-And that man there?
-His arm's infected.
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
-Light duties?
-It's not our policy to keep a man...
-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.
Now, look here, men.
It goes without saying I'm proud of all of you.
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
-Yes, sir.
-Good show.
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Make sure they're all dead.
Come on, Joyce.
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Let's go.
It's superficial.
Maybe a chipped bone, but there's nothing broken.
-It's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up, Joyce.
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?
What are you doing?
I didn't give orders for a halt.
We all need it.
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.
Maybe six.
Come on.
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.
Yeah.
-You're gonna leave me here.
-lf you stop, we stop.
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.
You've got to get there before sundown.
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.
He doesn't know it, but I do.
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.
You're in command now, Shears.
I won't obey that order.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
I'm all right.
Come on.
Let's get closer.
Still sorry we brought you along?
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.
You're in command again now, you know.
Thank you, major.
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
They've got a British officer working on his knees.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow we'll have to do the job manually.
We'll set the charges against the piles about three feet under the water, I should think and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
They'd spot it at once.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
-Yes, sir, I see them.
-That's our key position.
It's on the wrong side of the river but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.
As soon as the bridge goes up whoever's there will have to swim back.
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
-...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
-Right.
On the theory that there's always one more thing I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver which means building a raft.
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.
I know.
You think he'll be all right?
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.
I'm sorry.
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge and not the hard way.
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
I've been thinking.
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I haven't been at home more than 10 months in all that time.
Still, it's been a good life.
I love India.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.
I don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge.
However, you'll be glad to know that the completion of this link in the railway will enable us to transport the sick and disabled to the new camp by train.
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
That's quite understandable.
It's a very natural reaction.
But one day, in a week, a month, a year on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
And you're in business.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
I'll be directly across the river.
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.
I can't think of what it could be.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
What's happened?
The river's gone down.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Don't wait for the train.
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.
Why?
You'll get a better view from the bridge.
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.
As you please.
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
Well, as you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
River's gone down in the night.
What's he doing?
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
He's gone mad.
He's leading him right to it.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.
Colonel, have you a knife?
I've just realised the bridge has been mined.
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
British commando orders.
-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir.
There's no time!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Oh, good evening.
I guess if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.
The plumber keeps fixing the leak, and I don't want it fixed.
I'm sure many of you have one of these in your homes.
But for the benefit of the backward, I shall explain.
The subject is strapped in this chair.
I then turn this valve, and the water drips on his head.
One drop each minute.
After about a week of this, I suddenly turn the water off.
It produces the most astounding effects.
It is especially valuable if you have a friend who wishes to lose his inhibitions.
Naturally, you may lose your friend too.
However, there is one serious danger.
Don't ever leave it running when there is no one in the chair.
Because in a few days, the force of the dripping water can actually drill a hole through the wood.
Now, while I go back to the shop to get the proper tools, we shall have the rest of this evening's entertainment.
A honeymoon can't last forever.
But some people expect it to.
Is this a conspiracy, Myra, or may I have a light?
We were just talking about Ann Warren and her husband.
What's the matter?
Trouble in paradise?
So I hear.
Well, she doesn't exactly look like the happy young bride.
Thanks.
Hello, Ann.
Margot, are those women talking about me?
Those women are talking about everybody.
It's the only form of communication we have.
You'll adjust to it.
I suppose so.
Would you like a cigarette?
Margot, how do you balance a bankbook?
Oh, that's simple, you just doctor the books, cheat on the budget and steal from yourself.
I'll have to try it.
I was going to call you this afternoon, Ann.
We'd like you and Joe to come for dinner.
Friday night, if it's convenient.
We haven't been going out much.
I'll have to talk to Joe about it.
I'll phone you.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Beat?
To a pulp.
Then I'll save the dire news till you've had you're drink.
Anything wrong?
Oh, no.
Not really.
Something sprang a leak in the basement.
I don't know.
It's got something to do with the water heater.
Hmm.
So, I was all ready to be intrepid and put my finger in the dike, but I couldn't see where it was coming from.
I'll have a look at it before dinner.
Oh, by the way, I asked the Warrens over for dinner.
Not tonight?
Oh, no.
Friday.
Ann's got problems.
I invited them on the spur of the moment.
Her biggest problem is Joe Warren.
What's the trouble?
How should I know?
He's just a jealous, suspicious guy.
Well, you saw him last weekend at the Country Club.
He just sat and glowered all evening.
Well, I've already invited them, I hope you don't mind?
I guess not.
But it doesn't sound like a very stimulating evening.
We're certainly over-stimulated by the frantic life we lead out here.
I thought you liked living out here.
I do.
But you must admit there isn't much excitement.
I mean, when the big event of my day is a leak in the basement?
What you need is a good knife murder, or one of those juvenile gang wars.
Oh, shut up.
Did you get it fixed?
No.
It's too dark down there to see what's wrong.
I guess you'll have to call a plumber.
First thing in the morning.
Come on.
Get washed up.
Dinner's ready.
Oh, and honey?
Make sure you get an estimate before you let him do any work.
Yes, dear.
If he says it's gonna be more than $10 you can just tell him to forget it.
Oh, well, shouldn't I bargain with him?
I had such good luck with the butcher.
Yeah, well it's the milkman I've got my eye on.
Oh darling, I didn't know you were the jealous type.
Well, I wouldn't be too sure.
I'm hungry.
Mrs. Brenner?
Yes?
You phoned me up about a leak?
Oh.
You're very prompt.
Come in.
Thanks.
Would you make a note of the time?
I work by the hour.
I wouldn't want my customers to think I'm overcharging.
Oh, it's just 9:30.
Say, this is a nice place you got here.
I like the way you got it fixed up.
Thanks.
I'll bet you did it all yourself.
Well, yes, most of it.
Now, this is what really interests me.
The kitchen.
Not like most men, huh?
No, I suppose not.
Oh, well, it's different with me, you see, being a plumber.
I kind of make it my business to know just what appeals to women.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
You know something?
I can take a look at a kitchen and give you a pretty fair estimate of that person's income.
Would you believe that?
No.
Not really.
You wouldn't, huh?
Okay, I'll prove it to you.
I'd say your husband makes about...
Oh, about 19, 20,000 a year.
I came pretty close, didn't I?
You know that Rhoda Forbes that lives down the block?
Yes.
I know Mrs. Forbes.
Yeah, well, I did some work for Mrs. Forbes last winter, and I guessed her husband's income right on the nose.
Well, I...
I guess I better take a look at that leak.
Yes, it's right down there, behind the furnace.
I'll take care of it.
Do you know where the turn-off valve is?
No, but it's down there someplace.
I'll find it.
Oh, say, my husband said to get an estimate before you do the work.
Anything you say, Mrs. Brenner.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Rhoda.
Yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
You're not finished already?
Oh, no, no.
I've...
I'm just waiting for the pipe to drain.
It takes a couple of minutes, you know.
I've got to turn the valve off in the bathroom.
Now, where is that?
Upstairs?
Oh, yes.
Why do you have to go upstairs to fix the leak in the basement?
You've got to equalize the pressure or else you'll flood the whole cellar.
That's the trouble with a Stetson valve.
Otherwise they're very good.
Say, Rhoda, will you call me back again in a few minutes?
No, just a domestic crisis.
Yeah, thanks.
The bathroom is over there.
Hey, you painted this.
Margot Brenner.
That's you, ain't it?
Yes, last summer.
Up in Maine.
Well, what do you know.
A real artist.
I never met a celebrity before.
Don't be ridiculous, it's very amateurish.
No.
No, it's not.
You got real talent.
Listen, I never had much education before, but I got an artistic side.
I know something good when I see it.
I got real appreciation.
Most people have appreciation, but they're untrained.
They don't really see things.
That's absolutely true.
You know, people go through life with their eyes closed.
Not me.
You'd be surprised at some of the things I see.
You take this room for instance.
I can tell you got good taste.
You take those drapes, take this furniture, take that bedspread.
How much you pay for a spread like this?
Please.
I wish you'd get on with your work.
Sure.
I know I talk too much.
That's what everybody tells me.
But I don't mean no harm.
I'm just trying to be a little friendly.
Now the world would be a better place, wouldn't it, if everybody was just a little more friendly.
You know, "love thy neighbor"?
That's the way I am.
That's nice.
Got a lot of style.
Just like you.
Put it down.
Okay, okay, okay.
Nice and silky.
You look scared, Mrs. Brenner.
If it's on account of me, I want to apologize.
I don't mean no harm.
I just got natural curiosity, that's all.
You know, it takes curiosity to be a good plumber.
Well,
I guess I'd better get on with my trade, huh?
Mrs. Brenner.
I'm going down to the basement.
Now I ought to be able to give you an estimate in a couple of minutes.
I think I found out where the trouble is.
Ought to be real easy to fix.
How much is it going to cost?
Yes, sir, this is a mighty fine kitchen.
Not many people would be able to afford a house like this.
$500.
What?
$500.
That's what I figure the job is worth.
Now wait a minute.
I've had just about enough of this.
You wouldn't want people to hear about it, would you?
Hear about what?
About us.
Being upstairs together.
People would wonder how I knew about that painting you did in Maine, and about the bedspread, and the pink negligee.
Why, they wouldn't believe a word you said.
Wouldn't they?
How about the neighbors?
My truck's been parked in front of the house since 9:30.
What time is it now?
It's just 11:20.
I've been here for nearly two hours giving you an estimate on a leaky valve.
You and me, all alone, Mrs. Brenner.
And you too busy to even answer the phone.
Why, it never rang.
Maybe you didn't hear it.
I wonder what Mrs. Forbes thought when she called you back and she didn't get any answer.
And doesn't your husband ever phone you from the office?
Why this is blackmail.
I'll report you to the police.
Yeah, that's what Myra Herbert said.
But she didn't do it.
Myra?
Neither did Ann Warren.
Ann Warren?
You blackmailed Ann Warren?
Why, she's only been married a few months.
Yeah, I know.
And they tell me her husband is kind of jealous, too.
I won't give you a cent.
And if you make any talk about me, I'll tell my husband.
He's a lawyer and he'll take you...
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
Because you're going to need a lawyer if I decide to sue you.
Sue me?
For damages.
On account of I hurt my back when I slipped and fell in that bathroom of yours, upstairs.
Why, you wouldn't dare.
If I'm asked, I'll just have to describe that bedspread and the negligee and all, just to prove my case.
You ask your husband about the legal points.
You see even if I lose, you won't win.
Unless you're husband's a really broad-minded guy.
I don't have $500.
Sure.
I know.
But you can get it.
And don't give me any song about your husband handling all the money.
You see, I know all the angles to this game.
I do it a couple of times a month.
I average close to 15 grand a year.
Tax free.
Then you ought to realize I don't have $500 in the house.
Yeah.
I know.
But I'll be back tomorrow morning, bright and early to fix that leak.
And, that'll give you plenty of time to get to the bank.
See you, Mrs. Brenner.
Lewis, breakfast in five minutes.
Just going to have my shower.
Oh, get me the police department please.
Hello, this is Mrs. Lois Brenner, 173 Syosset Road.
Yes.
I would like to have an officer come over in about an hour.
I'm in trouble.
I'm being blackmailed.
Yes.
Thank you.
Are you absolutely sure?
I'm positive.
Jack Staley?
Why thank you.
I didn't think he went in for that kind of stuff.
Well, he does.
You'll see.
When he comes, let him in and try to act as natural as you can.
Have you got the money for it?
Yes, right here.
Let me have it.
I'll mark it so I can prove he got it from you.
Good morning, Mrs. Brenner.
I'll have that leak fixed in no time.
Just a minute.
Here.
What's that?
The money.
I've decided to pay you even though it is blackmail.
I don't want any trouble.
I don't understand you, Mrs. Brenner.
You wanted $500.
Here it is.
Look, if you're worried about yesterday, forget it.
We all make mistakes.
Why don't you pretend it never happened?
That's not the way you talked yesterday.
Oh, you mean about my back?
Oh, no, I only wrenched it a little.
It was a bit sore when I got up this morning but it'll be all right in a day or two.
If there is a big medical bill, you've probably got insurance to cover it.
But I couldn't take any money from you.
I'd feel funny about it.
You're twisting everything around.
Look, why don't I just finish the job and get out, huh?
Hello, Staley.
Mrs. Brenner, what are you trying to do to me?
She tells us that you tried to extort $500 from her.
What's your story, Staley?
Nothing.
It's...
It's just between the lady and me.
Why, he's lying, he's distorting everything.
All right, Mrs. Brenner.
How about it, Staley?
Look, Sarge, why don't you leave the lady alone?
She didn't mean any harm.
I'm ready to forget the whole thing.
That's up to Mrs. Brenner.
She made the accusation.
Your husband's a lawyer, isn't he, Mrs. Brenner?
Why don't you phone him and see what he wants to do?
I don't want him to...
No, I can't.
You believe his lies, don't you?
It doesn't matter what I believe.
You say one thing, he says another.
If you want to make a charge, I'll take him in.
No.
Okay.
On your way, Staley.
He was lying.
He knew that you were here...
The coffee cups.
He saw that there were two of them.
It's possible.
Mrs. Brenner, you haven't lived in North Park very long, have you?
No, but...
Staley was born here.
Everybody knows him.
It'd be your word against his.
But I'm not the only one he's tried this on.
He's boasted about the women he's blackmailed.
He's even told me who some of them were.
We've never had any complaints about him before.
Because they were afraid to complain.
He'd ruin their reputations.
Look, isn't there something you can do?
Not without some evidence.
If I were you, Mrs. Brenner, I'd have a talk with these other women.
If enough of you got together, you could make a case against him.
Providing it's true.
But it is true.
Okay.
That's the best advice I can give you.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brenner.
Mrs. Brenner?
Yes?
That was a dirty trick you tried to pull before.
I thought you had better sense.
I saw that one coming from way back.
You really got yourself into trouble now.
If I have to go into court, that cop will tell everything he heard today.
And you won't stand a chance.
I know that.
Okay then, I'll be around for the money later this afternoon.
Mrs. Brenner?
Do you hear me, Mrs. Brenner?
Yes.
I'll have the money ready.
Okay.
And no more tricks.
Or else I might have to raise the price on you.
Come in.
Thanks.
And this time if you don't mind, I'll take a little look around.
You'd be surprised at some of the tricks they've tried.
I didn't know you had company, Mrs. Brenner.
I'd better come back some other time.
Oh, that's quite all right, Mr. Staley.
I think you know most of these ladies.
Yes, indeed.
Nice to see you again.
Hello.
Would you like a sandwich?
Or perhaps some tea?
No, nothing.
Nothing?
Oh, surely you want your $500.
That's why you came.
Oh, don't be embarrassed, Mr. Staley.
All these ladies know about it.
Some of them have even paid you.
Okay.
Okay, Mrs. Brenner.
You have everybody here.
Are you all present?
Now what?
What are you going to do?
I'd just like to know.
Sergeant Thompson?
Oh, this is Mrs. Lois Brenner.
Yes, I took your advice.
I have all the ladies here and I...
Oh, just a moment, Sergeant.
Did you want to speak to the Sergeant?
Okay, okay.
You win.
I'll call you back later, Sergeant.
I knew it couldn't last forever.
Oh, just a minute, Staley.
We're not finished with you yet.
No.
We want our money back.
Are you kidding?
I don't have your money.
I spent it all.
Well, then you'll just have to work it out.
What?
Yes, you're a plumber.
We all have some repairs we need.
Yes, we need a new sprinkler system.
Of course, you'll have to dig up the old one first.
Very good, Myra.
We have a heater to install.
What do you need, Ann?
Oh, I have a lot of jobs.
Over $300 worth.
Nothing doing.
I wouldn't have any time for myself.
Listen, I got to live too, you know.
Why?
You can't make me do it.
That's just plain...
Blackmail?
Oh well, perhaps you'd like to call the police?
I'll dial them for you.
No, wait a minute.
Okay, I'll...
I'll do anything you want.
We thought you would.
Now we have to decide on the order.
Shall it be alphabetical or should we do it in amount already paid?
Alphabetical.
My name is Adams.
Hi.
Hello, darling, all in?
As always.
How about you?
Another exciting day in suburbia?
I had some of the girls over this afternoon.
We had tea.
Tea?
That's nice.
What else?
Oh, the plumber came to fix the leak in the basement.
Oh, honey, did you get that estimate?
Stop worrying, darling.
It was such a small job, he wouldn't take a cent.
A thief and blackmailer posing as a plumber.
Nothing is sacred anymore.
I shall be back in a moment after you've viewed this rusty elbow in the plumbing of television.
That is all for tonight.
Next week, we shall be back with another story.
I've fixed this.
Nothing to it, really.
Good night.
Oh, good evening.
I guess if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.
The plumber keeps fixing the leak, and I don't want it fixed.
I'm sure many of you have one of these in your homes.
But for the benefit of the backward, I shall explain.
The subject is strapped in this chair.
I then turn this valve, and the water drips on his head.
One drop each minute.
After about a week of this, I suddenly turn the water off.
It produces the most astounding effects.
It is especially valuable if you have a friend who wishes to lose his inhibitions.
Naturally, you may lose your friend too.
However, there is one serious danger.
Don't ever leave it running when there is no one in the chair.
Because in a few days, the force of the dripping water can actually drill a hole through the wood.
Now, while I go back to the shop to get the proper tools, we shall have the rest of this evening's entertainment.
A honeymoon can't last forever.
But some people expect it to.
Is this a conspiracy, Myra, or may I have a light?
We were just talking about Ann Warren and her husband.
What's the matter?
Trouble in paradise?
So I hear.
Well, she doesn't exactly look like the happy young bride.
Thanks.
Hello, Ann.
Margot, are those women talking about me?
Those women are talking about everybody.
It's the only form of communication we have.
You'll adjust to it.
I suppose so.
Would you like a cigarette?
Margot, how do you balance a bankbook?
Oh, that's simple, you just doctor the books, cheat on the budget and steal from yourself.
I'll have to try it.
I was going to call you this afternoon, Ann.
We'd like you and Joe to come for dinner.
Friday night, if it's convenient.
We haven't been going out much.
I'll have to talk to Joe about it.
I'll phone you.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Beat?
To a pulp.
Then I'll save the dire news till you've had you're drink.
Anything wrong?
Oh, no.
Not really.
Something sprang a leak in the basement.
I don't know.
It's got something to do with the water heater.
Hmm.
So, I was all ready to be intrepid and put my finger in the dike, but I couldn't see where it was coming from.
I'll have a look at it before dinner.
Oh, by the way, I asked the Warrens over for dinner.
Not tonight?
Oh, no.
Friday.
Ann's got problems.
I invited them on the spur of the moment.
Her biggest problem is Joe Warren.
What's the trouble?
How should I know?
He's just a jealous, suspicious guy.
Well, you saw him last weekend at the Country Club.
He just sat and glowered all evening.
Well, I've already invited them, I hope you don't mind?
I guess not.
But it doesn't sound like a very stimulating evening.
We're certainly over-stimulated by the frantic life we lead out here.
I thought you liked living out here.
I do.
But you must admit there isn't much excitement.
I mean, when the big event of my day is a leak in the basement?

I don't want him to...
No, I can't.
You believe his lies, don't you?
It doesn't matter what I believe.
You say one thing, he says another.
If you want to make a charge, I'll take him in.
No.
Okay.
On your way, Staley.
He was lying.
He knew that you were here...
The coffee cups.
He saw that there were two of them.
It's possible.
Mrs. Brenner, you haven't lived in North Park very long, have you?
No, but...
Staley was born here.
Everybody knows him.
It'd be your word against his.
But I'm not the only one he's tried this on.
He's boasted about the women he's blackmailed.
He's even told me who some of them were.
We've never had any complaints about him before.
Because they were afraid to complain.
He'd ruin their reputations.
Look, isn't there something you can do?
Not without some evidence.
If I were you, Mrs. Brenner, I'd have a talk with these other women.
If enough of you got together, you could make a case against him.
Providing it's true.
But it is true.
Okay.
That's the best advice I can give you.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brenner.
Mrs. Brenner?
Yes?
That was a dirty trick you tried to pull before.
I thought you had better sense.
I saw that one coming from way back.
You really got yourself into trouble now.
If I have to go into court, that cop will tell everything he heard today.
And you won't stand a chance.
I know that.
Okay then, I'll be around for the money later this afternoon.
Mrs. Brenner?
Do you hear me, Mrs. Brenner?
Yes.
I'll have the money ready.
Okay.
And no more tricks.
Or else I might have to raise the price on you.
Come in.
Thanks.
And this time if you don't mind, I'll take a little look around.
You'd be surprised at some of the tricks they've tried.
I didn't know you had company, Mrs. Brenner.
I'd better come back some other time.
Oh, that's quite all right, Mr. Staley.
I think you know most of these ladies.
Yes, indeed.
Nice to see you again.
Hello.
Would you like a sandwich?
Or perhaps some tea?
No, nothing.
Nothing?
Oh, surely you want your $500.
That's why you came.
Oh, don't be embarrassed, Mr. Staley.
All these ladies know about it.
Some of them have even paid you.
Okay.
Okay, Mrs. Brenner.
You have everybody here.
Are you all present?
Now what?
What are you going to do?
I'd just like to know.
Sergeant Thompson?
Oh, this is Mrs. Lois Brenner.
Yes, I took your advice.
I have all the ladies here and I...
Oh, just a moment, Sergeant.
Did you want to speak to the Sergeant?
Okay, okay.
You win.
I'll call you back later, Sergeant.
I knew it couldn't last forever.
Oh, just a minute, Staley.
We're not finished with you yet.
No.
We want our money back.
Are you kidding?
I don't have your money.
I spent it all.
Well, then you'll just have to work it out.
What?
Yes, you're a plumber.
We all have some repairs we need.
Yes, we need a new sprinkler system.
Of course, you'll have to dig up the old one first.
Very good, Myra.
We have a heater to install.
What do you need, Ann?
Oh, I have a lot of jobs.
Over $300 worth.
Nothing doing.
I wouldn't have any time for myself.
Listen, I got to live too, you know.
Why?
You can't make me do it.
That's just plain...
Blackmail?
Oh well, perhaps you'd like to call the police?
I'll dial them for you.
No, wait a minute.
Okay, I'll...
I'll do anything you want.
We thought you would.
Now we have to decide on the order.
Shall it be alphabetical or should we do it in amount already paid?
Alphabetical.
My name is Adams.
Hi.
Hello, darling, all in?
As always.
How about you?
Another exciting day in suburbia?
I had some of the girls over this afternoon.
We had tea.
Tea?
That's nice.
What else?
Oh, the plumber came to fix the leak in the basement.
Oh, honey, did you get that estimate?
Stop worrying, darling.
It was such a small job, he wouldn't take a cent.
A thief and blackmailer posing as a plumber.
Nothing is sacred anymore.
I shall be back in a moment after you've viewed this rusty elbow in the plumbing of television.
That is all for tonight.
Next week, we shall be back with another story.
I've fixed this.
Nothing to it, really.
Good night.

Times are tough.
So most people are working hard to get along.
Young men are, trying to do well on their jobs.
Thinking of their families.
Of getting ahead so they can buy a house.
And then a little car to go driving on Sundays.
Here is another sort of city, but only of men.
Many of them still in their twenties.
They work because they have to.
But society hopes the will continue to work after their release.
Sometimes society succeeds...
Sometimes it fails tragically.
The prison authorizes and parole board were confident they had succeeded
Lester N Gillis.
Soon to be better know as...
Hi Les.
Long time, no see.
Get in.
- Who told you I was getting out?
- What's the difference.
You need a ride into town don't you.
Get in.
Come on.
Hop in.
I asked you.
Who told you I was getting out?
The guy who got you out.
Guy who got me...
I got myself out by being a good boy.
- Must have took some doing.
- It did, it did.
Who's the joker taking the bows for getting me parole?
- Rocca.
- Rocca?
Is he still alive?
Why?
You can ask him when you see him.
I'm only going to see the parole officer and him because I have to.
That cheap suit and sawbuck they gave you ain't gonna last long.
You're gonna need money.
If I need money, don't worry about me kid, I'll get it.
The parole officer will want you to get a job.
- I'll get one.
- You have one.
With Rocca.
Hello shrimp.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Simmer down little man.
You ain't going nowhere.
That's a hundred I owe you Matt.
I'll pay you later.
Well, how does it feel to be outside for a change?
If I'm not interrupting your game, Mr. Rocca, maybe I could find out.
You ain't talking to a screw now.
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be inside for quite a stretch.
Don't forget that.
I've got a big investment in you.
I've got a big job for you little man.
If it's a big job.
why get a little man?
Maybe I don't know any big men I can trust.
Come on.
I'll show you.
You're wound up like a watch.
We've got to do something about that.
Tell me...
Do they let you read the newspapers up there?
- Sure.
When they serve breakfast to us in bed.
They sure must have rousted you around shrimp.
You don't like my size, let me off and I'll buy a pair of elevator shoes.
You talk like you're a kid.
You're OK or you wouldn't be here.
Hey, take a look up ahead.
Guys out of work all over the country.
Kids going hungry.
And those bums beat them up if they try to make a buck.
Is that where you make your slot machines or you've got a still in there?
No.
I'm branching out.
You've got to.
Soon they'll be selling booze in delicatessens.
Won't need prescriptions.
So I found me a new gravy train.
Somebody's got to be civic minded.
Guys who don't want to work ain't good citizens.
I ain't a particular good citizen.
Nobody's asking you, kid.
Give the tall guy with no hat a good look so you won't forget him.
The one with the glasses.
That's Steve Guarari
- He's an organizer.
- So?
So you start him organizing.
Guys in that racket don't listen good.
They've been worked on by cops, I hear.
Cops don't talk loud enough.
- We must have met different cops.
- I guess so.
The ones I know are on my payroll.
How loud do I have to talk?
One or two words ought to do it.
And for saying them, you get a grand.
He lives there.
Comes home about six for dinner.
About 7:30 goes down to union HQ.
Bunch of his boys hanging around there so... this is the best place.
Here.
You're not my man?
I don't knock off any poor slob whose been slapped around by the cops.
- That's a funny reason.
- I'm a funny guy.
Maybe I should have left you in the can.
I could put you back again.
But...
I ain't going to.
You know why?
Because you're a funny guy with funny reasons.
I find something else for you to do.
I know some cops need talking to.
It's kind of rich for my blood ain't it?
Say my name in this hotel, they'll give you a ring.
Gerry'll be in touch with you.
Keep your nose clean.
Solly.
See nobody gets their fingers caught in the cash register.
Sue... is this guy OK?
Reach back and buzz that buzzer.
There's a fellow ask... oops.
No wonder you weren't hearing good.
OK.
Go on in Jim.
Haven't they knocked over that speak yet?
Every couple of weeks.
Hey, this is no good.
Let's get out of here.
I'm the only one around tonight who can pass them through.
- I'll be off in... three hours.
- Three?
You know how long three hours is to me?
Longer than it is to me.
- Your place?
- I've got a room mate.
Ophelia.
306, The Stirling.
Don't bother to knock.
I won't be asleep.
Somebody did the job.
Skip it.
Three hours.
I thought I told you not to knock.
- Get out of bed.
- Wait men.
- He's clean.
- What d'you mean I'm clean?
Hey come on.
What are you guys after here?
What are you doing?
Put that rod away will you.
If you tell me what you're looking for pal, I can help you.
What ya looking for?
You got a lot of nerve.
Look I...
I gotta sleep in this room pal.
You're going to have a nice long sleep.
You know it ain't right for you coppers to come in here like this...
Tear a guy's room up.
It ain't right I tell you.
You don't come into a...
You've been around enough to know a better place to hide a gun...
I'm not going to be a patsy for a thing like that.
- I suppose you never saw it before.
- I never saw...
While you're here, why don't you two dirty bums take a bath.
When I left the hotel, before I saw you
I went for a walk in the park.
Sitting there watching the pigeons when they shot the guy.
Rocca had them plant the gun.
I saw no one.
No one saw me.
I can't prove it.
I can't prove nothing.
I'm dead.
- I going to see Rocca.
- You stay away from him...
I don't want him knowing anything about you, see?
Why couldn't they have waited just one night.
- Go on.
Get out.
- I'll come back on Friday.
- I won't be here.
I'll see you next Monday when I come up for trial.
- A month's too long to wait.
- Time's up!
Board!
Slow down.
We don't want to get picked up for speeding.
- You're all right honey.
- I've got you some clothes and stuff.
They're in the back with mine.
- Were you seen at the station?
- I don't think so.
- We'll must split up for a couple days.
- No
I've lived without you enough.
- Everyone will be looking for me.
- Then they'll be looking for both of us
Your luck is due for a change.
Fat slob Rocca double-crossed me.
He's gotta die.
- I don't care if I go with him.
- Well I do.
I'm gonna rub this guy.
I'm gonna be moving fast.
I don't care what you do.
I'm staying with you.
Then we're going back to Chicago.
That's the way it has to be.
They were coming up the steps.
And he was laughing.
Real loud.
He's not laughing now.
I put two slugs in his big fat belly.
Him and the other two.
- Baby. easy.
- Take them a month to scrape him off the cement.
Stop it baby.
It's all over.
Big blue Rocca.
All it took to cut him down to size was this.
the cops will sure be looking for Lester Gillis now.
They won't be looking for Nelson.
- What d'you mean?
- You got all of me except my name.
Why don't you take that too.
Nelson?
Yeah, OK.
Any name's better than my old man's.
- I need a drink.
Find a drug store.
- Have you got a prescription Mr...
Nelson?
Yeah.
I've got a prescription...
Mrs. Nelson.
they're selling radios now.
You don't need that.
- Give me a pint of Harpers.
- Got a prescription?
While I'm getting it, give me the whiskey.
This prescription call for two bottles and everything in the tin box.
I'll be right with you.
Don't move.
- I...
I've been hit.
- Bad?
I...
I think it's just my shoulder.
- I'll get you to a doctor.
- a doctor?
- Are you nuts?
I can't go to a doctor.
- The one I know you can.
Take it easy baby.
It's a long ride.
Wait here baby.
Lie still.
They'll come and get you.
Alright, honey.
Coming.
Coming.
I have to see the doc right away.
- Do we know you?
- You ought to.
Oh yeah.
I'll see if he's up.
Patient to see you Dr. Saunders.
- Go on in.
- Thank you.
Doctor Saunders?
Susan, eh, right?
I never forget the free ones.
There's a man in the car, he's...
- He's hurt.
- Do I know him?
- He's my husband.
- Don't remember you being married.
He's bleeding badly.
Won't you hurry?
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
The doctor'll take care of him.
Our Martha will take the deposit.
Give me a cigarette will you.
What you trying to do, kill him?
You two must have just got married.
A sick man's lucky to have a tonic like that around.
When do we get out of here?
- Any particular hurry?
- You don't come cheap.
- Neither does this room.
- Let's see.
Well, you could get out of here tomorrow.
But I wouldn't advise it.
And this isn't a medicine man speaking.
You're lucky it was only a.22.
They leave a nice, clean, small hole.
If he puts his hands on you again, he's going to be a patient here himself.
Come here Sue.
- You heard what the doctor said.
- That I could get out of here tomorrow.
I'm good for you baby.
Honey you're just what the doctor ordered.
I was camping and the gasoline stove blew up in my face.
Did I ask you?
I was saving you the trouble.
My husband didn't know his rabbit gun was loaded.
Yeah.
Here's something for you to read pal.
They've got you going in the wrong direction.
Even got the wrong name.
Hey.
That fellow there...
I wonder what puss is under those bandages.
Whoever it is, he won't be doing any talking.
- Hey, did you notice his fingers?
- Yeah.
Go get the doc and find out who he is.
And don't let him touch you.
I don't want him near you.
I don't want his fingerprints on you.
You boys wait here.
Come on buddy.
Well boys...
- Who's the baby face?
- The one I wrote you about.
- His name's Gillis.
- The name is Nelson.
- Dillinger.
- I heard about you.
- Still carrying around that wooden gun?
- No I traded that in for a chopper.
- Know how to use one.
- Just pull the trigger and hang on.
You better know what you're talking about.
What's the job in line Bessell?
Now pay day's Friday.
The paymaster's office is right here.
The money wagon pulls in exactly 11:55.
It better be.
The men will be swarming all over the joint for lunch at noon.
Was I ever wrong yet, Johnny?
You better not be wrong about what's in that money wagon either.
Been around $70,000 every week for the last six months.
Does the armored car back up to the paymasters office, or park alongside?
- It pulls alongside.
- How do we get in the joint?
There's a fence and a gate and guards at the gate.
- Just asking a question.
- OK Baby Face, you got your answer.
My name is Nelson.
I like nicknames.
What outfits service the joint, you know, milk bottled water, ice.
Ones that use closed trucks.
Or did you forget to find out.
How many jobs have I sold you Johnny?
The ones with the check mark only come when called, the others every day.
I want to come every day Ralph.
Any of you jokers ever learnt a trade?
I can put a washer on a faucet.
- Or unplug a stopped up can.
- That's good enough.
Pick yourself a beat up paneled truck.
Fix it like it comes from Ace Plumbing Company.
Put some tools in it.
We ain't the kind of plumbers that go home to get them.
See you.
Come on.
So that's the big man, huh?
Number one on the G list big enough for ya?
Yes.
That's big enough.
Somebody dropped their watch down the drain or something.
- Be kind enough to open the gate.
- Is Joe sick?
Yeah, hangover.
Got to stop making his own.
Does it take two of you to fix a drain?
Ever try running a snake though all by yourself pal?
Let me look at your work order.
Alright.
Go ahead.
Tell Joe to lay off the cleaner fluid.
Park it over there by the fire hydrant.
- About that time,
- Yeah.
- Sure you know how to use that thing?
- Are you kidding?
How come you didn't use a chopper on Rocca and his boys?
Who's Rocco?
If you didn't know, you wouldn't be sitting along side me.
Truck's late.
Tell me something I don't know.
What's the matter with you?
Give us a hand.
Get in there.
Come on.
Hurry it up.
Captain Moores, Mr. Markey.
Markey's with our F.B.I. in Chicago, assigned to the Dillinger case.
We followed your man's trail this far and then lost it.
- It was Dillinger?
- We're almost sure.
We'll know positively pretty soon.
Fingerprints are all over the truck,
Blood too.
Somebody got it bad.
Alas poor Yorrick.
I knew him well.
Hey Doc.
Save some of that.
He might as well have kept his own face for all the good my retread job did him.
He didn't get much mileage out of it did he?
And here's a pillow for his head.
Are you gentlemen sure that's deep enough?
D'you want it deeper?
Well, I imagine it will suffice.
Poor John Hamilton.
Unwept, unhonoured and unsung.
But he won't be lonely.
There are many of his ilk hereabouts, sleeping here in unmarked graves.
- The wages of sin.
Et tu Brutus.
- Shut up.
- Why don't you cover yourself up.
- Hey, I'm trying to get a tan.
That ain't all you'll get.
The sun is shining.
Take advantage of it.
I sunburn easy.
You need some suntan lotion.
I've got some in my office.
Why not bring me some next time.
Come to the office my dear.
It's all in the way it's applied.
Like he says.
If you're not careful, you'll wind up being your own patient.
That wouldn't be the first time a woman got me into trouble.
Then I lost my license.
I know I should have said no, but she was so lovely.
Just like you my dear.
- We'd better talk about you doll.
- What's so interesting about me?
My ankles aren't trim.
My legs aren't shapely.
My figure ain't interesting.
I was thinking of your practice.
You must meet a lot of interesting people.
I don't find them so.
Do you?
Only one of them.
I'm telling you John, if the doc don't keep his hands off Sue, he's a dead man.
Lay off him baby face.
We need him in our business.
- Sue ain't our business.
- So you're taking her out of here?
- Am I?
- Yeah tonight.
We'll drive you and the boys to a place.
You'll wait there for me.
Doc says I got to stay in bed for a while.
- How long is a while?
- What's it to you?
- I don't want to stick around here.
- Count the dough you made.
I was thinking of calling Fatso and buying a bank job for us.
Forget it.
I said forget it!
They're my boys.
You don't give them orders.
You're not cold enough inside.
- What's that mean?
- You blow up too easy.
Like when that whistle went off, you shoot up the joint.
If you don't want me around I can always...
I want you around as long as you do as you're told.
- You're the number one man John.
- That's right.
I'm the number one man.
Pull the car round the back Miller.
Rest of you guys bring that junk in.
You heard him.
Get the stuff out.
When d'you start taking orders from that punk?
I've seen him use a chopper.
- Are you Bickman?
- Yeah.
- I'm Nelson.
- I don't know you.
You will.
- I thought the big boy was coming.
- He'll be along.
I'll show you to your room.
I'm Ranald Bickman Mrs. Nelson.
If there's anything I can do...
There is.
Get out!
Get me long distance.
Come here and make like Mrs. Nelson.
Long distance.
Give me the Nagel Blueprint and Draughting company in Indianapolis.
Nagel Blueprint Draughting.
Nagel speaking.
Hello, Nagel?
This is Nelson.
Nelson.
Remember we went to school together in Danville.
School?
Oh, yes.
Baby Face.
Boss told me to call you and ask if you had a job for him.
- Why didn't he call me himself?
- He's not feeling so good Fatso.
He told me to call instead.
Yes I have something I think might interest him.
Is your office still in the same place?
No.
No, we moved.
You know a guy by the name of Bickman?
- Yes I know him.
- How long till you get here?
I'll be on my way in a half hour.
Extra here.
Hot off the press.
They've finally done it.
Prohibition has been repealed.
Get your extra here!
That's going to make a lot of people happy.
Yeah, a lot of other people unhappy.
Hey, somebody coming up in a car.
Come on.
Hold it, hold it!
- Alright, it's just Fatso.
- What's he coming up here for?
Because I told him to, that's why.
Sue, get upstairs and keep an eye on things.
So you got the stuff, right off the boat.
No, right off the shelf.
Didn't you hear.
You can buy it anywhere.
Yeah?
Kind of takes all the fun out of drinking.
And out of making it too.
Put the rest of the stuff on the table.
Stanley...
Take his car and ditch it.
Come along with me.
We won't move till the others arrive.
Wait at the highway then come in on foot
Preston, you and Duncan, come with me.
- Looks real good.
- Not a large bank, but an exclusive one
Patronized by the very best people.
Including me.
- What time do we crack it?
- A few minutes after it closes.
I suppose we walk up to the door and knock and they let us in.
In a manner of speaking yes.
I have all the plans worked out.
It's so simple, I'm surprised no one ever thought of it before.
All I can see is trees.
That's all there is to see.
You can drink this without going blind.
- Where's Baby?
- With Fatso.
Are you afraid of him too?
- I married him.
- You ain't wearing a ring.
How d'you happen to get mixed up with him?
Mr. Nelson.
Don't you want to live like other people?
I wouldn't know how to act, Mr. Bickman.
Call me Ranald.
Ranald.
- That's a funny name.
- Scottish.
But you're not are you?
86 proof.
Are you going along on the next job?
If he wants me to.
You don't want to.
We haven't had much time together in the past few years.
Ever wonder how much time you'll have together from here in?
I don't care.
About time you did.
I still don't want him knowing.
I love him.
Don't ask me why, because I haven't got the answer.
No woman ever has.
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Wait a minute Baby Face.
- Baby we weren't doing anything.
We were just talking.
I know his kind of talk.
There's somebody out there.
They're cops.
Bonner's waiting up the road.
He wants the cars left here.
Let's go.
It's the cops.
We're getting out of here.
We're taking nothing but guns.
A road in back joins the highway, It's rough.
The one out front is rougher.
Move!
Preston, get the car.
Have you gone nuts?
Baby, baby, wait!
Let him commit suicide.
Let's get out of here.
We're not running out on him.
Come on out of there.
We're Federal Agents.
Come on out!
Come on.
Hurry it up.
Get those hands up.
- Where are the others?
- What are you talking...
Go!
Was it Dillinger?
I don't know.
You're dying Mister.
Was it Dillinger?
No.
Nelson.
Baby Face Nelson.
- Hey, what have we stopped for?
- We've run out of gas.
You stupe.
Why didn't you watch the gauge?
Here comes a car.
Get out and flag them Sue.
Get out.
What's the trouble?
- It won't go.
- Maybe you're out of gas.
- Did you look?
- No.
We're swapping cars with you Mister.
- Alright Mr. Nelson.
- So you know him huh?
That's bad.
Look, I never saw anything.
- Start running.
- Give me a chance, please.
Trigger happy punk.
Have you heard from him?
- I asked you a question, John.
You ask too many questions.
- Why not take me to a movie tonight?
- We've seen them all.
We haven't seen Manhattan Melodrama.
That's why you want to go out/
- Showing off that new red dress.
- D'you like it?
I like what's in it.
Is that all you found out?
John didn't answer questions, Mr. Parker.
I'm sorry I can't help you find this Baby Face.
So am I.
Not a line nor a whorl in the system.
Better hadn't be, with what I'm paying you.
Don't hear many of my faces complaining.
They're all dead.
While we're about it, we should do something about your face
- You don't like my face?
- Let me say I...
Find it interesting.
I like it the way it is.
Sweethearts and mothers.
Their loved ones are without blemish.
Their mothers.
I may say also, you're a very fortunate young man.
Luscious helpmate.
Top of your profession.
Thanks to Mr. Dillinger's luscious young woman.
Poor Johnny.
Should have taken a leaf out of Homer.
Ulysses lashed himself to the mast.
To resist the siren's song.
Pour me a drink my dear.
These skilled hands of mine are behaving like aspen leaves for some odd reason.
Give him a good shot Sue.
It'll stop him from being so gabby.
Got an ink pad around Doc?
Desk drawer, my dear.
A clean piece of paper.
You aren't by any chance dubious about the success of the operation?
Drink your gas and shut up.
I think I want to retire.
Honey...
- They're...
- With all the pain I went through
And the $5,000 I owe the doc.
Do your testimonial.
To the greatest surgeon in the world.
How's Johnny Dillinger, Hamilton and Pretty Boy Floyd and the Barker boys.
I'll give you a testimonial Doc.
- Instead, give me another drink.
- Yeah... yeah...
We'll both have a drink, but not here.
Let's have it outside.
Outside on the front porch.
Come on Doc.
Give you a drink.
- Water...
- Just what you need Doc.
- Did you have trouble getting it?
- No.
Then what took you so long?
I stopped by a creek and sat listening to it for a while.
What you do a thing like that for?
Three more men to live with than I bargained for.
I'm sick of them all.
We need 'em now.
Do we?
Hey what's the idea?
You're getting to be an awful big man.
Look what we got here.
Are you alright?
I guess so.
I guess it was lucky for me it worked.
I hope it will be lucky for me.
Let's get ready.
- We're closed.
- A registered letter for Mr. Hall.
He'll have to sign for it personal.
- Where do I find him?
- Over there.
Right, everybody...
Hands high.
Come on in front.
Don't press those buzzers.
- Or I'll rip this joint to pieces.
- Do as he says.
Come on!
Stay away from that buzzer or it'll be the last move you make buddy.
Get up.
Come on over there.
Move!
- How is it back there?
- Just a second.
You've had it, come on.
The boss goes with us.
If I hear an alarm he's dead.
How come a little guy like you ever become a bank manager?
I studied and...
- worked hard.
- Size didn't make any difference?
- Well I suppose...
- Ever try wearing lifts?
I do wear them.
You sure are little
Alright Harvey.
This place is alright.
Get out.
Go on.
Hitch yourself a ride home.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Baby.
- Hiya Honey.
- We're getting out of here tomorrow.
- The whole family?
Get the boys a drink.
Fatso sure picks them sweet.
Get yourself a drink Van, you deserve it.
Hey what is this?
We do all the work and he does all the counting.
Take away that vest and what is he?
I don't need any vest!
From now on, you're going to wear it.
You know why?
Because you're yellow.
Are you sure that's the man Mr. Hall?
That's the man.
You know, you're lucky to be alive.
I know.
I keep pinching myself to make sure I am.
I'll never forget the look on his face when I was standing along side the car.
He had death in his eyes.
And then suddenly...
That look disappeared.
You know...
I think it's just because I was a small as he is.
You recognize this man, Mr. Hall?
Er...
I can't be sure.
Just a minute...
Alex.
Once he sees a face... that's it.
- Yes Mr. Hall.
- Alex, can you recognize this man?
I've seen him twice.
Weeks ago.
Card he gave me said he was a deputy county assessor.
Mason.
That was the name.
No!
That was Nagel.
Fatso Nagel!
Good morning Mr. Nagel.
Come in.
Why not.
It's my office.
What are you doing in it?
Making use of a search warrant a judge gave us.
- Police?
- F.B.I. Mr. Nagel.
- Did you er...
find what you're looking for?
Yes, but not here.
At the Midland First National, up in Michigan.
I don't recall doing any business with Michigan banks.
Do you recall doing any business with Baby Face Nelson?
This is The Nagel, Blueprint and Draughting Company, gentlemen.
Stop it Mr. Nagel.
Nelson killed a federal agent in Little Bohemia.
You were there.
We can charge you as an accessory.
Can you make the charge stick?
Yes, but if you cooperate, we'll inform the courts.
Where is Nelson, Mr. Nagel?
I don't know.
D'you think he tells people where he is.
- We want answers, not questions.
- Maybe I don't know any answers.
Then what were you doing at Little Bohemia?
Say I was there.
Say you tailed me there.
Now wouldn't a fellow like Nelson be cagy about seeing me again
We thought of that.
This is his next job.
- Go there?
- No, but you can say you did.
The Brewers Bank and Trust in St. Paul.
You can say there's $100,000 in it any day of the week.
I can say a lot of things, but how do I get him to hold still and listen?
Fatso, you've been in San Francisco.
You've seen that big rock out in the bay.
You wouldn't want to spend the rest of your life there.
So you figure out a way to make him hold still and listen.
Susie.
Make a call to Daddy from a public phone on the other side of town.
Daddy?
- Yes Baby?
- 1- 1- 6- 2 State Street, Chicago.
11- 62 State Street.
Noon tomorrow and how much?
Shall we say five Baby.
And it's worth every penny.
It better be.
Better be.
We'll take that Mr. Nagel.
Say, how come you didn't tail her?
Or did you?
We don't want her to know we're on to you.
How come you didn't ask the taxi where he picked her up.
Probably in front of Marshall Fields.
But there's one thing we're going to do,
Turn you over to the police.
The back entrance.
Here's the front.
Right here is the vault.
- Do you know the set up?
- You seen one bank you've seen them all
You figure on getting away in that?
This is awful slow.
You drive up awful slow.
Sue'll be out front to pick us up.
That's it.
If he doesn't show up soon, we'll wear out our welcome.
- the help's getting awfully nervous.
- So am I but for a different reason.
I'm wondering if he took the bait.
- We got a shipment for you.
- Hurry up, it's heavy.
He'll sleep real good.
The manager just took some armed guards to the vault.
They must be OK, or Duncan wouldn't have passed them.
Alright, reach up high Buddy.
Hurry up.
Shut up and face the wall.
Come on.
Move.
Right, give it to me.
Alright boys, I've got mine.
You can divvy up the rest.
Alright Sue, I'll take the wheel.
Where are the others?
Back in the vault counting their money.
- You left them behind?
- We don't need them any more.
That money'll keep up for the rest of our lives.
- They'll tell the cops.
- We're not going back there.
Where we're going, they'll never look for us.
Going back to the same hideout.
Ditch the car whilst I change clothes.
- Hey, you missed him again.
- Look at those feathers flying around.
- Who wants an old crow anyway?
- I want one.
We ought to be getting home.
Ma'll skin up if we're late for supper.
If you're so worried about Mom, go on home.
- A couple of kids up there.
- I know.
Lie to me Baby.
Tell me you wouldn't have killed them.
I wouldn't have killed them.
Dinner's on.
Wait a minute.
You forgot to give thanks.
Thanks.
We got a lot to be thankful for.
We're alive ain't we.
Sure we're alive.
We're really living.
We got stew... and bread.
And a sack full of money under the bed we can't even spend.
It'll be the same in Canada as it is here.
- In Montreal there are boats leaving...
- When?
When?
A week or two.
A week or two.
It'll always be a week or two.
Wanna call it quits?
No!
No I couldn't.
I went into this thing knowing the score.
Knowing our time was running out fast.
Let's hope it keeps on running.
Slow.
Hi.
We're looking for someone who knows this area well.
- Hunting or fishing?
- Hunting.
Not around here Mister.
Everything's out of season.
What we're hunting never goes out of season.
I know just the man for you.
I'll show you where to find him in a minute.
Be a dollar five Ma'am.
On up the road, about three quarters of a mile.
A guy called Bill Harris.
Baby.
What's up?
Two men in a car asking for someone to guide them.
No hunters up here.
- Everything's out of season.
- What they're hunting is us.
Pull up and turn around.
That looked like Nelson.
Send out an all points alarm.
Nelson is heading North on Highway 12.
Hand me that chopper.
We lost them.
He's pulling away from us, still heading North.
We're all set up for him.
Get down!
They hit the radiator.
Grab the money and make a run for it.
Baby!
Help me... here.
You... fin...
finish... finish me...
Sue.
No I can't...
I can't.
Those... kids that day.
I was...
I was gonna...
I WAS GONNA...
KILL 'EM!

CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY
THE BAT WAS CAPTURED.
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FAMOUS DOCTOR KRUP.
Have you heard?
Yes.
Bastards!
We have to free the chief.
I know that, Tierno.
But how?
I don't know.
We will find a way.
I've got an idea.
- We'll send him a message.
- That's impossible.
No, you're wrong.
The police will make sure that he gets it.
The chief will then know that we're trying to help him.
Go and get our people.
We will need them.
Okay, Tierno.
Where is the Captain?
Interrogating The Bat.
Have you got accomplices?
No.
So you work alone.
He's lying, Captain.
Two of his men are still at large.
One called Tierno and another one, escaped when they were busted.
Is that true?
I would advise you to speak.
Answer me!
What does this mean?
Answer!
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.
If this is The Bat, who is sending his symbol?
I don't know, Captain.
Maybe those two guys we were talking about.
But I don't know why they are doing this.
Take him away and don't lose sight of him.
This is getting complicated.
We must be very careful.
They seem to be very dangerous.
I agree, Captain.
I've been told that this man called The Bat... was a distinguished doctor.
Yes, but his license was withdrawn.
Why was that?
Because he experimented with live animals... to whom he implanted parts which didn't belong to their anatomy... creating horrible creatures.
How much evil can a man hold?
But, with the evidence we have... we can send him to jail for several years.
I hope so, Captain.
We must not worry about this.
I thank you all for your cooperation.
- Just one more thing, Dr. Almada.
- Yes, Captain?
Give us the description of the fugitives... so as to proceed immediately.
Sure, Captain.
- Are you going to bed, Anita?
- Yes.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, love.
- Good night to everyone.
- Good night, Anita!
At last we shall have some peace and quiet.
With The Bat in jail, this is over.
No, it's not over yet.
What about the Curse of the Gods?
- That's over, too.
- No.
My father lost his life when he desecrated an Aztec tomb.
According to the curse... my death follows his, because I am to blame for what has happened.
Please Flor, just try to forget it.
If the Mummy has the breastplate and the bracelet... she won't come back to life.
Listen, once your mourning is over... we will get married and you will forget everything.
In the meantime, stay with us.
My daughter and I need you.
You are so kind.
That was quite a scare!
When I recall what happened to us... my heart starts kicking.
Really?
You always faint when there's some sort of trouble.
Of course!
Why should I risk my head?
You are a hero!
My dear friend, I'd rather they say...
"Pinacate ran from here" than "Pinacate died here."
Ready?
- When did The Bat leave?
- Not more than two minutes ago.
- Where to?
- That way.
Bastard!
Now you'll have to pay!
Don't kill him, Tierno!
- But, Master...
- I know what I'm saying.
Hurry up!
Let's go to the car!
I will kill this intruder, my way.
THE BAT ESCAPED
Good evening.
Who are you?
- How did you get in?
- I'm a friend.
Then why is your face covered?
It's a long story.
I just came to tell you you are in great danger.
The Bat escaped.
What's your interest in this?
Who are you?
They call me "The Angel."
I try to help you and anyone who is in trouble.
My mission to which I am fully dedicated is to fight against evil.
I wear a mask because it's easier for me to work.
How did The Bat escape?
When he was taken to prison...
Tierno and his men rescued him...
- killing all the guards.
- That's outrageous!
Unfortunately, I couldn't stop them from escaping.
- What will he do next?
- Who knows.
I only want you to take precautions.
I don't know what his next move will be!
Is the police after him now?
Yes, of course.
Their dead partners are crying out for vengeance.
I have to go now.
I'll leave you a radio watch.
If you are in trouble, you can call me.
I'll aid you as soon as possible.
See you soon!
That's not good news.
The Bat is free.
When will this nightmare end?
Eduardo, why don't we leave the country and forget this.
You're right.
We'll do that.
In two or three days.
- Hasn't Pinacate returned?
- Not yet, Eduardo.
I need his help to organize my papers.
Then, we will leave.
It was a good idea that you sent that paper...
It was a good idea that you sent that paper... with the image of a bat.
I immediately knew you were trying to rescue me.
And fortunately we did it, boss.
You deserve a reward and I am willing to give you one.
- What will it be?
- The Aztec treasure.
Will we try again to get hold of it?
Yes, Lobo.
But this time we won't fail.
Nothing will stop us from seizing that fabulous treasure.
What should we do?
Listen carefully.
One night, long time ago...
Dr. Almada hypnotized his fiance Flor... to prove his theory... that he could send her by means of hypnosis... to live a former life she had experienced.
Now you're 20 years old.
- Where are you?
- I don't know.
You have to tell me.
Can you tell me the name of the place you are in?
I need to know.
I need to know!
You have to tell me.
I am... in the great Tenochtitlan.
By doing so... the doctor sent Flor to Tenochtitlan... to the great Aztec Empire... where the girl had lived in a previous life.
She, who was devoted since birth to god Tezcatlipoca... and had to be a virgin... made love with Popoca, a great warrior... who, defying the terrible laws, proposed her to elope.
They were discovered by the priests... and were taken as prisoners to the temple... before the god Tezcatlipoca... to be punished for breaking the laws.
They were cursed by the Great Priest... who ordered to burn the sacrificial pyres.
Popoca was buried alive and was ordered... to look after the bracelet and breastplate for ever and ever... as his cursed soul would never rest in peace.
Flor was sentenced to death... not in Tezcatlipoca's honor... but in the stone of sacrifices.
This is the story of the experiment that I witnessed... through the windows of Dr. Almada's laboratory.
Some time later, he decided to look for those objects... that show the exact place where the Aztec treasure lies.
They were guided by Flor who remembered precisely... the road that led to them.
I saw the breastplate.
It was extremely beautiful... of incalculable value.
When the police captured me...
I was told that Dr. Almada... had taken back to the tomb... the breastplate and the bracelet.
And now, how will we find out where the tomb is?
How naive, Tierno.
I told you the whole story and you still don't know?
Using Dr. Almada's method.
- Hypnotizing the girl.
- Exactly.
Now boys, you know what has to be done.
Yes, Master.
We will bring the girl.
No guns, Tierno.
I don't want the girl or the doctor to be killed.
Yes, all right, Master.
Let's go, boys.
Okay, we've finished.
Flor!
Let's go to sleep now.
Tomorrow, we've got lots of things to do.
That's enough, boys.
Let's go.
Two instead of one.
Yes, boss.
The girl woke up and we had to bring her.
- It was dangerous...
- You did the right thing.
This way we can count on Dr. Almada's help when we need it.
Untie her.
Good evening, lady.
Delighted to see you again.
I hope my men weren't rude.
When will you stop interfering, Dr. Krupp?
Not until I get something that is extremely important to me.
The Aztec treasure.
No, miss.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm not guided only by money.
It's the ambition of success.
The Aztec treasure... is the means to carry out an experiment... that will make me immortal and will shock the world.
And you want me... to take you to where the breastplate and bracelet are.
- Exactly.
- I'm sorry to say... that they are lost without a trace.
Really?
You don't seem to know that my father and my fiance have returned them.
You're wrong, miss.
I know that.
Then you must also know... that an explosion destroyed the Aztec treasure... and killed my father.
My deepest sympathies.
But I hope the pyramid... is still in the same place.
Right?
Don't think I'm stupid, miss.
Assuming that the explosion did really happen... we will turn over the rubble and we'll find what we're looking for.
Not with my help.
Of course not.
I knew you wouldn't do it, voluntarily.
But using your boyfriend's method...
- Hypnosis?
- Precisely.
I'm the daughter of a wise man... and you will never succeed in hypnotizing me against my will.
Quite true.
I haven't forgotten that you are a wise man's daughter... and I also remember that this preparation... influences the patient into accepting any experiment.
Flor, what will they do to you?
Please sir, don't hurt Flor!
Take her away!
Lock her up!
In 12 hours time...
I will have hypnotized you.
They really kicked me hard.
And they almost scalped me.
We can't just sit here.
We have to do something.
Who knows the dangers that Flor and Anita are facing.
Unfortunately we don't know where The Bat's hideout is.
I'll call the police.
No, Eduardo.
That could be dangerous.
If you call the police they could hurt them.
You are right.
The best thing to do... is wait till The Bat gets in touch with us and we'll see what he wants.
I think you are right, but... this situation is horrifying.
I have to wait and can't do anything.
Yes, Eduardo.
There is nothing you can do.
Try to calm down.
Why didn't you ask The Angel for help?
They didn't give me a chance.
Besides, the watch is hidden.
- If you want, I can call him.
- What for?
Now it's too late.
This really hurts.
What a blow they gave me!
Listen.
I don't want to alarm Eduardo.
I'm sure The Bat will call tomorrow or the day after.
You should ask The Angel for help.
So I wouldn't be the only one to get all the blows.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Sure.
- Good morning, Master.
- Tierno.
Bring the girl.
Yes, Master.
Come with me.
Haven't you heard.
Come with me!
Here she is, Master.
She followed me like a lamb.
And there is no more resistance.
Follow me.
- Lie down.
- No.
That's an order!
Her willpower is amazing.
Her subconscious struggles to overcome defeat.
Those are her sparks of rebelliousness.
Lobo, draw the curtains.
We will start immediately, Tierno.
Will you hypnotize her, boss?
Flor.
Give me your hand.
Look me in the eyes.
Look me in the eyes!
You are tired.
Relax.
Relax.
You're tired.
Relax.
Relax.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
She is under my power.
She will do whatever I tell her to do.
What's next, boss?
We'll take Flor to the Pyramid.
But first we have to take Dr. Almada prisoner... so when we are back with the breastplate and bracelet... he will decode the hieroglyphic... and tell us the exact place of the Aztec treasure.
Do you want us to bring him?
No, he might be waiting... and you could be captured.
- So, what do we do?
- I've got a better idea.
You've got his phone number.
- Yes, Master.
- Call him.
Hello.
- Dr. Almada?
- Yes.
- Listen to what I'm going to say.
- Who are you?
You know that I have your fiance and your daughter.
What do you want now, Dr. Krupp?
I want you to come... alone, to this address.
Tell me.
22 Montes Lorenos.
Did you write that down?
Yes.
Okay, I'll be waiting for you here in half an hour.
And remember to come alone.
Because if you don't... you won't see your fiance alive again.
Understand?
All right.
I'll do that.
We will wait till Dr. Almada arrives... and falls in our clutches.
I've listened to everything you said!
Will you go?
Of course I will.
It could be a trap, you know?
I have no choice.
Flor is in danger.
Do you want me to wake Pinacate up?
He told us to let him know if we had any news.
No.
I have to go alone.
Stay here.
If I can, I'll call you.
All right.
Angel...
Angel!
Yes, what's wrong?
We're in great trouble.
Eduardo has gone to meet The Bat... who has kidnapped Flor.
Do you know the address?
Yes, 22 Montes Lorenos.
He could be in great danger!
Can you help him?
Sure, Pepe.
Don't worry.
I'll do everything I can.
Thanks, Angel.
They are bringing him in.
Very soon, the treasure will be ours.
Doctor Krupp!
Put him over there.
Where are my daughter and my fiance?
Your fiance is over here.
Your daughter is over there.
- If you have done anything...
- Calm down, Dr. Almada!
Nothing has happened to them.
She's only asleep...
- under my hypnotic power.
- You are a bastard!
- You scoundrel!
- Shut up!
It's easy to hit a man in my position.
- Coward!
- Dr. Almada... don't hurt my pride because you'll be sorry.
I'm sure you are every inch a man... and I'd love to have a hand to hand fight with you.
But I've got more important issues now.
Once I get what I want...
I promise you that we're going to have it out!
I will tell you what I'll do.
I'll take your hypnotized fiance to the pyramid... and I'll take the breastplate and the bracelet.
You will stay with my men... and when we return you will decode the hieroglyphic... so that we will be able to find the Aztec treasure.
You don't know what you're getting into.
I know, Dr. Almada.
If I told you what happened to us in the Aztec tomb...
- would you still go?
- I would, so don't say a word.
All right, but bear the consequences.
Are you threatening me?
I'm not in a position to do so.
There are supernatural things... mysteries of afterlife of which you know nothing about.
You will tell me all about it.
Your conversation is very interesting... but now I only want to know if you will help me.
And what if I refuse?
I can persuade you.
Then there's no need for your question.
Once I decode the hieroglyphic...
- will you let us go?
- Yes, you can count on that.
The alarm!
Someone has come!
If you called the police...!
It's The Angel.
Thank you for bringing him to me, Dr. Almada.
Let's get him.
Keep an eye on him!
I can handle him, you finish with The Angel.
I didn't think we would be facing each other so soon.
Angel, you have been interfering in my business.
This will be the last time.
I don't care who you are.
You can keep you secret identity.
Once you are dead what's the difference?
I wish you a good trip, white hood.
Take him to the death chamber!
Now, Tierno, let's go to the Pyramid.
Yes, Master.
Flor, can you hear me?
Answer me!
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Get up.
Watch the doctor and his daughter.
If you make a mistake, you will answer with your own lives!
Come, Flor.
We're going out.
- Where are you taking me?
- You will soon find out!
Done!
- He can say goodbye to life.
- Let's go, the boss is waiting.
Pepe, Pepe!
- Yes?
- I'm The Angel.
I'm in great danger.
Come to 22 Montes Lorenos... the address you gave me.
Yes!
Can I wake Pinacate up so that he can help us?
Don't waste time!
Come as soon as possible!
Okay!
I'm coming!
Where did you take The Angel?
He's going to rest in a very beautiful place.
Don't you think so, boys?
Angel?
I can hear you, Pepe.
I'm inside the house.
What should I do?
Go to the back end.
I'm here, and now what?
You can see a simulated door.
To open it... there is a button on the upper left-hand side.
Angel!
Quick!
Push me with that pipe so I can swing!
Hurry up!
Harder!
Go on!
Thank you, Pepe.
I've never been so close to death.
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes.
We have to rescue your brother.
I'm not sure how many men are keeping watch.
We need a good strategy.
Come on.
- What was that noise?
- I don't know.
Let's go and see.
- What's holding them up?
- There they come.
Hands up!
Disarm them!
Take them away!
Angel, thank you so much!
Daddy!
Daddy!
My baby!
Calm down.
It's all over.
Pepe, take her home and stay with her.
- Yes, Eduardo.
- Give me the gun.
And your fiance?
The Bat took her to the Pyramids.
Let's go!
The explosion really happened.
Tierno, bring everybody here.
We have to look everywhere.
The breastplate and the bracelet must be hidden here.
What is this?
Lift that rock up.
Master!
This is the monster that attacked us in Dr. Almada's house.
Don't be silly.
This mummy has been dead for centuries... and was driven out of her tomb by the explosion.
But Master...
The breastplate!
And the bracelet!
Finally, they are ours!
Hands up!
- The Angel.
- He escaped from the death chamber.
Over there!
You, too.
Throw your guns!
Put the breastplate and bracelet back!
No!
Do as I say or I'll kill the girl!
Tierno, quick!
Kill that monster!
Take her up!
Now we are really in a lot of trouble.
I'm sorry that we have driven you to this.
Forget it.
The only one that could save us is the Mummy.
We have to gain time.
Do you think the Mummy will find this place?
The mystery in the matter of spirits is impenetrable.
Superior forces will show the Mummy the way... as it happened on other occasions.
I wouldn't be surprised to see the Mummy turn up... to recover the objects in her custody... which have again been snatched from her.
That's why I think...
Let's go.
The Master wants to see you.
Come on!
Where's my fiance?
She is my hostage, Dr. Almada.
I will release her only after you have decoded the hieroglyphics.
I am willing to give you half the treasure when we find it.
What do you say?
- I accept on one condition.
- What condition?
That you bring her here and wake her up.
Very well, Dr. Almada.
- Tierno.
- Yes, Master.
There's one thing that worries me.
Can you tell me who brings the Mummy back to life?
The evil spirits.
Are you saying that there are powers of a supernatural world... that are bringing this mummy to life?
I told you not to interfere with things you don't understand.
Let's not argue.
Now I'm only interested in finding the treasure... so I will be able to continue with my experiments.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Eduardo.
What's happening?
Why are you tied up?
I'll explain everything, later.
I have kept my word, Dr. Almada.
I hope you will keep yours.
You will now decode this, won't you?
- I will try.
- Eduardo!
- I need a book I have at home.
- Which one?
Ancient Aztec History with the Precortesian Code.
I need it to decode the hieroglyphic.
It's in my library.
How will we bring it here?
Call my brother on the phone.
He will bring it.
Are you going to do it?
- Yes?
- Hold on.
Pepe?
This is Eduardo.
I'm fine, and the girl?
She is sleeping.
Maria looks after her.
Listen carefully.
There is a book on the second shelf of the bookcase.
Ancient Aztec History.
Bring it here, to Montes Lorenos.
To the same address, Eduardo?
Yes, to the same address.
Do as I tell you.
Before we go on... and as everybody seems so sad...
I think we should see our friend The Angel's face.
Let's see if he looks merrier.
We will know who this advocate for justice is.
It's you!
So this is the famous Angel.
Pinacate!
You are The Angel.
- Yes.
- Your fearful assistance.
Congratulations.
You had a good costume.
Unfortunately, The Angel is finished.
That's why you kept running away at times of danger.
And I treated you like a coward!
Forgive me.
I would have never believed it.
Have you finished, doctor?
No, I've still got half of it to translate.
You are too slow.
I can't do it faster, Dr. Krupp.
You've got an hour to finish the whole translation.
If you don't...
Only five more minutes, Dr. Almada.
- I finished.
- At last!
I hope you keep your promise and let us go.
Sure.
You know what you've got to do, Tierno.
What do you intend to do?
Kill us?
- What do you think?
- You miserable bastard!
No!
Help me!
Help me!
No!
No!
No!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me, please!
Now, nobody will know where the Aztec Treasure is.
- It doesn't belong to us.
- And the Mummy?
Now that the temple of the god is destroyed... she has nothing to do there.
She will probably look for a place where she can rest forever... with the objects entrusted to her by his ancestors.
THE END
THE ANGEL´S HOUSE
They´ll now give me coffee
I slowly finish dessert so that moment never arrives.
I will have to rise serve myself and approach him to offer that small porcelain cup
that hasn´t stopped trembling in my hand everytime I´m close to him.
My father says:
"Those were other times there were MEN... now.
But he was too tired
She asked to my father:
"Should I serve coffe?"
-"How much sugar?"
-As much as you like.
He didn´t ask anything to Pablo.
That´s the only intimacy we have ever allowed to each other.
I approach him, he´s not sitted anymore
My eyes see his necktie and stop right there.
They have never reached any further.
That silence the fact that he never thanks for the coffee is between us, the only bond...
That represents his total possesion over me.
After, like every Friday at the same time I´m told someone has come to look for me.
I think of my father who says:
"With who are you going out today?"
Without waiting for my answer, He adds:
"Don´t worry,Pablo and I have a lot to talk about"
I know they don´t have anything to say to each other.
And just as I´m gone my father will dismiss Pablo arguing that the next day he must visit some old brethren.
Pablo will be back next Friday.
I approach him ready to go out and I look at him, defiantly, and say:
"Good night, Pablo"
I say his name so softly, that it drowns on my throath.
"Cover yourself, It´s cold"
How many more Friday nights?
How many?
How many days waiting for him?
Everything is so far...
How can I remeber it so clearly?
Everything began that evening...
I was with my sisters
Julieta could never fulfill her own spiritual promises
Isabel, always absent.
She used to rebel against our way of dressing.
Ever night, before going to bed she used to dress herself like someone who is meeting the loved one.
There was my mother always caring, willing to discover the intention of sin in a gaze or in a smile.
Also that summer, there was our cousin Vicenta.
She always knew what to say to hurt me.
However, I was fascinated by her.
She was everything I could know about the others
She was related to everything that was "terrible":
To be a woman, like my mother
She once told me:
"Would you like to be a nun?"
Then you must know everything
On the local cinema, a movie called "How to be born" is being shown
We must watch it.
That day, Vicenta told me:
(unaudible whisper)
No!
That´s not true!
Then why do they cover the statues everytime we come by?
We know everything!
They´re big, they are 20 years old.
That´s why they cover it.
We will be 20 years old someday too, It´s no big deal to look at them.
Look at them?
But how?
By uncovering them, fool!
No, we will be punished!
The robes are very well sewn.
We don´t lose anything for trying.
At the end of the park, there is one statue let´s look at it.
Come and look, don´t be silly!
Kiss him!
Where are you going?
Ana!
Why am I being sent to Buenos Aires?
I have told you three times
You are too old to be playing with boys.
And aren´t my sisters older than me?
My!
All these questions!
They are old enough to know what a sin is.
Is kissing a sin?
It depends on the intention.
I didn´t want to kiss him.
That´s why you are being brought.
You can´t recognize your intentions.
Least of all, the intentions of other people darling!
It´s always better to kiss a man than a statue.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Are you going to the city?
Could you give us a lift to the workshop on the corner?
Good evening sir.
He´s Pablo Aguirre, one of your father´s bethren.
-Get in sir
-Thank you, our car is broken.
Are you Pablo Aguirre, the congressman?
-Yes madame.
I always read your speeches.
They are really nice but you say things about poor people that I don´t understand.
Maybe, for the time being, ignorance is best for many people.
Yeah, sure...
Oh no!
We are already used to it!
This is Dr. Castro´s daughter.
Oh, nice to meet you!
Say Ramón, has Dr. Castro arrived to Buenos Aires?
Yes.
I think they will meet in the house tonight.
I didn´t know anything about it.
I thought that would be tomorrow.
-How long until we arrive?
-Half an hour.
Are you related to the Moreno´s?
-Yes.
-Your deads were stolen.
Weren´t they?
-I´m sorry, what?
-Revenge, they say.
The "masked of the Night" stole the bodies and the Moreno´s need to start dying now if they want people in their graveyards.
-Are you also interested in that?
-Yes, quite.
They are nothing but fantasies.
Lies that can hurt.
I once met a man, honest filled with ideals and hope, who started to say that he carried dead in his gaze.
His life was ruined.
When one is really good what harm can rumors do?
Nobody is "good" for real
"Goodness" has degrees or moments it depends on casualty, humor.
For example, do you consider yourself to be good?
-She´s a child, Mr. Aguirre.
-I´m not a child anymore.
-Why do you say that?
-If I hadn´t been sent back to Buenos Aires...
-Mr.
Aguirre, we are here
Pablo Aguirre, some years ago he killed a man in a duel.
But he is so young!
Oh darling!
Men just keep getting worse!
From a very young age, the devil gets in their bodies and stays right there!
Naturally, they jump in the "Grill of Hell".
Can you imagine hell Ana?
Thousands of fire tongues touching your body
Ovens, heat, fire!
Can you imagine that Ana?
Go up to your room while Ramón helps me with the luggage.
Nation´s journalism depends on tomorrow´s meeting
So, Pablo Aguirre is our man.
Besides being a brilliant speaker, his last years in Europe and USA, have made him capable of defending our ideas.
Besides, He stands for the liberal part of our movement.
I insist that Pablo is not the right man for our controversy tomorrow.
Esquivel is too high-spirited and we could be affected by that.
You mean to say that Pablo Aguirre will not be able to handle this situation?
I didn´t.
Don´t you remember the unfortunate incident prior to Pablo´s travel?
-Come on!
Women´s stuff!
-Ana, what are you doing here?
-Nana brought me.
Mom will be here in few days
-Why?
What happened?
-I don´t know?
Well, go up to your room.
We´ll talk later.
Well done Ramírez!
So, it´s done gentlemen!
What were you doing Nana?
Nothing, nothing!
I was praying.
Who are you praying to?
God or Christ?
My, what a stupid question!
They are the same thing!
I pray to Jesus.
God is an old man with a beard.
Hope your mother doesn´t hear you saying those things.
But why do you pray so much Nana?
Don´t you ever pray?
I have never seen you making "spiritual bouquets"...
Me? "Spiritual Bouquets"?
For what?
What do you mean for what?
Praying is necessary
The Sin is not only the death of the soul, but also of the body!
The resurrection of the dead is denied to your body if you are in mortal sin.
It will burn for all the eternity!
Take a good look at that painting!
It´s the end of the world!
It´s only waiting one word from God to be unleashed!
An angel will come out of it, and by playing his trumpet masses of fire and hail mixed with blood will fall over the earth
Warm blood, like that of chickens and lambs!
All of that, for just ONE mortal sin?
And the pit of abyss will be opened and locusts that look like horses ready for war will come out of it
...and they will have woman´s hair...
-Look who´s there!
-Her name is Ana.
-Ana, Banana, Manzana!
-How old are you?
-Why don´t you come down?
-We do play.
-Cat got your tongue?
-Come out of there!
-Forget about her!
I see a picture like this everyday, bigger and in a frame.
Also in a museum.
In a museum eh?
Three naked women?
-How old are you?
-Im 14 years old and what I´m saying it´s true
I´ve seen that picture and you can see it if you like, it´s on my living room.
-and it´s called "The Three Graces".
-"The Three Graces"?
-So, you want to be a smart ass?
-Let´s see if you have seen this at home!
What about that one?
Have you seen it?
Maybe your sisters have.
Look what you have done!
We will have trouble with the jesuists.
It was all your fault!
If we ever get you on the street you will tell the story!
-You are tall enough to reach the picture, help us, otherwise we will tell your father!
We will tell him those pictures are yours and of your sisters!
Ana, why are you jumping out of the window?
-Nothing!
-Well, give me a kiss, I´ve got to go to the Congress!
-Oh dad!
-What´s wrong?
Don´t you worry, you won´t be alone.
Your sisters will be here in the afternoon.
(singing) "And where are you going with that tied lump?
"I´ll throw it in the lake, it´s Ernesto Conrado´s body"
Nana, how was the last duel at home?
I can still see it... the night was clear.
The moon was very big, like it was hanging up there
Suddenly, two carriages arrived
Dr. Timio descended from one all dressed in black
He was being followed by his godfathers, they were three.
They silently entered into the house.
The door grated behind them.
Your father came out to receive them.
Then, they went into the room...
-Was Dad a godfather?
-No, then Laburdel arrived.
He was very pale, like if his blood was already spilled.
The swords were shining with the moonlight!
The silence was so deep, that no human soul dared to stop it.
And who died?
Haven´t you guessed?
Laburdel was doomed.
Dr. Timi was a famous swordsmen.
And when Congressman Aguirre was in duel, did it happen here?
No.
That duel was never told by anyone.
Was that the reason why Congressman Aguirre left for Europe?
I don´t know.
Maybe.
-Ana!
-That´s your mother, go!
-Is Aguirre who has presented the proyect for the newspapers?
-I have already told you, he seems like an influence to me.
-Well, well!
We´re not here to discuss the decisions of the Party.
-The session is now officially open, with 90 members and 121 from the house.
We will now proceed to read the act of the previous session
By Secretary, we will read a project bill of communication presented by congressman, Pablo Aguirre.
I ask to speak.
Congressman Ariel, has the word.
Dear Presidents and fellow congressmen 1810 represented for our country the cry of freedoom that will make argentinian people very proud for many years... 1816 stands for the ratification of that freedoom.
and 1853 was for our country, the legal consolidation of the "Principles of May".
Because one of the main conquers of contemporary man... it´s the freedoom of speech.
There where any tyranic force starts to sign the empire of their demands only the good, naked word, unleashes freedoom and justice.
One closed journal, one single page banned one deleted word, represent an agression against liberty and culture that civilized man cannot stand!
What Liberty?
Congressman Esquivel has the word.
The words of Aguirre, moving and deep fill me with emotion.
How much would we like to believe in the honesty of his intentions... to sincerely stand up to applause, instead of imposing the interests of our opposition.
But the words need, from that who speaks them, background and moral dignity... not always present at the same time.
If Congressman Aguirre, didn´t speak in the name of a Party which economic axis is based on a series of newspapers that appealing to "Liberty of Press", live on the defamation of good-spirited men...
-I won´t allow you...
-He´s lying!
Ask to Pablo Aguirre, how did his father make his fortune...
If Aguirre refutes that, during his Father´s ministery... the journals "Free Court" and "Opposition", weren´t forced to stop their printing for refering with dangerous persistence to the business of the lands in the South I will be able to retract on my words.
I demand to the President that the Chamber goes to a fourth intermission.
-That lousy Esquivel!
-I wouldn´t have had your patience Aguirre!
There are many ways to defend the ideals of a Party, not all of them are good!
As long as I can´t prove he´s wrong...
The hability of your father is undisputable...
I´m sorry Castro, it´s impossible.
I need to find out something.
Sorry, I´m being expected.
-Hi love, go straight by the river Salvador
You have made me wait so long...
-Did you have to stay in the car?
-I´m tired on staying all evening between them.
I´m tired of being asked if I´m sent by the models of Paris or when I´m marrying you....
Don´t make me feel so responsible for everything that happens to you!
-What are the other women doing?
-Looking out for their children, so they don´t become killers
It´s the second time we discuss marriage this week, we must be getting old...
-you didn´t use to care for that
-Now it´s late, isn´t it?
Cristina, my father has been severly accused on the session... the country is living the crisis of a liberalism, no way out of it... our youth is being corrupted by the example of an intelectualized and decadent Europe.
And you keep bothering me with a situation that was already solved.
-Let´s go home
-I´ll go later
-I invited the Peña´s, they are some of the few that don´t scandalize of our relation
The Peña´s bore me, maybe I´ll stay with my dad.
Your father´s house is a poker table.
-Turn around in Humberto Primo Street, Salvador!
-Forgive me Pablo!
-There´s nothing to forgive, what you said is true.
You are fatter Ana, I couldn´t tell with the dress.
I´m just as always
I´m tired of bathing with my dress on
Isabel doesn´t do it, but she locks the door
You´ll see...
-What´s that?
-Nothing, nothing...
Come with me Ana, I´ll talk to you later...
-And that?
-Take off that gown and put on a decent one, like your sisters!
-I want to use this one!
-Go and take your bath, that´s the last time you talk back at me.
Would you tell me why you kissed your cousin Julian?
I don´t know.
Didn´t you think of the danger that men represent for you?
-No
-Well, you should know
You´ll never kiss a man, unless you are married
-But Isabel says...
-What Isabel says doesn´t matter!
And from this night on, you will sleep in a separate room.
You´re to young to be listening to their conversations
-Ana, ana!
-Did you call me?
-I miss you Ana.
This one only knows to eat marshmallows.
It´s better to eat marshmallows than standing all day in front of the mirror
You will never understand what is to me, to get rid of this horrible thing we wear...
I think I understand
-Let me brush you...
-Ana!
-It´s mom!
-A lot of people make a big fuss abouth the South lands business and although it´s true that much of what we have we owe to it. it´s also true that thanks to that concession granted to foreign investors the population in that area was benefit with all the civilization advances.
Why were "Opposition" and "Free Court" cancelled?
Because they were speaking in the name of a local transportation business that had stocks in the place who were keeping that zone in a state of indigency and barbarity.
Were they being kept that way, or by inertia, or by the State... that was preparing to negotiate?
Even with that, I don´t see a reason for their cancellation.
Everything can look real at a certain time
But in that time, those voices could move the people
And what about the freedoom of speech, the ideals of the Party?
Come on Pablo!
It´s like if you were 20 again.
But you made a profit out of that situation!
I would have made a profit anyway.
There are some men meant to be rich and you wouldn´t be able to be in this economic position.
What´s the meaning of being rich if you have to pay a whole life of embarrassement.
That politics always do the same
The tout of ideals, behind of which the darkest interests unleash...
Didn´t you think that those resources favored the interests of one group could be used in the future as a tool for opression and lie?
Every situation must be defended at the right moment.
I came here to talk about that, but your political attitude matches your private life.
What do you mean?
That your personal behavior, even in the presence of my mother... has resulted in that way of thinking.
And you come to claim for it.
I see that your false puritanism hasn´t diminished with the years besides, you don´t have to be ashamed for anything.
I think I explained the matter prefectly.
Perfectly, with the same hipocrisy that you, relying on legal niceties, betrayed the whole country!
Pepe, bring me the bottle, I´ll need some whisky.
One drink with Mamma Janet will immediatly leave you cool!
I´m not available for anybody
-Let´s put up some music!
-Sounds great!
Guys, I´m going to come off cheap since I´m already drunk.
Send me a little angel, so she can watch my dreams.
Now a toast for the most handsome congressman!
For the most stupid.
The poetess will recite something
Go on!
or do you need to fire to cheer up?
-Stop it man!
-Come on, it´ll be my first fire!
Go ahead or I´ll burn you!
Can I have a drink?
"You want me safe, you want me made of foam made of nacre, you want me white you want me nubian and pure"
The only thing that purifies you is fire!
Don´t you move cause I´ll burn you!
-Leave her!
-Get away!
-My!
It´s very hot!
Open a window!
-The house is on fire, come on!
Don´t go!
Don´t go!
Where are we going?
Well guys, let´s continue the party at a cooler place!
Pablo, Pablo!
While we propitiate freedoom of speech, look what these bastards are publishing!
"C. Esquivel accuses C. Aguirre for the Railway Business"
An infamous charade!
They are not as far away from the truth as we would like them to.
What do you mean?
There´s only one thing I can do...
Don´t go to Congress today, who could believe in their words?
There´s only one way to shut them up!
What´s wrong Ana?
These are the same measures of last year... are you never going to grow up?
Well, are you going to use your evening gown tonight?
Ana is too young for parties.
Why do you say that Madame?
Ana is a woman now.
Why don´t you allow her mom?
A lot of young boys are coming...
In Europe,young girls are being allowed to dance at a very early age!
I don´t think the european model is appropiate
Besides we are in Argentina.
She will go with Nana to the movies.
I was told that the "ABC" is showing a really good movie!
You´ll go to the "Etual", where a movie that is suitable for young ladies, is being shown.
"BROKEN BLOSSOMS"
It´s not your fault Ana, but it´s the third time I watch "Broken Blossoms".... ...aren´t they showing another movie?
These are the only ones we´re allowed to see
-Lillian Gish bores me terribly!
-Me too.
always playing "a saint".
Calm please!
Ladies, Gentlemen because we didn´t finish the showing of this beautiful picture at other movie house, we are forced to alter our program but you will be able to admire the incomparable talent of Rodolfo Valentino... in "The Eagle"
What a wonderful man!
Stop it!
Stop it!
They are stuck like flies!
With evidence, that you may qualify as "refutable" in the year 1912, one of the members of the opposite party that for a strange coincidence, has the same name that the man refered to in this same debate, in his role as Minister ordered the closing of the newspapers "Free Court" and "Opposition" preventing the annunciation of a fraudulent business.
Covering up, dark personal interests.
I ask for the word
Granted, C. Aguirre
These might be my last words in Congress... a few minutes ago, the officialist congressman... using a supposed and sad knowledge,
pretended to diminish, not only my position, but of our Party.
But this is not about making personal defenses.
Personal issues are solved in another field.
The man in his most pure manifestation which leads him to express his feelings his truth, despite growing danger... because, precisely, the truth of every man can become a danger for those that want that the individual to be a spring.
A gear without hierarchy in the monstrous social machinery.
Man has, in his defense, against possible agressions of the intelligence only one thing!
His moral solvency and his word made truth.
The written word is stoic, in action...
Congressman Esquivel has pretended, denouncing an alleged affair, comitted by my father disimulate the gravity of the present situation, in which freedoom of speech which is the root of people´s liberty, can be severely damaged.
The imprisonment of two newspapers directors for difamation of members of the cabinet is not only prejudicial against liberty of press, but it means the most sinister violation to people´s rights.
A nation in which press is not at the service of man doesn´t deserve respect from anyone.
And if to achieve that right, is neccesary for us to renegate of the most rooted feelings of caste and family so it be.
As far as my personal opinion goes, little can I add.
it would be futile to discuss if my father was or wasn´t loyal to his convictions by granting that concession that he believed to be good for the nation´s economy.
The truth is that C. Esquivel, has made manifest an hability for villainy proving himself to be a miserable coward, to whom my only answer is this!
Ana!
Ana, come to say hello
-What did you see?
-"The Eagle"
"The Eagle"?
And how did you like it?
I really liked it.
It´s different to the others.
You can learn to kiss with that one, with who have you practiced?
-Ana
-Mom
I´ll go get the girls and we´ll leave
Ana, you´ll have dinner upstairs with Nana
I don´t think this boys will leave anytime soon
What on earth is that?
Ana, upstairs!
I´m sorry madame, C. Aguirre is asking for the Dr.
He´s upstairs in his desk Show him in.
The duel has to be in this house!
Only then, I´ll only accept to be your godfather.
I´m sorry Dr. Castro, I wouldn´t like to cause any more trouble
On the contrary.
I was eager for a duel in this house they have been passing in the last years but in the good times, Valencia, Cevallos and Timi knew how to duel.
I feel very honored Dr. Castro
The honor is mine.
Have you already chosen weapons?
Guns. 20 steps.
To death.
When honor has been hurt, that´s the way it has to be.
Have lunch with me tomorrow.
I want you to sleep here it´s a tradition in my house prior to any duel.
-Thank you!
-I´ll scort you...
-Don´t bother
-Better, I won´t have to deal with those kids!
-See you tomorrow!
-See you tomorrow!
Come...
My mother won´t allow it
Don´t listen to her, maybe it´ll be your first dance and my last.
Thanks
Is it your first time dancing?
I´ve never cared too much for dancing
However, one feels wonderful turning and turning
I never thought you´d like to dance with me
-Wait for us for going to "Paris"
-Not today madame, I must return, master´s orders.
-But why?
-Didn´t you know madame, I have to pick up the godfathers.
Luckily, those times are back
What do you mean?
That can´t be!
He had sworn!
He´s not in duel madame, it´s in the house´s park, tomorrow at 5 a.m.
C. Aguirre is dueling against C. Esquivel for the accusations made in Congress.
Sin!
In my own house!
What example am I giving to my daughters?
Go, Ramón!
-You´re nuns right?
-What the hell are you saying?
Your way of dressing, you all look like novices, those women that marry God!
If there were more people that dress like us and not in the shameless way they do... things would be different!
You´re so right madame!
If things were different... my wife is expecting her fifth child
maybe we will have to live without him.
Holy Mother of God!
What are you saying?
What´s happening today?
That´s a crime, a crime!
What do you want?
The kid will die of hunger.
I´ll help you.
There are institutions that take care of everything... and if your wife has to work, they´ll take care of the child.
Institutions...
I know all of them.
The only thing you want later is to figure.
Exploters!
You get down here.
Sanctimonious!
-You should have lived here!
-You´ll see.
I´ll call the police!
-Criminal!
-Old bitch!
Police!
Can I help you?
We never ask help from the devil!
Again, and to death!
It´s on the papers.
I won´t allow it!
I won´t allow it!
It´s Pablo Aguirre, the man who came last night and danced with Ana white as marble, he already had dead in his gaze.
I will never allow it in my house!
We have always held duels in this house.
I don´t know what´s so shocking to you
I can´t allow it.
Dueling is forbidden
Specially in this house.
Besides, our daughters are here.
Don´t you ever think about them?
Lock them up...or better yet... let them come down, that way they´ll see that there are brave men.
so they know, as long as I´m alive, that this house will attend all honor calls.
How long will we continue like this?
How long?
Do you have any other solution?
or have you become a progressist?
If it´s for your daughters I´ll stay with Ana or better yet, take them all!
You educated them, didn´t you?
Don´t worry about me, I can take care of myself!
Yes, with a trip to Paris or with any party girl don´t you?
Here we go again.
Do you still believe those stories?
You won´t be saved!
You won´t be saved!
I won´t be condemned by one more duel in my house.
Turn on some candles, maybe if you pray no one will die.
You´ll be damned!
You´ll be damned!
TODAY, SISTER PLACIDA´S PUBLIC CONFESSION
You also like public confessions?
I always come, they are very fun sometimes
I sinned My Lord, I sinned!
Receive me again in your arms!
Being young, I deceived my parents, being with other men!
then my husband, and now my children who take me for a saint!
I´m a sinner, a big sinner!
I regret and I won´t sin again!
-Listen to me brothers!
-This one´s not saying anything the other day, one woman related how a man had deceived her and taken her to a house, saying that he lived there with his family...
"I sinned, I sinned" Love is not a sin!
-That´s in the Old Testament
-Are you sure?
That´s what it says?
Sir, can I borrow your Bible?
-Sir, can I borrow your Bible?
-Of course sister.
-See that no one comes
-What´s wrong with reading the Bible?
-It´s God´s word isn´t it?
-Wait and see.
"Or if he kissed me with the muscles of his mouth because your love is better than wine"
I won´t read this, it´s not interesting
Here it is
"Love is not a sin, I preach... the beams of our house are of cedar".
Why don´t you read it all?
Because it´s not interesting.
Really.
Listen
"that his left may be under my head and his right embrace me..."
You know what that means don´t you?
-You know what that means don´t you?
-No, who are they?
King Salomon and his mistress, hear what it says...
Here it is
"your breasts like twin baby goats, that are soaked in lillies"
Listen to this Ana, this is specially for you...
"We have a little sister who doesn´t have breasts... what are we going to do with her, when everyone talks about her..."
You realize everything now, don´t you?
If you don´t gain weight, on your breasts or your baby goats...
No one will love you.
No one.
-You´ve heard it
-No, stop.
Let´s go.
Why did you wait until now to leave me?
Because today, yesterday and the day before have had a special meaning for me.
I´ve discovered that a lot of things in which I used to believe, are worthless.
they have always been!
What do I have to do with all of this?
You were part of that negative life.
I knew that between us there was nothing but we continued, why?
For feeling failure better...
I cheated on you with meaningless affairs
I was cheating my ideals and my country with small political actions and you, the party and the country allowed me to do so.
because you knew that I was "The Man of the Promise"
a little spoiled, who have to be cheated, because, deep down, you needed to be cheated on.
You´re choosing an elegant way of comforting me even though who you want to abandon is me.
I´m not choosing anything, I´m looking for a way of living
Suddenly, I´m without a past or a future.
with the only possibility of killing a man or being killed by him.
But you are also defending your honor
My honor.
My honor was one of those fake facades.
Behind, there were my father´s weaknesses, the weaknesses of my Party or my own inconsistency.
Now you see how little reasons I have for die or kill
-Don´t go then!
-That would be another way of avoiding destiny
This time, maybe it´s better if he chooses, don´t you think?
They will stand with their backs together
They´ll count 20 steps
They´ll turn around and BAM!
One of them will be dead.
Blood will run, they will close his eyes and they´ll cover him with a cape.
DUEL TONIGHT BETWEEN CONGRESSMEN AGUIRRE ESQUIVEL
He´s here.
He´s on the desk Dad ordered to go down for lunch
My older daughters, Julieta and Isabel.
This is Pablo Aguirre.
This is Ana, the youngest.
You must excuse my wife, she won´t be having lunch with us.
-Mr.
Aguirre, my wife
-We already met.
Shall we go to the dinning room?
No special considerations.
I´ve already dismissed the godfathers
If you´d like to rest after eating, the guest room is at your disposal.
Thanks a lot.
I could use some rest.
Alberto will be here at 3.
Have you thought that you could be killed?
Death is not the worst thing that can happen madame.
And your soul?
What if you kill Esquivel?
My wife is strongly devoted, I don´t know why there´s one of everything in her family
She takes care of the girl´s education.
If they had been boys, things would be different.
-I´ve always wanted to have a son.
-What do you have against your daughters?
Nothing, it´s just that with me, the tradition of this house will die
Noble traditions never die Castro.
Men of good inherit them.
Let´s not think about that.
It´s a very important night.
You can go now
Ah the old times Pablo.
Do you remeber Palencia?
He had a privileged arm
Everyone knew his adversary was going straight to death.
-He´s so handsome!
-He´s too young to die
Not everyone dies in duels.
God saves them.
-This one´s to death.
-You´re still very young.
-See you tomorrow.
-I won´t be able to sleep tonight.
Pray for him, for all of them
I´m sorry.
My mother sent it for protection.
Thanks.
I heard someone in the stairs... and those same steps on the dry leafs of the park.
I pressed my teeth to reinforce my only wish...his death
There were two shots at the same time.
I descended the stairs like a ghost, almost flying
Are you mad?
And in your night gown?
We´ll talk about this
The things that happened after that are meaningless and neither do the months that followed that day
when I opened my eyes during my sickness I could saw his figure lying in the door he didn´t dare to enter.
He became inseparable of my father
He was on my sister´s weddings in Nana´s death and on my mother´s.
But I had lost forever the shadow of the angel in my window Barranca´s Square, the park, the Briseño´s roundabout.
I came out of my house on the mornings and returned until dawn.
I walked in the city, getting lost in the most sad and remote neighborhoods.
but he was always there waiting for me.
I don´t know if he´s dead or alive.
I don´t know if we´re only two ghosts.
We should have died that night.
He in the duel and I in the angel terrace.
Cover yourself, it´s cold.
Good night Pablo
Good night Ana and you, the Party and the country allowed me to do so.
Peace.
You warriors are far from the reservation.
But we're carrying no arms.
The Cheyenne signed a treaty.
Says you can't leave the reservation without permission.
No guns, no bows and arrows.
In the north, there have been many ranches burned, people murdered.
We search for those who have done this.
To the south, we trade with our brothers.
In peace we return to our farms and women at Sand Creek.
Next time, obey the treaty.
That old Chivington sure gonna be disappointed not to have somebody to shoot at.
Yeah.
Come in.
Lieutenant Hewitt is here, sir.
Oh, send him right in.
Lieutenant.
Welcome back, Hewitt.
Thank you, Captain.
Well, what did you find?
Sir, we ran across a band of Cheyenne off the reservation.
Yes?
But not the renegades we're looking for.
How do you know?
They came from the south.
They were unarmed.
Not a rifle in the whole outfit.
You mean you saw no rifles but they were illegally off the reservation.
They were returning to Sand Creek, said they'd been on a trading mission.
"They said."
Have the bugler sound assembly.
Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do?
Teach them a lesson they won't forget.
Double the ammunition ration.
We're marching on Sand Creek.
Yes, sir.
You can't do that.
Don't forget yourself, Lieutenant.
Dismissed.
You know what would happen if we attack a friendly tribe.
My job here os to preserve the treaties and make those beggars keep the peace.
I said you were dismissed.
Look Colonel, every other tribe - the Arapahos, the Paiutes, the Comanches - will use this as an excuse to join with the Cheyenne on the warpath.
Not with me here to stop them.
And south of here?
South?
Texas, sir.
You know the South has cleaned their manpower for the Confederate army.
Lieutenant, do I have to tell you there's a civil war.
We're fighting the South.
If putting Indians on the warpath helps us to win that fight, I have no objection.
We're not fighting our war against women and children.
There's not 10 men left in a thousand square miles of Texas.
Your being from Texas wouldn't have any bearing on your attitude, would it, Lieutenant?
A man fights for what he thinks is right, no matter where he's from.
You're being insubordinate, Lieutenant.
And you're wearing the wrong colour uniform.
One of us is sure dressed wrong, Colonel.
Lieutenant, you're under arrest and confined to quarters until I return.
Hey, you certainly fixed yourself up good, didn't you?
Did you hear what he said?
Well, I got ears.
Well, remember it.
Lebbard?
Yes, sir?
I want you to see that this gets to General Firewall.
What do you mean?
What are you gonna do?
Somebody's got to warn those settlers.
Now wait a minute Lieutenant.
You know what'll happen if you leave this fort.
I'll worry about that when the time comes.
But you're just being plain crazy.
Charge!
Hey mister, ain't you misread your compass needle south or north?
This is the Texas border.
I know where I am.
You had any Indian trouble around here?
This far South?
If you don't mind I'd like to get a canteen of water and a little food.
What for?
Do you ask every customer the same question?
Only if we figure it's a Northern soldier trying to sneak into Texas as a spy.
I am from Texas.
In that uniform?
Better hold him.
Here, use these.
They were just after guns and ammunition.
Don't go to sleep cos they'll be back.
Here.
Where are you going, mister?
You're still aiming to hold me?
Yeah.
Till you get them things you were after.
Thanks.
It's all clear, Sheriff.
Better get the doctor for Harry.
Another thing, I'd better get you something to cover up that uniform till you get where you're going.
Try this.
I have got a lot of people to talk to.
Sure be nice to get close enough to talk to them before they start shooting.
Folks is sensitive to that colour around here.
Say, just exactly what are you?
I guess you could say I'm a deserter...
From which side?
Both, I suppose.
I'll get you that food and water.
Hey, Stella.
Stella.
We've got company.
If he'll stay for dinner, will you open the peaches?
Maybe.
You stay for dinner, we got peaches?
GO back to the house.
GO on.
Mind me!
Hi, Stella.
I thought you're gone for good.
So did I.
But you couldn't stay away.
No, Stella, I couldn't.
In fact, I deserted to get here.
Well, you're a little late.
I'm married.
Did you think you were the only man in the world?
Now wait a minute...
Wait?
Was I supposed to wait, Mr. Hewitt?
Let me tell you - just one week after you left, I got married.
To a good man too, Ed Leathem.
That's his kid brother, Bax.
Stella, you're making a mistake -
Two weeks ago there was a massacre of Cheyenne at Sand Creek.
My regiment did it.
Now the Indians are on their way.
Indians.
You made that up fast.
Get off my land.
Stella, wait!
Your best chance is at the mission.
Damn Yankee!
Get her there, Bax.
Damn Yankee!
Hello, Miss Hannah.
Don't you recognise me, Miss Hannah?
I'm Frank Hewitt.
I don't recognise no traitors.
Look...
The Comanches are on their way here.
I came to you because I figured you were the strongest woman of them all.
If you think you can scare Southern women off their land so you can take over and claim it for your own, you're stupid!
I don't want anything except to help.
You'd better listen to me, Miss Hannah.
Listen?
Young man, I've already listened to three husbands in my time and... maybe I'll listen to three more before I'm done.
Now, you listen.
Our menfolk are all fighting your kind... and we don't want what you call your help and I call your lie.
You better get going before you get some patches on them blue breeches.
Don't you dare, you dirty renegade!
Sorry ma'am
No more trouble out of you now.
Who are you?
What's your name?
Ann Martin.
You Jeff Martin's girl?
Where's your pa?
He's dead.
At Shiloh.
And you'll be dead too if he taught me how to ahoot good.
Look, I'm not here to do you any harm.
Indians are on the warpath.
I want you to get your things and get to the mission as fast as you can, you understand?
I'm sorry about your pa.
Now, you start running.
Put that down Ann, your father and I were friends.
Now git!
Alright...
If you're pig-headed enough to stay here and get yourself slaughtered,
I guess there's nothing I can do about it.
Keep moving, Yankee.
I was a horse's hindsight for coming here in the first place.
You git!
Mr. Turncoat, I guess I didn't talk very clear the last time.
Nor did I. Maybe this will help.
Dora Hartley.
The way I found her; the way the Comanches left her.
You got an ugly way of telling things, Mr. Hewitt
You wouldn't listen to me.
Had to be shown.
There are things to do.
Let's get at it.
Most merciful Father, who has been pleased to take unto thyself... the soul of this, thy servant, Dora Hartley, grant unto us, who are still in our pilgrimage, who walk as yet by faith, who have served thee with constant servitude
that we may join thy blessed saints hereafter in glory everlasting.
# Now all my money's spent and gone
# Now all my money's spent and gone
# You pass by my door, a singer, a song
# Now all my money's spent and gone #
Good afternoon.
How do you do?
La-di-dah.
I thought all the real men were away fighting'.
Are you ladies from around here?
Certainly not.
I'm Mrs. Charlotte Ogden of the Charleston Ogden.
And the first thing that I wish to make clear is that I am not with this... this...
Er... creature?
Thank you.
Our driver deserted two days ago to go and find a new freight wagon when this one broke down.
Found them on Rocky Flats and I thought I better bring them here.
You did right.
Put a wheel on this vehicle, and we too shall be on our way.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
We're expecting Indians.
Indians?
Men Indians?
You might as well alight.
Indians!
Where's my rifle?
Get down over there!
You should have seen yourselves.
You, too, yellow-liv...
Stand easy, son.
What's the matter?
Can't you take a joke?
Not when it isn't funny, Kettle.
I thought you should hear the sound of the only Indian within 100 miles.
Or maybe you really believe that tall tale of yours, huh?
If Dora Hartley can speak from the grave, she'd tell you.
Her killing was done by a stray, full of whisky.
What if you're wrong?
Well, if he's right, I say that we should run out of here so fast that the wind would knock over the trees.
It's too late.
Time it took you ladies to make up your minds gave the Comanches the time to close off the valley.
Two days ago; even yesterday would've been different.
We're asking about today and tomorrow.
I say we stay here.
All Of us.
How many of you ladies know how to shoot?
You can put your hand up.
I can shoot good, damn Yankee.
Mr. Hewitt.
Only the good book tells me what is right to do.
I don't believe in shooting and killing.
Miss Cora, the Comanches won't be reading the good book through their rifle sights.
Miss Hannah, I appoint you sergeant and second-in-command.
Pick yourself a couple of corporals.
I'll take Ann Martin and Stella Leathem.
Good.
Now, get those horses unhitched and put them in the corral.
Get your belongings inside the mission.
Well now, I sure wish you troopers a lot of luck.
Cos you're sure gonna need it.
Going somewhere, Kettle?
Maybe you do need a man around here.
At least, one you're sure is on your side.
At least I chose a side.
Alright, let's get to work.
You heard the man.
Oh Emmett, I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, Mary...
Yeah.
All right, men, use your muscles.
Turn it over.
In there.
Push.
Push!
All right, Lieutenant, all right.
Ready, men?
One, two, three...
Heave!
Any three men, Lieutenant.
Any three men.
Yeah, well.
Target practice.
Good.
Hold it, hold it.
Get your head down so you can see that front sight.
That's it.
That's fine, Hetty.
You all right?
I don't think you'll ever hit anything, but you'll sure in blazes scare them to death.
If I remember correctly, you sure don't need much practice.
I'll take my gun back if you don't mind.
Better than any three men, Lieutenant, any three men.
Most any three men.
Hurry up, hurry up!
Prepare to move out, Sergeant.
Skirts!
Hup!
Tuck them in!
Tuck them in!
Ready!
Charge!
You're supposed to be doing a skirmish, not dancing a polka.
Heckles, get down.
You're just asking for a bullet in the heart of your lap and it's a hard place to tie a bandage.
Do it again.
And this time I want you to hit the ground so hard it splits wide open.
Oh.
Say General, this ain't the kinda work I'm accustomed to.
You sure you can't you think of a more pleasing arrangement for the both of us?
Fall in!
On the double!
You've got to brace your feet.
Brace your feet, girls.
Next!
Hold it!
Hold it.
That's not the way I showed you.
Get over there, Martin.
You've got to use their momentum.
All right.
Fast!
You see?
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working all day long
# Passing the water, darling
# Pass the bucket down the line
# Pass the bucket down the line...
Start on that one over there.
If I say the Indians don't attack at night, why can't we bring water in there?
Because they'll be needing water.
We don't want them to have it.
Sounds reasonable.
# Passing the water, darling
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working... #
It's no wonder.
We're not slaves.
You've no right to work us to death.
Here, my smelling salts.
Get back in line and keep that water moving.
How dare you talk to me like that.
Move!
You better rest for a while.
Sit here.
You'll be all right.
Just a little touch of sun.
Emmett, you've got to help me.
Let's not start that again.
I can't stand it any longer.
I think I'm losing my mind.
You haven't told the others yet, have you?
No, but it won't take long to guess.
Oh, Emmett, please marry me.
Look, I... told you.
I'm not ready for marriage yet.
Got to get inside or back behind the wall.
Behind the wall, men.
Behind the wall!
Now, get down.
Get down!
Alright, let's get to work.
Throw all these pieces down the hole!
It's about ready.
Martin, there's a saying that an army travels on its stomach.
I'm glad we're not going anywhere.
More salt.
Don't waste that lead, its scarce.
Don't reload any of these with the rough edges.
What's wrong With your petticoat, Ogden?
We need bandages.
I had Hetty give up hers.
Take it off.
What?
Take it off right now.
How dare you?
You take it off or I'll take it off for you!
H-H-Hetty?
If you were in South Carolina, Sir, you would be horse whipped!
# Let me introduce a lady, la-di-dah.
# La-di-dah, a lady with a very pompous air, la-di-dah.
# She can't see you pass her by cos her nose is in the sky
# Her boots are fancy leather And her bonnet, they... #
We needed the petticoat.
La-di-dah.
Hi, Stell.
- Can I talk to you?
Sure.
What do you really think our chances are?
With Indians it's hard to tell.
I know what this can be.
Frank, I told I got married a week after you went away.
Ask me why.
You said Ed Leathem's a good man.
He is.
But ask me if I love him.
That's not a fit question.
I guess I married him out of hurt and spite.
I don't blame you for that.
I went crazy wild at what you'd done.
Forget it before you say something you'll be sorry for later.
I'm so glad I can say it at last.
Frank, in my heart I've never been wife to Ed.
When I saw you come riding in, it was like a dam bursting inside me.
It let all my feelings loose.
Hey, Stella!
Stell!
What is it, Bax?
Sergeant Hannah needs you.
I'll be there in a minute.
She wants you right away.
I made that up to make her go.
Now, mister.
Hey, careful where you're pointing that gun.
I know where I'm pointing it.
At a no-good Yankee.
Trouble we're in, don't you think we ought to forget about the war, Bax?
When my brother went away, he told me to look after her his wife.
I bet you've been doing a good job too.
We were just talking about Ed.
Out here?
Like that?
Hey Bax, can you keep a man's secret?
Depends.
You're a good brother Bax but you've got things a little mixed up.
You see, I already have a girl.
Which one of them is she?
You'll find out
Which one?
Well...
There she is now.
Bax, come back here!
Hello.
- Hello, Bax.
Ann Martin?
That's right.
She's nice.
Yeah.
Now you remember it's a secret.
Sure.
It's time you got to bed.
Good night.
Put that gun away.
Look, what makes him so sure that Indians are between us and safety, huh?
That it's too late to make a run.
Dora Hartley was pretty good proof.
Alright, even if he was right, why aren't we better off trying to fight our way through 200 miles than sitting around here waiting to be slaughtered like a bunch of sheep?
That's something to think about.
We can make it easy if we travel light.
Load everyone in a couple of wagons, each takes two horses on behind, and when the first team gives out, we change over...
Simple?
Sergeant Lacey!
Sergeant Lacey!
The Lieutenant and Kettle - they're fighting over there.
What happened, Hewitt?
- Deserter.
- No!
And what are you, huh?
Look, what I did was on account of Hewitt.
He drove off all the horses.
Did you?
- Yes.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
Cos he was afraid some of us had slipped away and tell where he was hiding.
I don't believe it.
It's partly true.
Last night, I heard Kettle trying to talk you into running away.
It sounded like you might decide to do it.
So you made up our minds for us.
Somebody had to.
Even if it might wipe us all out without giving us the right to decide for ourselves?
Right Danny, right but you notice he kept one horse for his own getaway.
That was for scouting.
Nothing else.
Oh, sure.
A likely story.
Ha!
Fine thing, you gotta believe a no-good turncoat.
Just a minute!
Right or wrong about the horses, Frank put himself into the same boat with the rest of us.
What do we do with that varmint?
Lock him up till the fighting starts.
All right.
Get goin'!
Frank, look...
I'm afraid it's your place, Stella.
We can hope they head north.
We'll be ready just the same.
Right.
Back to your posts, men.
Move along.
Move along!
Sentry?
All clear, Lieutenant.
Keep your eyes open.
What you're trying to do for us now is one thing but it doesn't make up for the bad you did before.
What bad was that?
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you do that?
I don't have to live with people but I do have to live with my conscience.
And your conscience tells you to turn traitor against your friends and neighbors, I suppose?
You think your way and I'll think mine.
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.
Fine, Bax.
Say, I sure glad you two didn't bust up.
Bust up?
Oh, don't worry.
I've kept the secret about you being his girl.
Bax, you better go see if the horses are all right.
You told him I was your girl?
Yeah, I...
I had to.
Why?
Oh, he saw me talking with Stella and he jumped to a conclusion.
Stella Leathem?
I'm glad I found out about that too.
Oh, Ann.
Here's your water and candle.
Wait, Mary, wait, please!
Whatever happens Mary, I wanted you to know that I was wrong, so wrong.
No, I was wrong.
Right.
I guess maybe you were to have anything to do with a person like me.
I should never have believed...
Listen to me, Mary.
Listen.
Do you remember before the war, at the monthly square dances, the men were so thick around you, a fella couldn't get closer than 10 feet without having his toes crushed.
Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.
And I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.
What suddenly makes you remember?
We being here, waiting to die.
We deserve to die!
I do Mary, I do but not you and the b...
Oh, darling, we've got something to live for now.
Marriage?
Yes.
How?
No-one here can.
I know, darling, I know, but that horse... that horse will carry us to where there is one who can.
Oh, Emmett.
Could we?
Yes, darling.
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.
Oh...
The keys, darling.
Unlock the door...
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.
Connors and Gibbons, it's time for guard duty.
Your daughter ought to be in bed.
Come on, honey.
I wonder what it's like to have a kid of your own.
One way to find out - marry and settle down.
Me?
New country, new life.
Why not?
Why not?
I knew a shoemaker once who became a violinist.
Hell.
That's a good girl!
Emmett?
Emmett!
Help me, Hewitt!
Come back!
Come back!
Mary, what happened?
Oh, Emmett!
Kettle escaped.
She tried to stop him but she couldn't.
We'll take her.
No!
Help me, Cora.
No.
No.
You lied for her.
One question - why did you keep the horse here?
I might have been able to lead the Indians away before they spotted the place.
They'd have caught you.
Maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Amigo, set up three more.
Well, come on!
Make it fast.
These mornings are terribly dry.
Look, I'm no bartender.
I think you are.
We lost the other one that way.
Tortilla missed.
I do sometimes.
Thank you.
Amigo, how much money you got?
None, I haven't got any.
It's pretty low.
What are you gonna do?
Come over here.
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Put your hands up!
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!
We find out
Let me get down, will ya?
Get them up!
- He is a heavy one!
Let me get down!
Now, there.
Now tell me, how much money you got?
None.
I told you, none.
Oh, amigo, I must shoot you for lying.
I'm not lying, I'm not.
I...
Look, my pockets are empty.
Search.
Then I'm gonna shoot you for not having no money!
No, look...
Tell your boys to stop this joke and put me down, you hear?
I wish I could my friend but we're in somewhat of a dilemma.
If you're lying, he has to shoot you and if you have no money, he has to.
Now, what's it gonna be?
Look, supposing I... supposing I was to tell you where there was gold.
Where's that?
Cut me down.
He said where?
At the old mission, 12 hours west of here.
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?
Oh, I couldn't.
I couldn't.
See there's a bunch of women there, afraid of an Indian attack.
They held me prisoner but I escaped.
They got jewels and gold there.
Women?
Supposing there is no gold?
There is!
There's still women.
And also Indians.
Oh, what are you scared of?
So long as we're locked up in this valley, might as well enjoy it.
Unless amigo lies and there is no women.
I'm not lying!
I'm not!
Then we come back to him and complain.
Keep amigo here?
I'll wait.
I'll wait.
Look, I want my share of the gold too.
That's fair enough.
Are you sure?
Sure you're not lying?
No.
About the gold?
No.
Or the women?
No, I...
No.
Well then, I'm afraid I must really, old boy.
Oh, no.
No!
Please!
N...
After all, it's not good to have too many people know about a hoard of gold or women.
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Mine's a bit lame.
Sergeant Hannah!
Sergeant Hannah!
Yes?
Indians!
Everybody to their posts!
Get the Lieutenant.
Hurry, Indians!
Is everybody at their posts?
Yes.
Well, get to yours.
They're not Indians.
Maybe we've got ourselves some help.
They're white men.
Well, open the door.
Well, welcome, men.
Well, you heard what the ladies said, boys.
Looks like we've come to the right place at the right time.
Correct.
You're just in time for a little Indian attack.
Indians?
That's a nasty word, lady.
DOITtjOSh.
It's no joke gentlemen.
Glad you're here.
We could sure use three more guns.
Hey, where did you get that horse?
Where's Kettle?
Well, he sent us in his place.
That's right, amigo.
He say that you need help here pretty bad.
Three for one.
That's...
Friend, we're only interested in two things.
One of them's gold - now where is it at?
What are you talking about?
Now, get!
These are women?
Get going, buster.
Frank!
You'd better take him inside.
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.
We can't let them women can't get away with that!
Tonight will be different story.
Look!
Whoa!
Hyah!
Please!
We don't mean no trouble.
No, no.
We like Indians.
One Of you talk English?
- Me.
Medicine Man, tell your people we're friends.
Si, amigos.
My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.
It was not a fly.
We're poor men.
We don't have no gold.
Honest.
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...
Big like a mountain.
- Gold only good for white man.
Hey amigo, maybe you interested in white women who brought the gold and the jewels.
Ah, Chihuahua!
Beautiful, everyone.
And a pony soldier.
Chivington.
Chivington's man.
Where?
The medicine man is a man of his word?
Yes?
No?
Where?
There.
Back there.
The mission.
You lie.
No, amigo.
To prove to you that we are honest, we will stay here and wait for you.
Si?
After all, we are entitled to a share of the gold, huh?
You honest, you come with us.
They're headed toward us alright.
Back to your posts.
No, no, wait.
We gotta take a gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.
Roof?
What do you mean?
Move!
Hurry up!
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!
Leave the door!
Go up!
No-one is to move or talk.
One call could decide whether we stay alive or not.
Where people?
Well, they gotta be there.
We've seen them, didn't we?
Yeah.
The Lord is my strength, my rock...
No women, no water.
But they got to be.
They were all around.
We talked to them right here.
That's right Chief.
They couldn't have just flew away.
Chief!
I know...
They're going away.
We're safe.
I know if I prayed there wouldn't be any killing.
It didn't do those three any good.
Alright, let's get below.
We sure fooled them, didn't we?
Frank, what have I done?
Could have happened to anyone, Bax.
Get to your posts!
Bax, look after the children.
You can shoot, get over there.
That's an order.
You will obey if I have to drag you over there.
What are they doing?
Waiting for the Medicine Man to tell them if the signs are in their favor.
Hold your fire McCasslin, they are out of range.
They just want us to get scared and use our ammunition.
Mother Of Moses, you can't get any scarier than I am right now.
This is it!
Let them come into the yard before you shoot.
And don't waste any bullets.
Now!
Get them.
Get down!
It doesn't matter.
It does.
Hold your fire!
Martin, get those outposts in.
Why weren't you firing that piece?
Lieutenant, the Lord was plain enough in His commands about violence and bloodshed.
It seems to me he also said something about "An eye for an eye."
Go to the other side!
Get below!
Martin, Lacey, see if you can get some fire in there.
Is she dead?
She was guilty.
She was stained with the mark of sinners.
Shut up!
Come on, get her below, quick.
Mary.
Oh, what's the use of all this?
We can't beat them!
Let's just wait and die!
Oh...
What are you standing around here for?
Did you think it was gonna be a picnic?
Sergeant, take care of her.
What does it look like out there, Gibbons?
Put her over there.
Mama!
Talk to me, Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Mama.
Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
I wanna stay here with my Mama, please.
I know, baby, but it's gonna be all right.
You come with Lucy, huh?
I'll take care of you, I promise.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Some things the army doesn't teach, aren't there?
Lucy, I...
I wish to apologize for the bad things I've said about you.
And the... worse things I've thought about you.
Forget it.
I...
Thank you.
How many casualties?
Three dead - quite a few nicks.
It could have been worse.
What happens now?
We wait until the Medicine Man says a few prayers to decide when to attack again.
How will we know?
It won't be any secret.
# Them golden steps of gold
# Golden steps of gold I'm gonna wear because they look for me #
Cut the request, we need all the rest we can get.
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank!
They're sneaking up on us!
Hold it!
Hold it!
That's no attack.
They're coming to claim their dead.
Sergeant Lacey, soon as they move away, send a Q6118" t0 bury those renegades.
Right.
I'm sorry.
You did right.
How are you holding up, McCasslin?
Just tired.
I...
I know this may sound strange after the way I acted, but when you're liable to be sleeping for a long while, you try to crowd in as much living as you can in the time that's left.
You're a good soldier.
Go get some rest.
Thanks.
Frank.
I want you to know, whatever happens, I've learned one thing out of it - life is meant for only one thing, every minute of it.
To love and to be loved, that's all that counts.
Stella, listen...
- Please...
And if we live through this, I'm gonna tell my husband what never really started between him and me is never gonna start... and then I'm going home to Chaplain and wait.
Jones, take over here.
You're gonna be on guard at three o'clock.
You better get some sleep.
Stop treating me like a child.
I treat you all the same.
Except Stella Leatham.
That's crazy.
No.
If you can fool a young boy like Bax, cue stoop to lie about me...
If you don't want to be treated like a child, don't act like one.
Scared, Ann?
We all are, you know.
It's not that.
Oh?
What, then?
The love bug bite you?
No!
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Oh, to be young and not know the source of your troubles.
He's a Yankee.
Yes, and he's a liar too.
Hear, now.
If you love him, you help him.
He's got nothing but troubles.
Men gather around a minute, I want to talk to you.
He ought to be back in the army, always shouting, shouting orders.
His shouting doesn't fool me.
Why he's worrying himself sick for all of us.
Trying not to show it.
That's why he's shouting.
Now good soldiers are entitled to the truth.
We can stay here till they burn us out or we can carry the fight to them.
You're leaving the decision up to us?
Why, Lieutenant?
You don't tell us how to nurse babies, so we don't tell you how to fight Comanches.
That's right.
What happened?
Him!
That Medicine Man.
I got so damn mad at him for asking his god about killing more of us, that I loaded up old Betsy with five times her regular...
Oh, look at her.
Five times?
Hannah, He's more than a mile away.
He is?
This gun's only good for 300 yards, at best.
They always keep their Medicine Man well out of range.
I guess I figured I'd prove my God was more powerful than his.
Well, guess I was just hoping for a miracle.
Miracle huh?
Let's go outside and see if we can fix up one.
Yeah, I...
Huh?
Let's go.
Sure you can hit these things?
We'll hit 'em.
Don't forget the rest of what I told you.
Now, it's up to you.
I'm staying here.
You trying to get yourself killed?
Obey orders.
All right, men.
Back to the fort.
That's enough.
What's holding you up, Martin?
Well, it's too bad when a person wastes time until maybe there isn't any more time.
Time for what?
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.
Hard to say I'm sorry for all the mean things I said without having said enough to say I'll regret it.
You know with any luck, I think we might have been friends.
Maybe more than that.
How does it look, Sergeant?
Looks like they're upset about something.
Good luck.
- Same to you.
Now, put your sights on them bombs and squeeze gently.
Frank is running away!
He's running away to do that miracle I tried with that old musket last night.
He's gonna get the Medicine Man.
Fire!
Did he make it?
Yes.
Go with the other children.
I'm the only man left.
I wish to help fight like a man.
No, Bax.
Do as I tell you.
No!
You got no right to say no after what I did.
Here's a gun that isn't being used.
You take that last window.
Guard that window!
We make a great team, Hetty.
Yes, ma'am, we sure do.
I'll get some more ammunition.
Hetty!
From now on, ma'am, you'll have to do your own hair and dressing.
And shooting too.
Look!
You're making a mistake!
Look!
You're making a mistake!
You're killing the wrong ones!
Shut up!
Bax!
How are you?
Oh, Bax!
Cora, what are you doing?
Let go!
I'm gonna kill them!
Ammunition.
Go easy.
We only have a little left.
This thing is stuck.
Ammunition!
Ammunition!
Ammunition over here.
Drag him over to the front.
When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
There it is.
Give me a hand with this rope.
Open the door!
That's good, give me some slack.
If superstitution runs true to form, this ought to do it.
Yippee!
We whipped them!
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
You're a better man than I am!
Ann?
Yes?
I have to go away for a while.
For how long, I don't know.
But I go remembering that, with any luck, we might have been more than friends.
Then why go?
I'm still a deserter...
And I don't want to spend the rest of his life running.
Where's he going?
The defendant will step forward and face the court.
The court has carefully weighed the evidence which has been presented by the Prosecution and the Defence and it is the unanimous verdict of this court...
Ten-shun!
At ease, gentlemen.
Don't let me interrupt, Colonel Chivington.
You're in charge.
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged with insubordination and desertion.
Er... where did you apprehend him?
Oh, he came back voluntarily but with the wildest story ever dreamed by men of having ridden to Texas, rallied a bunch of women and fought off an Indian attack.
That was no story.
The defendant will remain silent.
The General may be interested to know that Yellow Horse and Broken Foot were brought in three days ago.
True, they admitted having been in a fight.
One they'll never forget.
And a fight with buffalo hunters, not some imaginery petticoat brigade.
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone of you!
What's the meaning of this?
We've come to fetch the Lieutenant.
Stand easy boys.
This ain't no bugle I'm holding.
Colonel, this is that phantom Petticoat army you spoke about.
I'd like to have you meet McCasslin, Ogden, Conover, Sergeant Lacey, Melavan and Corporal Martin.
Incidentally, six of the best marksmen you ever saw.
Now that we've been introduced, let's get out of here.
Hold it, Lacey.
Look, men, I appreciate what you're trying to do for me, but you're gonna get me hung.
You women clear out of here before I have you driven out.
Mr. Colonel... if there's any driving to do, we'll do it.
Melavan, what's come over you?
The good Lord let me know if something worth fighting for, a body better fight.
Sergeant Lebbard, have the bugler sound assembly.
Can we have a truce?
- That depends.
Just long enough to admit that the South has counter-attacked in force and... we've lost this engagement.
Also the numerous reports I've received prove that the wrong man has been on trial here.
The evidence is overwhelming, and I might add some of it downright attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, your testimony will be required at the trial of Colonel Chivington in the matter of the Sand Creek massacre.
Colonel return to your quarters.
Stella wanted me to tell you that she took your advice and stayed behind to wait for her husband.
Lieutenant, thank you and God bless you.
That was for the slap, Frank.
I made a good trade, McCasslin.
Thanks again.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Now I don't think I'll never get used to you without gunsmoke on your face.
You'll better try, renegade.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Nancy.
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy to be a real lady.
You think that'll kind of square things.
I think that'll square a lot of things.
Good luck.
And good luck to you too.
Peace.
You are far from the reservation.
We carry no arms.
The treaty says you can't leave without permission.
No guns, no bows and arrows.
In the north, ranches were burned, people murdered.
We search for those who did this.
To the south we trade with our brothers.
In peace we return to our farms and women.
Next time, obey the treaty.
The Colonel will be disappointed to have nobody to shoot at.
Yeah.
Come in.
Lieutenant Hewitt is here, sir.
Send him in.
Lieutenant?
Welcome back, Hewitt.
Thank you, Captain.
What did you find?
We ran across a band of Cheyenne.
But not the renegades we want.
How do you know?
They came from the south.
They were unarmed.
But they were illegally off the reservation.
They said it was a trading mission.
"They said."
Have the bugler sound assembly.
Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do?
Teach them a lesson.
Double the ammunition ration.
Yes, sir.
You can't do that.
Don't forget yourself, Lieutenant.
Dismissed.
We don't attack friendly tribes.
I preserve treaties and keep the peace.
I said you were dismissed.
Every other tribe - the Paiute, the Comanche - will use it as an excuse to join the Cheyenne on the warpath.
Not with me here to stop them.
And south of here?
South?
Texas, sir.
The South's used all its manpower in the Confederate army.
We're fighting the South.
If putting Indians on the warpath helps us to win, I've no objection.
We're not fighting against women and children.
There's hardly any men left in Texas.
Your being from Texas wouldn't have anything to do with it?
A man fights for what he thinks is right.
You're being insubordinate.
And you're in the wrong colour uniform.
One of us is dressed wrong, Colonel.
Lieutenant, you're under arrest and confined to quarters until I return.
You fixed yourself up good, didn't you?
Did you hear what he said?
I got ears.
Well, remember it.
Lebbard?
Yes, sir?
See this gets to General Firewell.
What are you gonna do?
Somebody's got to warn the settlers.
You know what'll happen if you leave
I'll worry when the time comes.
You're just being plain crazy.
Charge!
Hey, ain't you misread your compass needle?
This is the Texas border.
I know.
Have you had any Indian trouble here?
This far south?
I'd like a canteen of water
What for?
Do you ask everyone the same thing?
Only if it's a Northern soldier trying to sneak into Texas as a spy.
I am from Texas.
In that uniform?
Better hold him.
Here, use these.
They were after guns and ammunition.
Don't go to sleep cos they'll be back.
Here.
Where are you going, mister?
You're still aiming to hold me?
Yeah.
Till you get what you were after.
Thanks.
It's all clear, Sheriff.
I sent for the doctor.
I'd better get you something to cover up that uniform till you get where you're going.
Try this.
I have got people to talk to.
I'd like to get close enough before they shoot.
Folks is sensitive to that colour around here.
Say, just exactly what are you?
I guess you could say I'm a deserter.
From which side?
Both, I suppose.
I'll get you that food and water.
Hey, Stellal
Stellal We've got company.
If he'll stay for dinner, can we have peaches?
Maybe.
Go back to the house.
Go on.
Mind me!
Hi, Stella.
I thought you'd gone for good.
So did I.
But you couldn't stay away.
No, Stella.
In fact, I deserted.
Well, you're late.
I'm married.
You're not the only man in the world
Wait a minute...
Wait?
Am I supposed to wait forever?
Let me tell you - one week after you left, I got married.
To a good man, too.
Ed Leathem.
That's his kid brother, Bax.
Two weeks ago there was a massacre of Cheyenne at Sand Creek.
My regiment did it.
Now the Indians are on their way.
Indians.
You made that up fast
Get off my land.
Stella, wait!
Your best chance is at the mission.
Damn Yankee!
Get her there, Bax.
Damn Yankee!
Hello, Miss Hannah.
Don't you recognise me?
Frank Hewitt.
I don't recognise no traitors.
The Comanches are on their way.
I figured you're the strongest woman of them all.
If you want to scare us off our land so you can claim it, you're stupid.
I only want to help.
You'd better listen.
Listen?
I've already listened to three husbands in my time.
Maybe I'll listen to three more.
Now, you listen.
Our menfolk are fighting your kind.
We don't want what you call help and I call lies.
Get going before you need patches on them blue breeches.
Don't you dare, you dirty renegade!
No more trouble out of you, now.
Who are you?
What's your name?
Ann Martin.
Are you Jeff Martin's girl?
Where's your pa?
He's dead.
You'd be dead too if he taught me how to shoot.
I'm not here to do you any harm.
Indians are on the warpath.
I want you to get to the mission as fast as you can.
I'm sorry about your pa.
Now, you start running.
Ann, your father and I were friends.
If you're pig-headed enough to stay here and get slaughtered, there's nothing I can do about it.
Keep moving, Yankee.
I was a horse's hindsight for ever coming here.
You get!
Mr Turncoat, I guess I didn't talk very clear last time.
Nor did I. So maybe this will help.
Dora Hartley.
The way the Comanches left her.
That's an ugly way of telling things
You wouldn't listen to me.
You had to be shown.
There are things to do.
Let's go.
Most merciful Father, who has been pleased to take unto Thyself the soul of this, thy servant, Dora Hartley, grant unto us, who are still in our pilgrimage, who walk as yet by faith,
that we may join Thy blessed saints hereafter in glory everlasting.
# Now all my money's spent and gone
# You pass by my door, a singer, a song
# Now all my money's spent and gone#
Good afternoon.
How do you do?
La-di-dah.
I thought all the real men were away fighting'.
Are you ladies from around here?
Certainly not.
I'm Mrs Charlotte Ogden of the Charleston Ogdens.
The first thing I wish to make clear is that I am not with this... this...
Er, creature?
Thank you.
Our driver left two days ago to find a new wagon when we broke down.
I thought I should bring 'em here.
You did right.
Put a wheel on this vehicle, and we shall be on our way.
That won't be possible.
We're expecting Indians.
Indians?
Men Indians?
You might as well alight.
Indians!
Indians!
Where's my rifle?
Get down over there!
You should have seen yourselves.
You, too, yellow-liv...
Stand easy, son.
What's wrong?
Can't take a joke?
Not when it isn't funny.
I thought you should hear the sound of the only Indian within 100 miles.
Or maybe you believe your tall tale.
If Dora Hartley could speak from the grave, she'd tell you.
She was killed by a stray.
What if you're wrong?
If he's right, we should run so fast the wind would knock over the trees.
By the time you ladies made up your minds, the Comanches could have closed off the valley.
Two days ago would've been different.
We're asking about today and tomorrow.
I say we stay here.
All of us.
How many ladies know how to shoot?
You can put your hand up.
I can shoot good, damn Yankee.
Mr Hewitt.
Only the Good Book tells me what is right to do.
I don't believe in killing.
Miss Cora, the Comanches won't be reading it through their rifle sights
Miss Hannah, I appoint you sergeant and second-in-command.
Pick a couple of corporals.
Ann Martin and Stella Leathem.
Good.
Now, get those horses unhitched and put them in the corral.
Get your things inside the mission.
I sure wish you troopers luck.
Cos you're sure gonna need it.
Going somewhere, Kettle?
Maybe you do need a man around here.
One you're sure is on your side.
At least I chose a side.
Let's get to work.
You heard the man.
Emmett, I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, Mary...
Yeah.
All right, men, use your muscles.
Turn it over.
In there.
Push.
Push!
All right, Lieutenant, all right.
Ready, men?
One, two, three...
Heave!
Any three men, Lieutenant.
Yeah, well.
Target practice.
Good.
Hold it, hold it.
Get your head down so you can see that front sight.
That's fine, Hetty.
Are you all right?
You won't hit anything, but you'll sure as blazes scare them to death.
If I remember correctly, you don't need much practice.
I'll take my gun back if you don't mind.
Better than any three men, Lieutenant, any three men.
Most any three men.
Hurry up, hurry up!
Prepare to move out, Sergeant.
Skirts!
Up!
Tuck them in!
Tuck them in!
Ready!
Charge!
You're supposed to be doing a skirmish, not dancing a polka.
Heckles, get down.
The back of your lap is a hard place to tie a bandage.
This time I want you to hit that ground so hard it splits wide open.
Oh.
General, this ain't the kinda work I'm accustomed to.
Can't you think of a more pleasing arrangement for the both of us?
Fall in!
On the double!
You've got to brace your feet, girls.
Next!
Hold it!
Hold it.
That's not the way I showed you.
Get over there, Martin.
You've got to use their momentum.
All right.
Fast.
You see?
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working all day long
# Passing the water, darling
# Pass the bucket down the line
# Pass the bucket down the line...
Start on that one over there.
If Indians don't attack at night, why can't we bring water in there?
Because they'll be needing water.
Sounds reasonable.
# Passing the water, darling
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working... #
It's no wonder.
We're not slaves.
You've no right to work us to death.
Hetty, my smelling salts.
Keep that water moving.
How dare you talk to me like that.
Move!
You'd better rest for a while.
Sit here.
You'll be all right.
Just a little touch of sun.
Emmett, you've got to help me.
Let's not start that again.
I can't stand it any longer.
I think I'm losing my mind.
You haven't told the others?
No, but it won't take long to guess.
Oh, Emmett, please marry me.
Look, I... told you.
I'm not ready for marriage yet.
Get inside or back behind the wall.
Behind the wall, men.
Now, get down.
Get down!
Let's get to work.
Throw all these pieces down the hole!
It's about ready.
There's a saying that an army travels on its stomach.
I'm glad we're not going anywhere.
More salt.
Don't waste that lead, it's scarce.
Don't reload these with rough edges.
What's wrong with your petticoat, Ogden?
We need bandages.
I had Hetty give up hers.
Take it off.
What?
Take it off right now.
How dare you?
Take it off, or I'll do it for you.
H-h-hetty?
If you were in South Carolina, sir, you would be horsewhipped.
Let me introduce a lady, la-di-dah.
La-di-dah, a lady with a very pompous air, la-di-dah.
# She can't see you pass her by Cos her nose is in the sky
# Her boots are fancy leather And her bonnet... #
We needed the petticoat.
La-di-dah.
Hi, Stell.
- Can I talk to you?
Sure.
What do you really think our chances are?
With Indians it's hard to tell.
I know what this can be.
Frank, I said I got married a week after you went away.
Ask me why.
You said Ed Leathem's a good man.
He is.
But ask me if I love him.
That's not a fit question.
I married him out of hurt and spite.
I don't blame you.
I went crazy at what you'd done.
Don't say something you'll regret later.
I'm so glad I can say it at last
In my heart I've never been his wife
When I saw you come riding in, it was like a dam bursting.
It let all my feelings loose.
Hey, Stella!
Stella!
What is it, Bax?
Sergeant Hannah needs you.
I'll be there in a minute.
She wants you right away.
I made that up to make her go.
Now, mister.
Careful where you point that gun.
I'm pointing it at a no-good Yankee.
Shouldn't we forget about the war?
My brother told me to look after her
You're doing a good job.
We were just talking about Ed.
Out here?
Like that?
Bax, can you keep a man's secret?
Depends.
You've got things mixed up.
See, I already have a girl.
Which one is she?
You'll find out
Which one?
Well...
There she is now.
Come back here!
Hello.
- Hello, Bax.
Ann Martin?
That's right.
She's nice.
Yeah.
You remember it's a secret.
Sure.
It's time you got to bed.
Good night.
Put that gun away.
Look, what makes him so sure that Indians are between us and safety?
Dora Hartley was pretty good proof.
Then why aren't we better off trying to fight our way through than waiting to be slaughtered like a bunch of sheep?
That's something to think about.
We can make it easy if we travel light.
Load everyone in a couple of wagons, stick two horses on behind, and when one team gives out, change over.
Simple?
Sergeant Lacey!
Sergeant Lacey!
The Lieutenant and Kettle - they're fighting.
What happened, Hewitt?
- Deserter.
And what are you?
Hewitt drove off all the horses.
Did you?
- Yes.
Why?
He was afraid we'd leave and tell where he was hiding.
I don't believe it.
It's partly true.
I heard Kettle trying to talk you into running away.
Sounded like you might.
So you made up our minds for us.
Somebody had to.
Without letting us decide for ourselves.
But he kept one horse for his own getaway.
That was for scouting.
Oh, sure.
A likely story.
Ha!
Fine thing to have to believe a turncoat.
Just a minute!
Frank stayed with the rest of us.
What about that varmint?
Lock him up till the fighting starts.
All right.
Get goin'!
Frank, look.
I'm afraid it's your place, Stella.
We can hope they head north.
But we'll be ready.
Right.
Back to your posts, men.
Move along.
Move along!
Sentry?
All clear, Lieutenant.
Keep your eyes open.
What you're trying to do for us now doesn't make up for the bad before.
What bad was that?
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you?
I have to live with my conscience.
And it makes you turn traitor against friends and neighbours?
You think your way, I'll think mine.
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.
I'm glad you two didn't bust up.
Bust up?
I've got the secret about you being his girl.
Bax, see if the horses are all right.
You told him I was your girl?
Yeah, I...
I had to.
Why?
He saw me with Stella and jumped to a conclusion.
Stella Leathem?
I'm glad I found out, too.
Oh, Ann.
Here's your water and candle.
Wait, Mary, please!
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I was wrong, so wrong.
No, I was wrong.
I guess maybe you were to have anything to do with me.
I should never have believed...
Listen to me, please.
Listen.
Before the war at the square dances, men were so thick around you, a fella couldn't get near without having his toes crushed.
Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.
I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.
What makes you remember now?
Being here, waiting to die.
We deserve to die!
I do, but not you and the b...
Oh, darling, we've got something to live for now.
Marriage?
Yes.
How?
No-one here can.
I know, darling, I know, but that horse will carry us to where there is one who can.
Oh, Emmett.
Could we?
Yes, darling.
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.
Oh...
The keys, darling.
Unlock the door.
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.
Conover and Gibbons, gardening time.
Your daughter ought to be in bed.
Come on, honey.
I wonder what it's like to have a kid.
One way to find out - marry and settle down.
Me?
New country, new life.
Why not?
Why not?
I knew a shoemaker once who became a violinist.
Hell.
There's a good girl!
Emmett?
Emmett!
Help me, please!
Come back!
Come back!
Mary, what happened?
Oh, Emmett!
Kettle escaped.
She tried to stop him
We'll take her.
No!
Help me, Cora.
No.
No.
You lied for her.
One question - why did you keep the horse here?
I could've led the Indians away before they spotted the place.
They'd have caught you.
Maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Amigo, set up three more.
Well, come on!
Make it fast.
These mornings are terribly dry.
Look, I'm no bartender.
I think you are.
We lost the other one.
Tortilla missed.
I do sometimes.
Thank you.
Amigo, how much money you got?
None, I haven't got any.
It's pretty low.
What are you gonna do?
Come over here.
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Put your arms up!
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!
We find out
Let me get down, will ya?
Get them up!
- He is a heavy one!
Let me get down!
Now, there.
Tell me, how much money you got?
None.
I told you, none.
Oh, amigo, I must shoot you for lying.
I'm not lying, I'm not.
I...
Look, my pockets are empty.
Search.
Then I'm gonna shoot you for not having no money!
No, look...
Will you tell your boys to stop this joke and cut me down?
My friend, we're in somewhat of a dilemma.
If you're lying, he has to shoot you.
If you have no money, he has to.
Now, what's it gonna be?
Look, supposing I... supposing I was to tell you where there was gold.
Where's that?
Cut me down.
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?
I couldn't.
There's a bunch of women there, afraid of an Indian attack.
They held me prisoner, I escaped.
They got jewels and gold there.
Women?
Supposing there is no gold?
There is!
There's still women.
And also Indians.
So long as we're in this valley, let's enjoy it.
Unless he lies and there is no women
I'm not lying!
Then we come back and complain.
Keep amigo here?
I'll wait.
Look, I want my share of the gold, too.
That's fair enough.
Are you sure you're not lying?
No.
About the gold?
No.
Or the women?
No, I...
No.
I'm afraid I really must, old boy.
Oh, no.
No!
Please!
N...
It's not good to have too many people know about a hoard of gold.
Or women.
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Mine's a bit lame.
Sergeant Hannah!
Sergeant Hannah!
Yes?
Indians!
Everybody to their posts!
Get the Lieutenant.
Hurry, Indians!
Is everybody at their posts?
Yes.
Well, get to yours.
They're not Indians.
Maybe we've got some help.
They're white men.
Well, open the door.
Well, welcome, men.
You heard, boys.
Looks like we're at the right place at the right time.
Correct.
You're just in time for a little Indian attack.
Indians?
That's a nasty word.
Don't josh.
It's no joke.
Glad you're here.
We could sure use three more guns.
Hey, where d'you get that horse?
Where's Kettle?
He sent us in his place.
That's right, amigo.
He say you need help here pretty bad.
Three for one.
That's...
We only interested in two things.
One's gold - where's it at?
What are you talking about?
Now, get!
These are women?
Get going, buster.
Frank!
You'd better take him inside.
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.
Them women can't get away with that!
Tonight'll be different.
Look!
Whoa!
Hyah!
Peace!
We don't mean no trouble.
No, no.
We like Indians.
One of you talk English?
- Me.
Tell your people we're friends.
Si, amigos.
My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.
It was not a fly.
We're poor men.
Honest
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...
Big, like a mountain.
- Gold only good for white man.
Amigo, maybe you interested in white women who brought the gold.
Ah, Chihuahua!
Beautiful, every one.
And a pony soldier.
Chivington.
Chivington's man.
Where?
The medicine man is a man of his word?
Yes?
No?
Where?
There.
Back there.
The mission.
You lie.
No, amigo.
To prove that we are honest, we will stay here and wait for you.
Si?
We are entitled to some of the gold.
You honest, you come with us.
They're headed toward us.
Back to your posts.
Wait.
We gotta gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.
Roof?
Move!
Hurry up!
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!
Leave them open!
Go up!
No-one moves or talks.
One call could decide whether we stay alive or not.
Where people?
Well, they gotta be there.
We seen them, didn't we?
Yeah.
The Lord is my strength, my rock...
No women, no water.
But they got to be.
They were all around.
We talked to them.
That's right.
They couldn't have just flew away.
Chief!
I know...
They're going away.
We're safe.
I knew if I prayed there would be no killing.
It didn't do those three any good.
Let's get below.
We sure fooled them.
Frank, what have I done?
Coulda happened to anyone.
Get to your posts.
Bax, look after the children.
You can shoot, get over there.
That's an order.
You will obey if I have to drag you over there.
What are they doing?
He's gonna tell them if the signs are in their favour.
Mother of Moses, you can't get any scareder than I am right now.
Let them come into the yard before you shoot.
Don't waste any bullets.
Now!
Get them.
Get down!
It doesn't matter.
It does.
Hold your fire!
Martin, get those outposts in.
Why weren't you firing that piece?
The Lord was plain in His commands about violence and bloodshed.
He also said "An eye for an eye."
Go to the other side!
Get below!
Martin, Lacey, see if you can get some fire in there.
Is she dead?
She was guilty.
She was stained with the mark of sinners.
Shut upl
Come on, get her below, quick.
Mary.
Oh, what's the use of all this?
We can't beat them!
Let's just wait and die!
Oh...
What are you standing around for?
Did you think it would be a picnic?
Sergeant, take care of her.
What's it look like out there, Gibbons?
Put her over there.
Mama!
Talk to me, Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Mama.
Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
I wanna stay by Mama, please.
I know, baby, but it's gonna be all right.
You come with Lucy, huh?
I'll take care of you, I promise.
Everything's gonna be all right.
There's some things the army doesn't teach, aren't there?
Lucy, I...
I wish to apologise for the bad things I've said about you.
And the... worse things I've thought about you.
Forget it.
I...
Thank you.
How many casualties?
Two dead.
Quite a few nicks.
It could have been worse.
What happens now?
We wait until the medicine man says a prayer to decide when to attack.
How will we know?
It won't be any secret.
# Them golden slippers, gold
# Golden slippers I'm gonna wear because they look for me #
Conover, we need what rest we can get
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank!
They're sneaking up on us!
Hold it!
That's no attack.
They're coming to claim their dead.
Sergeant, when they've gone, send a detail to bury those renegades.
Right.
I'm sorry.
You did right.
How are you holding up?
Just tired.
This may sound strange after the way I acted, but when you're liable to be sleeping for a long while, you want as much living as you can in the time that's left.
You're a good soldier.
Get some rest.
Thanks.
Frank.
I want you to know, whatever happens, I've learned one thing - life is meant for only one thing, every minute of it.
To love and to be loved, that's all that counts.
Stella, listen...
- Please.
If we live, I'll tell my husband that what never started between us will never start
And then I'm going home.
And wait.
Jones, take over here.
You're on guard later.
Get some sleep.
Stop treating me like a child.
I treat you all the same.
Except Stella.
That's crazy.
No.
If you can fool a boy like Bax, if you can lie about me...
If you don't want to be treated like a child, don't act like one.
Scared, Ann?
We all are, you know.
It's not that.
Oh?
What, then?
The love bug bite you?
No!
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Oh, to be young and not know the source of your troubles.
He's a Yankee.
Yes, and he's a liar, too.
Hear, now.
If you love him, you help him.
He's got nothing but troubles.
Men, I want to talk to you.
He ought to be back in the army, always shouting, shouting orders.
His shouting doesn't fool me.
He's worrying himself sick for us.
Trying not to show it.
That's why he's shouting.
Good soldiers ought to know the truth
We can let them burn us out or carry the fight to them.
You're leaving it up to us?
Why?
You don't tell us how to nurse babies, so we don't tell you how to fight Comanches.
That's right.
What happened?
Him!
That medicine man.
I got so mad at him for asking his god about killing more of us, that I loaded up old Betsy with five times her...
Oh, look at her.
Five times?
Hannah, he's more than a mile away.
He is?
Guns work for 300 yards at best They keep the medicine man out of range.
I guess I figured I'd prove my god was more powerful than his.
Well, I guess I was just hoping for a miracle.
Let's see if we can fix up one.
Yeah, I...
Huh?
Let's go.
Sure you can hit these things?
We'll hit 'em.
Don't forget everything I told you.
It's up to you now.
I'm staying here.
Are you trying to get killed?
Obey orders.
All right, men.
Back to the fort.
That's enough.
What's holding you up, Martin?
Well, it's too bad to waste time until maybe there isn't any more.
Time for what?
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.
Or to apologise for the mean things I said without having enough sense to realise I'd regret them.
With any luck, I think we might have been friends.
Maybe more than that.
How does it look, Sergeant?
They look upset about something.
Good luck.
- Same to you.
Now, put your sights on them bombs and squeeze gently.
Frank is running away!
He's gone to do that miracle I tried with that old musket last night.
He's getting the medicine man.
Fire!
Did he make it?
Yes.
Go with the other children.
I'm the only man left to help fight.
No, Bax.
Do as I tell you.
No!
You got no right to say no after what I did.
Here's a gun.
Take that last window.
Guard that window!
We make a great team, Hetty.
Yes, ma'am, we sure do.
I'll get some more ammunition.
Hetty!
From now on, ma'am, you'll have to do your own hair and dressing.
And shooting, too.
Look!
You're making a mistake!
Look!
You're making a mistake!
You're killing the wrong ones!
Shut up!
Bax!
How are you?
Oh, Bax!
Cora, what are you doing?
Let go!
I'm gonna kill them!
Ammunition.
Go easy.
We only have a little left.
This thing is stuck.
Ammunition!
Ammunition!
Ammunition over here.
Drag him over to the front.
When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
There it is.
Give me a hand with this rope.
Open the doors!
That's good, give me some slack.
If superstitions run true to form then this ought to do it.
We whipped them!
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
You're a better man than I am!
Ann?
- Yes?
I have to go away for a while.
For how long, I don't know.
I go remembering that, with any luck, we might have been more than friends.
Then why go?
I'm still a deserter.
I don't want to spend my life running
Where's he going?
The defendant will step forward and face the court.
The court has weighed the evidence presented by the prosecution and defence.
The unanimous verdict...
Ten-shun!
At ease, gentlemen.
Don't let me interrupt, Colonel Chivington.
You're in charge.
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged with insubordination and desertion.
Where did you apprehend him?
He came back voluntarily but with a wild story of rallying a bunch of women in Texas and fighting off Indians.
That was no story.
The defendant will remain silent.
Yellow Horse and Broken Foot were brought in three days ago.
They did admit to being in a fight.
One they'll never forget.
With buffalo hunters, not some petticoat brigade.
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone!
What's all this?
We've come for the Lieutenant.
Stand easy.
This ain't no bugle.
Colonel, this is that phantom petticoat army.
I'd like you to meet Ogden, Conover, Sergeant Lacey, Melavan and Corporal Martin.
Incidentally, six of the best marksmen you ever saw.
Now we've been introduced, let's get out of here.
Hold it, Lacey.
Look, men, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but you'll get me hung.
Clear out before I drive you out.
Mr Colonel... if there's any driving to do, we'll do it.
Melavan, what's come over you?
The Lord told me that if something's worth fighting for, a body'd better fight.
Sergeant Lebbard, have the bugler sound assembly.
Can't we have a truce?
- That depends.
The South has counterattacked.
We've lost this engagement.
The reports I have received prove that the wrong man has been on trial
The evidence is overwhelming, and some of it downright attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, we will need you at the trial of Colonel Chivington for the Sand Creek massacre.
Stella took your advice and stayed behind to wait for her husband.
Lieutenant, thank you and God bless you.
That was for the slap, Frank.
I made a good trade.
Thanks again.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll never get used to you without gun smoke on your face.
You'd better try, renegade.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Nancy.
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy to be a real lady, to square things.
I think that'll square a lot of things.
Good luck.
And good luck to you, too.
Peace.
You are far from the reservation.
We carry no arms.
The treaty says you can't leave without permission.
No guns, no bows and arrows.
In the north, ranches were burned, people murdered.
We search for those who did this.
To the south we trade with our brothers.
In peace we return to our farms and women.
Next time, obey the treaty.
The Colonel will be disappointed to have nobody to shoot at.
Yeah.
Come in.
Lieutenant Hewitt is here, sir.
Send him in.
Lieutenant?
Welcome back, Hewitt.
Thank you, Captain.
What did you find?
We ran across a band of Cheyenne.
But not the renegades we want.
How do you know?
They came from the south.
They were unarmed.
But they were illegally off the reservation.
They said it was a trading mission.
"They said."
Have the bugler sound assembly.
Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do?
Teach them a lesson.
Double the ammunition ration.
Yes, sir.
You can't do that.
Don't forget yourself, Lieutenant.
Dismissed.
We don't attack friendly tribes.
I preserve treaties and keep the peace.
I said you were dismissed.
Every other tribe - the Paiute, the Comanche - will use it as an excuse to join the Cheyenne on the warpath.
Not with me here to stop them.
And south of here?
South?
Texas, sir.
The South's used all its manpower in the Confederate army.
We're fighting the South.
If putting Indians on the warpath helps us to win, I've no objection.
We're not fighting against women and children.
There's hardly any men left in Texas.
Your being from Texas wouldn't have anything to do with it?
A man fights for what he thinks is right.
You're being insubordinate.
And you're in the wrong colour uniform.
One of us is dressed wrong, Colonel.
Lieutenant, you're under arrest and confined to quarters until I return.
You fixed yourself up good, didn't you?
Did you hear what he said?
I got ears.
Well, remember it.
Lebbard?
Yes, sir?
See this gets to General Firewell.
What are you gonna do?
Somebody's got to warn the settlers.
You know what'll happen if you leave
I'll worry when the time comes.
You're just being plain crazy.
Charge!
Hey, ain't you misread your compass needle?
This is the Texas border.
I know.
Have you had any Indian trouble here?
This far south?
I'd like a canteen of water
What for?
Do you ask everyone the same thing?
Only if it's a Northern soldier trying to sneak into Texas as a spy.
I am from Texas.
In that uniform?
Better hold him.
Here, use these.
They were after guns and ammunition.
Don't go to sleep cos they'll be back.
Here.
Where are you going, mister?
You're still aiming to hold me?
Yeah.
Till you get what you were after.
Thanks.
It's all clear, Sheriff.
I sent for the doctor.
I'd better get you something to cover up that uniform till you get where you're going.
Try this.
I have got people to talk to.
I'd like to get close enough before they shoot.
Folks is sensitive to that colour around here.
Say, just exactly what are you?
I guess you could say I'm a deserter.
From which side?
Both, I suppose.
I'll get you that food and water.
Hey, Stellal
Stellal We've got company.
If he'll stay for dinner, can we have peaches?
Maybe.
Go back to the house.
Go on.
Mind me!
Hi, Stella.
I thought you'd gone for good.
So did I.
But you couldn't stay away.
No, Stella.
In fact, I deserted.
Well, you're late.
I'm married.
You're not the only man in the world
Wait a minute...
Wait?
Am I supposed to wait forever?
Let me tell you - one week after you left, I got married.
To a good man, too.
Ed Leathem.
That's his kid brother, Bax.
Two weeks ago there was a massacre of Cheyenne at Sand Creek.
My regiment did it.
Now the Indians are on their way.
Indians.
You made that up fast
Get off my land.
Stella, wait!
Your best chance is at the mission.
Damn Yankee!
Get her there, Bax.
Damn Yankee!
Hello, Miss Hannah.
Don't you recognise me?
Frank Hewitt.
I don't recognise no traitors.
The Comanches are on their way.
I figured you're the strongest woman of them all.
If you want to scare us off our land so you can claim it, you're stupid.
I only want to help.
You'd better listen.
Listen?
I've already listened to three husbands in my time.
Maybe I'll listen to three more.
Now, you listen.
Our menfolk are fighting your kind.
We don't want what you call help and I call lies.
Get going before you need patches on them blue breeches.
Don't you dare, you dirty renegade!
No more trouble out of you, now.
Who are you?
What's your name?
Ann Martin.
Are you Jeff Martin's girl?
Where's your pa?
He's dead.
You'd be dead too if he taught me how to shoot.
I'm not here to do you any harm.
Indians are on the warpath.
I want you to get to the mission as fast as you can.
I'm sorry about your pa.
Now, you start running.
Ann, your father and I were friends.
If you're pig-headed enough to stay here and get slaughtered, there's nothing I can do about it.
Keep moving, Yankee.
I was a horse's hindsight for ever coming here.
You get!
Mr Turncoat, I guess I didn't talk very clear last time.
Nor did I. So maybe this will help.
Dora Hartley.
The way the Comanches left her.
That's an ugly way of telling things
You wouldn't listen to me.
You had to be shown.
There are things to do.
Let's go.
Most merciful Father, who has been pleased to take unto Thyself the soul of this, thy servant, Dora Hartley, grant unto us, who are still in our pilgrimage, who walk as yet by faith,
that we may join Thy blessed saints hereafter in glory everlasting.
# Now all my money's spent and gone
# You pass by my door, a singer, a song
# Now all my money's spent and gone#
Good afternoon.
How do you do?
La-di-dah.
I thought all the real men were away fighting'.
Are you ladies from around here?
Certainly not.
I'm Mrs Charlotte Ogden of the Charleston Ogdens.
The first thing I wish to make clear is that I am not with this... this...
Er, creature?
Thank you.
Our driver left two days ago to find a new wagon when we broke down.
I thought I should bring 'em here.
You did right.
Put a wheel on this vehicle, and we shall be on our way.
That won't be possible.
We're expecting Indians.
Indians?
Men Indians?
You might as well alight.
Indians!
Indians!
Where's my rifle?
Get down over there!
You should have seen yourselves.
You, too, yellow-liv...
Stand easy, son.
What's wrong?
Can't take a joke?
Not when it isn't funny.
I thought you should hear the sound of the only Indian within 100 miles.
Or maybe you believe your tall tale.
If Dora Hartley could speak from the grave, she'd tell you.
She was killed by a stray.
What if you're wrong?
If he's right, we should run so fast the wind would knock over the trees.
By the time you ladies made up your minds, the Comanches could have closed off the valley.
Two days ago would've been different.
We're asking about today and tomorrow.
I say we stay here.
All of us.
How many ladies know how to shoot?
You can put your hand up.
I can shoot good, damn Yankee.
Mr Hewitt.
Only the Good Book tells me what is right to do.
I don't believe in killing.
Miss Cora, the Comanches won't be reading it through their rifle sights
Miss Hannah, I appoint you sergeant and second-in-command.
Pick a couple of corporals.
Ann Martin and Stella Leathem.
Good.
Now, get those horses unhitched and put them in the corral.
Get your things inside the mission.
I sure wish you troopers luck.
Cos you're sure gonna need it.
Going somewhere, Kettle?
Maybe you do need a man around here.
One you're sure is on your side.
At least I chose a side.
Let's get to work.
You heard the man.
Emmett, I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, Mary...
Yeah.
All right, men, use your muscles.
Turn it over.
In there.
Push.
Push!
All right, Lieutenant, all right.
Ready, men?
One, two, three...
Heave!
Any three men, Lieutenant.
Yeah, well.
Target practice.
Good.
Hold it, hold it.
Get your head down so you can see that front sight.
That's fine, Hetty.
Are you all right?
You won't hit anything, but you'll sure as blazes scare them to death.
If I remember correctly, you don't need much practice.
I'll take my gun back if you don't mind.
Better than any three men, Lieutenant, any three men.
Most any three men.
Hurry up, hurry up!
Prepare to move out, Sergeant.
Skirts!
Up!
Tuck them in!
Tuck them in!
Ready!
Charge!
You're supposed to be doing a skirmish, not dancing a polka.
Heckles, get down.
The back of your lap is a hard place to tie a bandage.
This time I want you to hit that ground so hard it splits wide open.
Oh.
General, this ain't the kinda work I'm accustomed to.
Can't you think of a more pleasing arrangement for the both of us?
Fall in!
On the double!
You've got to brace your feet, girls.
Next!
Hold it!
Hold it.
That's not the way I showed you.
Get over there, Martin.
You've got to use their momentum.
All right.
Fast.
You see?
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working all day long
# Passing the water, darling
# Pass the bucket down the line
# Pass the bucket down the line...
Start on that one over there.
If Indians don't attack at night, why can't we bring water in there?
Because they'll be needing water.
Sounds reasonable.
# Passing the water, darling
# We've been working all day long
# We've been working... #
It's no wonder.
We're not slaves.
You've no right to work us to death.
Hetty, my smelling salts.
Keep that water moving.
How dare you talk to me like that.
Move!
You'd better rest for a while.
Sit here.
You'll be all right.
Just a little touch of sun.
Emmett, you've got to help me.
Let's not start that again.
I can't stand it any longer.
I think I'm losing my mind.
You haven't told the others?
No, but it won't take long to guess.
Oh, Emmett, please marry me.
Look, I... told you.
I'm not ready for marriage yet.
Get inside or back behind the wall.
Behind the wall, men.
Now, get down.
Get down!
Let's get to work.
Throw all these pieces down the hole!
It's about ready.
There's a saying that an army travels on its stomach.
I'm glad we're not going anywhere.
More salt.
Don't waste that lead, it's scarce.
Don't reload these with rough edges.
What's wrong with your petticoat, Ogden?
We need bandages.
I had Hetty give up hers.
Take it off.
What?
Take it off right now.
How dare you?
Take it off, or I'll do it for you.
H-h-hetty?
If you were in South Carolina, sir, you would be horsewhipped.
Let me introduce a lady, la-di-dah.
La-di-dah, a lady with a very pompous air, la-di-dah.
# She can't see you pass her by Cos her nose is in the sky
# Her boots are fancy leather And her bonnet... #
We needed the petticoat.
La-di-dah.
Hi, Stell.
- Can I talk to you?
Sure.
What do you really think our chances are?
With Indians it's hard to tell.
I know what this can be.
Frank, I said I got married a week after you went away.
Ask me why.
You said Ed Leathem's a good man.
He is.
But ask me if I love him.
That's not a fit question.
I married him out of hurt and spite.
I don't blame you.
I went crazy at what you'd done.
Don't say something you'll regret later.
I'm so glad I can say it at last
In my heart I've never been his wife
When I saw you come riding in, it was like a dam bursting.
It let all my feelings loose.
Hey, Stella!
Stella!
What is it, Bax?
Sergeant Hannah needs you.
I'll be there in a minute.
She wants you right away.
I made that up to make her go.
Now, mister.
Careful where you point that gun.
I'm pointing it at a no-good Yankee.
Shouldn't we forget about the war?
My brother told me to look after her
You're doing a good job.
We were just talking about Ed.
Out here?
Like that?
Bax, can you keep a man's secret?
Depends.
You've got things mixed up.
See, I already have a girl.
Which one is she?
You'll find out
Which one?
Well...
There she is now.
Come back here!
Hello.
- Hello, Bax.
Ann Martin?
That's right.
She's nice.
Yeah.
You remember it's a secret.
Sure.
It's time you got to bed.
Good night.
Put that gun away.
Look, what makes him so sure that Indians are between us and safety?
Dora Hartley was pretty good proof.
Then why aren't we better off trying to fight our way through than waiting to be slaughtered like a bunch of sheep?
That's something to think about.
We can make it easy if we travel light.
Load everyone in a couple of wagons, stick two horses on behind, and when one team gives out, change over.
Simple?
Sergeant Lacey!
Sergeant Lacey!
The Lieutenant and Kettle - they're fighting.
What happened, Hewitt?
- Deserter.
And what are you?
Hewitt drove off all the horses.
Did you?
- Yes.
Why?
He was afraid we'd leave and tell where he was hiding.
I don't believe it.
It's partly true.
I heard Kettle trying to talk you into running away.
Sounded like you might.
So you made up our minds for us.
Somebody had to.
Without letting us decide for ourselves.
But he kept one horse for his own getaway.
That was for scouting.
Oh, sure.
A likely story.
Ha!
Fine thing to have to believe a turncoat.
Just a minute!
Frank stayed with the rest of us.
What about that varmint?
Lock him up till the fighting starts.
All right.
Get goin'!
Frank, look.
I'm afraid it's your place, Stella.
We can hope they head north.
But we'll be ready.
Right.
Back to your posts, men.
Move along.
Move along!
Sentry?
All clear, Lieutenant.
Keep your eyes open.
What you're trying to do for us now doesn't make up for the bad before.
What bad was that?
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you?
I have to live with my conscience.
And it makes you turn traitor against friends and neighbours?
You think your way, I'll think mine.
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.
I'm glad you two didn't bust up.
Bust up?
I've got the secret about you being his girl.
Bax, see if the horses are all right.
You told him I was your girl?
Yeah, I...
I had to.
Why?
He saw me with Stella and jumped to a conclusion.
Stella Leathem?
I'm glad I found out, too.
Oh, Ann.
Here's your water and candle.
Wait, Mary, please!
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I was wrong, so wrong.
No, I was wrong.
I guess maybe you were to have anything to do with me.
I should never have believed...
Listen to me, please.
Listen.
Before the war at the square dances, men were so thick around you, a fella couldn't get near without having his toes crushed.
Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.
I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.
What makes you remember now?
Being here, waiting to die.
We deserve to die!
I do, but not you and the b...
Oh, darling, we've got something to live for now.
Marriage?
Yes.
How?
No-one here can.
I know, darling, I know, but that horse will carry us to where there is one who can.
Oh, Emmett.
Could we?
Yes, darling.
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.
Oh...
The keys, darling.
Unlock the door.
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.
Conover and Gibbons, gardening time.
Your daughter ought to be in bed.
Come on, honey.
I wonder what it's like to have a kid.
One way to find out - marry and settle down.
Me?
New country, new life.
Why not?
Why not?
I knew a shoemaker once who became a violinist.
Hell.
There's a good girl!
Emmett?
Emmett!
Help me, please!
Come back!
Come back!
Mary, what happened?
Oh, Emmett!
Kettle escaped.
She tried to stop him
We'll take her.
No!
Help me, Cora.
No.
No.
You lied for her.
One question - why did you keep the horse here?
I could've led the Indians away before they spotted the place.
They'd have caught you.
Maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Amigo, set up three more.
Well, come on!
Make it fast.
These mornings are terribly dry.
Look, I'm no bartender.
I think you are.
We lost the other one.
Tortilla missed.
I do sometimes.
Thank you.
Amigo, how much money you got?
None, I haven't got any.
It's pretty low.
What are you gonna do?
Come over here.
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Put your arms up!
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!
We find out
Let me get down, will ya?
Get them up!
- He is a heavy one!
Let me get down!
Now, there.
Tell me, how much money you got?
None.
I told you, none.
Oh, amigo, I must shoot you for lying.
I'm not lying, I'm not.
I...
Look, my pockets are empty.
Search.
Then I'm gonna shoot you for not having no money!
No, look...
Will you tell your boys to stop this joke and cut me down?
My friend, we're in somewhat of a dilemma.
If you're lying, he has to shoot you.
If you have no money, he has to.
Now, what's it gonna be?
Look, supposing I... supposing I was to tell you where there was gold.
Where's that?
Cut me down.
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?
I couldn't.
There's a bunch of women there, afraid of an Indian attack.
They held me prisoner, I escaped.
They got jewels and gold there.
Women?
Supposing there is no gold?
There is!
There's still women.
And also Indians.
So long as we're in this valley, let's enjoy it.
Unless he lies and there is no women
I'm not lying!
Then we come back and complain.
Keep amigo here?
I'll wait.
Look, I want my share of the gold, too.
That's fair enough.
Are you sure you're not lying?
No.
About the gold?
No.
Or the women?
No, I...
No.
I'm afraid I really must, old boy.
Oh, no.
No!
Please!
N...
It's not good to have too many people know about a hoard of gold.
Or women.
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Mine's a bit lame.
Sergeant Hannah!
Sergeant Hannah!
Yes?
Indians!
Everybody to their posts!
Get the Lieutenant.
Hurry, Indians!
Is everybody at their posts?
Yes.
Well, get to yours.
They're not Indians.
Maybe we've got some help.
They're white men.
Well, open the door.
Well, welcome, men.
You heard, boys.
Looks like we're at the right place at the right time.
Correct.
You're just in time for a little Indian attack.
Indians?
That's a nasty word.
Don't josh.
It's no joke.
Glad you're here.
We could sure use three more guns.
Hey, where d'you get that horse?
Where's Kettle?
He sent us in his place.
That's right, amigo.
He say you need help here pretty bad.
Three for one.
That's...
We only interested in two things.
One's gold - where's it at?
What are you talking about?
Now, get!
These are women?
Get going, buster.
Frank!
You'd better take him inside.
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.
Them women can't get away with that!
Tonight'll be different.
Look!
Whoa!
Hyah!
Peace!
We don't mean no trouble.
No, no.
We like Indians.
One of you talk English?
- Me.
Tell your people we're friends.
Si, amigos.
My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.
It was not a fly.
We're poor men.
Honest
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...
Big, like a mountain.
- Gold only good for white man.
Amigo, maybe you interested in white women who brought the gold.
Ah, Chihuahua!
Beautiful, every one.
And a pony soldier.
Chivington.
Chivington's man.
Where?
The medicine man is a man of his word?
Yes?
No?
Where?
There.
Back there.
The mission.
You lie.
No, amigo.
To prove that we are honest, we will stay here and wait for you.
Si?
We are entitled to some of the gold.
You honest, you come with us.
They're headed toward us.
Back to your posts.
Wait.
We gotta gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.
Roof?
Move!
Hurry up!
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!
Leave them open!
Go up!
No-one moves or talks.
One call could decide whether we stay alive or not.
Where people?
Well, they gotta be there.
We seen them, didn't we?
Yeah.
The Lord is my strength, my rock...
No women, no water.
But they got to be.
They were all around.
We talked to them.
That's right.
They couldn't have just flew away.
Chief!
I know...
They're going away.
We're safe.
I knew if I prayed there would be no killing.
It didn't do those three any good.
Let's get below.
We sure fooled them.
Frank, what have I done?
Coulda happened to anyone.
Get to your posts.
Bax, look after the children.
You can shoot, get over there.
That's an order.
You will obey if I have to drag you over there.
What are they doing?
He's gonna tell them if the signs are in their favour.
Mother of Moses, you can't get any scareder than I am right now.
Let them come into the yard before you shoot.
Don't waste any bullets.
Now!
Get them.
Get down!
It doesn't matter.
It does.
Hold your fire!
Martin, get those outposts in.
Why weren't you firing that piece?
The Lord was plain in His commands about violence and bloodshed.
He also said "An eye for an eye."
Go to the other side!
Get below!
Martin, Lacey, see if you can get some fire in there.
Is she dead?
She was guilty.
She was stained with the mark of sinners.
Shut upl
Come on, get her below, quick.
Mary.
Oh, what's the use of all this?
We can't beat them!
Let's just wait and die!
Oh...
What are you standing around for?
Did you think it would be a picnic?
Sergeant, take care of her.
What's it look like out there, Gibbons?
Put her over there.
Mama!
Talk to me, Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Mama.
Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
I wanna stay by Mama, please.
I know, baby, but it's gonna be all right.
You come with Lucy, huh?
I'll take care of you, I promise.
Everything's gonna be all right.
There's some things the army doesn't teach, aren't there?
Lucy, I...
I wish to apologise for the bad things I've said about you.
And the... worse things I've thought about you.
Forget it.
I...
Thank you.
How many casualties?
Two dead.
Quite a few nicks.
It could have been worse.
What happens now?
We wait until the medicine man says a prayer to decide when to attack.
How will we know?
It won't be any secret.
# Them golden slippers, gold
# Golden slippers I'm gonna wear because they look for me #
Conover, we need what rest we can get
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank!
They're sneaking up on us!
Hold it!
That's no attack.
They're coming to claim their dead.
Sergeant, when they've gone, send a detail to bury those renegades.
Right.
I'm sorry.
You did right.
How are you holding up?
Just tired.
This may sound strange after the way I acted, but when you're liable to be sleeping for a long while, you want as much living as you can in the time that's left.
You're a good soldier.
Get some rest.
Thanks.
Frank.
I want you to know, whatever happens, I've learned one thing - life is meant for only one thing, every minute of it.
To love and to be loved, that's all that counts.
Stella, listen...
- Please.
If we live, I'll tell my husband that what never started between us will never start
And then I'm going home.
And wait.
Jones, take over here.
You're on guard later.
Get some sleep.
Stop treating me like a child.
I treat you all the same.
Except Stella.
That's crazy.
No.
If you can fool a boy like Bax, if you can lie about me...
If you don't want to be treated like a child, don't act like one.
Scared, Ann?
We all are, you know.
It's not that.
Oh?
What, then?
The love bug bite you?
No!
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Oh, to be young and not know the source of your troubles.
He's a Yankee.
Yes, and he's a liar, too.
Hear, now.
If you love him, you help him.
He's got nothing but troubles.
Men, I want to talk to you.
He ought to be back in the army, always shouting, shouting orders.
His shouting doesn't fool me.
He's worrying himself sick for us.
Trying not to show it.
That's why he's shouting.
Good soldiers ought to know the truth
We can let them burn us out or carry the fight to them.
You're leaving it up to us?
Why?
You don't tell us how to nurse babies, so we don't tell you how to fight Comanches.
That's right.
What happened?
Him!
That medicine man.
I got so mad at him for asking his god about killing more of us, that I loaded up old Betsy with five times her...
Oh, look at her.
Five times?
Hannah, he's more than a mile away.
He is?
Guns work for 300 yards at best They keep the medicine man out of range.
I guess I figured I'd prove my god was more powerful than his.
Well, I guess I was just hoping for a miracle.
Let's see if we can fix up one.
Yeah, I...
Huh?
Let's go.
Sure you can hit these things?
We'll hit 'em.
Don't forget everything I told you.
It's up to you now.
I'm staying here.
Are you trying to get killed?
Obey orders.
All right, men.
Back to the fort.
That's enough.
What's holding you up, Martin?
Well, it's too bad to waste time until maybe there isn't any more.
Time for what?
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.
Or to apologise for the mean things I said without having enough sense to realise I'd regret them.
With any luck, I think we might have been friends.
Maybe more than that.
How does it look, Sergeant?
They look upset about something.
Good luck.
- Same to you.
Now, put your sights on them bombs and squeeze gently.
Frank is running away!
He's gone to do that miracle I tried with that old musket last night.
He's getting the medicine man.
Fire!
Did he make it?
Yes.
Go with the other children.
I'm the only man left to help fight.
No, Bax.
Do as I tell you.
No!
You got no right to say no after what I did.
Here's a gun.
Take that last window.
Guard that window!
We make a great team, Hetty.
Yes, ma'am, we sure do.
I'll get some more ammunition.
Hetty!
From now on, ma'am, you'll have to do your own hair and dressing.
And shooting, too.
Look!
You're making a mistake!
Look!
You're making a mistake!
You're killing the wrong ones!
Shut up!
Bax!
How are you?
Oh, Bax!
Cora, what are you doing?
Let go!
I'm gonna kill them!
Ammunition.
Go easy.
We only have a little left.
This thing is stuck.
Ammunition!
Ammunition!
Ammunition over here.
Drag him over to the front.
When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
There it is.
Give me a hand with this rope.
Open the doors!
That's good, give me some slack.
If superstitions run true to form then this ought to do it.
We whipped them!
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
You're a better man than I am!
Ann?
- Yes?
I have to go away for a while.
For how long, I don't know.
I go remembering that, with any luck, we might have been more than friends.
Then why go?
I'm still a deserter.
I don't want to spend my life running
Where's he going?
The defendant will step forward and face the court.
The court has weighed the evidence presented by the prosecution and defence.
The unanimous verdict...
Ten-shun!
At ease, gentlemen.
Don't let me interrupt, Colonel Chivington.
You're in charge.
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged with insubordination and desertion.
Where did you apprehend him?
He came back voluntarily but with a wild story of rallying a bunch of women in Texas and fighting off Indians.
That was no story.
The defendant will remain silent.
Yellow Horse and Broken Foot were brought in three days ago.
They did admit to being in a fight.
One they'll never forget.
With buffalo hunters, not some petticoat brigade.
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone!
What's all this?
We've come for the Lieutenant.
Stand easy.
This ain't no bugle.
Colonel, this is that phantom petticoat army.
I'd like you to meet Ogden, Conover, Sergeant Lacey, Melavan and Corporal Martin.
Incidentally, six of the best marksmen you ever saw.
Now we've been introduced, let's get out of here.
Hold it, Lacey.
Look, men, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but you'll get me hung.
Clear out before I drive you out.
Mr Colonel... if there's any driving to do, we'll do it.
Melavan, what's come over you?
The Lord told me that if something's worth fighting for, a body'd better fight.
Sergeant Lebbard, have the bugler sound assembly.
Can't we have a truce?
- That depends.
The South has counterattacked.
We've lost this engagement.
The reports I have received prove that the wrong man has been on trial
The evidence is overwhelming, and some of it downright attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, we will need you at the trial of Colonel Chivington for the Sand Creek massacre.
Stella took your advice and stayed behind to wait for her husband.
Lieutenant, thank you and God bless you.
That was for the slap, Frank.
I made a good trade.
Thanks again.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll never get used to you without gun smoke on your face.
You'd better try, renegade.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Nancy.
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy to be a real lady, to square things.
I think that'll square a lot of things.
Good luck.
And good luck to you, too.

EDWARD R. MURROW:
This is the result of panic, the blind unreasoning terror of men who run and do not truly know what they are fleeing.
And this is the factual story of such a panic.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Good evening.
I'm Ed Murrow and this is the story of "The Night America
Trembled." it was October 30, 1938, a night weather like other October nights in other years except for perhaps two factors.
First, it was a year in which the nations of the world, at peace for almost 20 years, had recently seen shattered their comfortable illusion of security.
2,000 miles away, across an ocean now realized to be no longer a safeguard against invasion, the arrogant demands of a power hungry dictator had short weeks before forced haughty Britain and proud
France to agree to the humiliating peace of Munich.
Thus, point one.
But world events had left men shaken and unsure.
Hence, open to emotional attack against their reason, against their intelligence, and their logic.
Point two is somewhat harder to accept, but it's equally valid.
It can be traced back countless centuries beyond civilized mankind's reasoned fear of war to primitive man's instinctive terror of the great unknown.
For October 30 was that mysterious night when dark tradition tells us fiends and demons walked the whims of the world.
The one night of the year when even sensible men believe that almost anything can happen, the eve of Halloween, 1938.
And in a radio studio of the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City, the actors and staff of the Mercury Theatre on the air were putting the final touches to what was frankly a terror tale, which was to go on the air within a few short minutes.
We see them now in the final moments of rehearsal with their director.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Jason.
Hey, fellas, hold it will ya please?
Hold it down over there.
Thanks.
Jason, page 19, that hissing humming sound,
I'd like you to mix in the hum a little bit faster, and build it more than you did in the past.
Can you do it?
-OK, I'll do it.
-OK, let's try it.
Philips?
-19?
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I got it.
-Pick it up about here.
-Mm-hmm.
Yeah, the-- the captain and two policemen advanced with something in their hands.
Yes, I can see it now.
It's a white handkerchief tied to a pole, a flag of truce.
If those creatures know what that means, what anything means, no, wait, wait, something's happening.
A humped shape is rising out of the pit.
I can make a small beam of light against a mirror.
What's that?
There's a jet of flames springing from that mirror, and it leaped right at the advancing men.
It strikes them head on.
Good Lord, they're turning to flames!
-OK, nice job.
That's perfect, do it just like that.
-Well, that oughtta scare the daylights out of 'em.
It does me, and I've been rehearsing it for hours.
-You never can tell.
Radio listeners are pretty blase nowadays.
Bill?
-Yes Sir.
-The sequence where you're calling all stations, the CQ call.
-Page 28?
-Yeah.
Now build that a shade more.
You think you're the last man alive on earth.
So let's have a little more desperation, huh?
-I don't wanna ham it up.
-Well, this is pure fantasy.
Play with all the stops out, OK?
-OK.
I'll do that.
-15 mi-- 15 minutes?
-Right.
-OK.
All right, everybody take 10.
Positions at 7:55.
-In October of 1938, the Columbia Broadcasting System
Radio Network consisted of 110 affiliated stations in 44 states.
There was practically no sizable community in America which could not be reached by CBS broadcast.
Thus, from Maine to California and from Canada to the Gulf, listeners were tuned to the Mercury Theatre on that fateful night In the eastern United States, the area closest to the scene of fictitious peril, reaction
was most vivid and violent.
However, it should be remembered that in their behavior, these Easterners we're not unique.
Everywhere emotions and reactions were the same.
Panic struck universally out of the dark but peaceful sky on a night that began quietly enough.

Stand by everybody.
-The Columbia Broadcasting System, and its affiliates, present the Mercury Theatre on the air in "War of The Worlds"
by H.G. Wells.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Ladies and gentlemen, the host of the Mercury Theatre.
-We know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own.
We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps, almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
-Any action, Mike?
-Not a thing.
You get the coffee?
-Yeah.
-You said black, didn't ya?
-Yeah, that's right.
-That's yours then.
-Thanks.

-Does he think they're all stolen cars?
He calls in about 20 a night.
-That's what you call an obsession.
-He reads too much Dick Tracy.
-Well, that could be.
PD1 calling 154.

POLICE OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Got it.
Thanks Mac.
-Right.
A real eager beaver.
-Well, you gotta have somebody like him to keep you awake on a night like this.
-Yeah, I suppose.
Sunday nights are usually pretty dull after Labor Day.
-Pretty dull?
You know, I took this job because I thought it was going to be exciting.
-On this particular evening, October 30, the Crossley rating service estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios.
-For the next 24 hours not much changed in temperature.
A slight atmospheric disturbance of undetermined origin is reported over Nova Scotia causing a low pressure area to move down rather rapidly over the Northeastern states bringing a forecast of rain accompanied by winds of light gale force, maximum temperature 66, minimum 48.
This weather report comes to you from the Government Weather
Bureau.
We now take you to the Meridian Room in the Hotel Park Plaza in downtown New York where you will be entrained by the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Good evening ladies and gentlemen, from the Meridian Room in the Park Plaza in New York City, we bring in the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.

-A column, a column and a half maybe.
-Build it to two columns.
I got a good picture here and a double column spot on the front page.
-OK, but there's not really much to it, no serious injuries.
-Yeah.
We could use a good lead story.
All I've got is a community fund report.
That's the trouble on Sunday nights, nothing ever happens.
-That's right, that's the trouble with Sunday nights in the news business.
Nothing ever happens.
These people are comfortable, relaxed, you might say even bovine in their smug complacency.
It's a Sunday night like other Sunday nights, quiet, uneventful.
America is at peace.
There's no threat of war.
They have no way of dreaming that within a few short minutes, their complacency is to be rudely shattered by an actor's voice speaking lines from a play.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program, of dance music to bring you a special bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio News.
-The opening words, the words that shook the nation.
PHILLIPS:
At 20 minutes before 8 central time,
Professor Farrell of the Mount Jennings Observatory, Chicago,
Illinois reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars.
The spectroscope indicates the gas to be hydrogen and moving toward the earth with enormous velocity.
Professor Pearson of the observatory at Princeton confirms Farrell's observation and describes the phenomenon as quote, "Like a jet of blue flame shot from a gun."
We now return you to the music of Ramon Raquello playing for you in the Meridian Room of the Park Plaza
Hotel situated in downtown New York.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-One troubled face out of 10.
But this is the face of dawning panic on the night America trembled.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-The night America trembled.
We are bringing you the true story of the most memorable dramatic broadcast in the history of radio.
The Mercury Theatre's unforgettable dramatization of war of the worlds.
The broadcast had just begun.
Its effect is not yet beginning to make itself felt in the cities and hamlets of a nation soon to be caught in the grip of ungovernable terror.

-Planet Mars?
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Due to the unusual nature of this occurence, we have arranged an interview with a noted astronomer, Professor Pearson, who will give us his views on the subject.
In a few moment's, we will take you to the Princeton
Observatory at Princeton, New Jersey.
We return you, until then, to the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.
-I wonder what that's all about.
-Who cares?
Will you turn that off?
-Turn it off?
-I'm studying.
-You wanna study, go up to your own room.
-I'm the gregarious type OK?

Look at those stars, they look so close.
You feel like you can just reach right up and touch them.
-Sure, you can.
Do you want a handful?
-You're crazy.
-Crazy about you.
Mary?
-Mm-hmm?
-I got something for you today.
-What?
-This.
-Bob!
-Well, how 'bout it?
-What will my parents say?
-Oh, you know what they'll say.
They'll say we're too young, too immature.
But they've been saying that for a year.
What do you say?
Shall we?
Tonight, right now.
We--
-I-- I'd like to, Bob, but--
-What's the matter?
Aren't you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.
-Well then-- oh, Mary, I-
- I know a Justice of the Peace and we could be there in an hour.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Ladies and gentleman, a special announcement from Trenton,
New Jersey.
It is reported that at 8:50 PM, a huge flaming object believed to be a meteorite, fell on a farm in the neighborhood of Grovers Mill, New Jersey 22 miles from Trenton.
The flash in the sky was visible within a radius of several hundred miles.
And the noise of the impact was heard as far north as Elizabeth.
We have dispatched a special mobile unit to the scene and will have our commentator, Mr. Phillips, give you a word description as soon as he reach there from Princeton.
In the meantime, we take you to Hotel Marinet in Brooklyn where Bobby Millette and his orchestra are offering a program of dance music.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-That must be what we saw.
-No, couldn't be.
New Jersy's 500 miles north.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
RADIO BROADCASTER:
We take you now to Grovers Mill.
PHILLIPS
- HOST (ON RADIO):
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Carl Phillips again at the Wilmot farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey.
Professor Pearson and myself may be 11 miles from Princeton in just 10 minutes.
Well, I-
- I hardly know where to begin to paint for you a word picture of the strange scene before my eyes.
I guess that's the-- the thing directly in front of me, huh, buried in a vast pit.
Must have struck with terrific force.
The-- the ground is covered with splinters of a tree it must have struck on the way down.
What I can see of the object itself doesn't look very much like a meteor, at least not like the meteors I've seen.
It looks, well, it looks more like a huge cylinder.
The color is sort of yellowish white.
Curious spectators now are pressing close to the object in spite of the efforts of the police to keep them back.
One man wants to touch the thing.
He's having an argument with the policeman.
And The policeman wins.
No-- now ladies and gentlemen, there's something I haven't mentioned in all this excitement, but it's becoming more distinct.
Perhaps you've caught it already on your radio.
Listen.
[SOUND EFFECTS OF WARPED MUSIC]
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
Do you hear it?
It's a-- it's a curious humming sound that seems to come from inside the object.
I'll move the microphone closer.
Here we are.
Now we're not more than, oh, 25 feet away.
Can you hear it now?
[STRANGE SOUND EFFECTS]
[PHONE RINGS]
-Hello?
Oh, hello, Molly.
No, no, I'm just ah-- waiting here for-- for Paul and his wife.
We're going to church.
The radio?
No I haven't, why?
What?
Well, just for a minute, perhaps.
Thanks Molly.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
The thing is smooth and as you can see of cylindrical shape.
Just a minute.
Just a minute, something's happening.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is terrific.
This end of the thing is beginning to flake off.
The top is beginning to rotate like-- like a screw.
The thing must be hollow.
-Hey, she-- she's a movin'.
-Look, the darn thing's unscrewin'.
-Keep back there, keep back I tell ya.
-Hey, hey, maybe there's men in it tryin' to escape.
-It's red hot.
They'll burn to a cinder.
-Keep back there, keep those idiots back.
-She's off.
The top's loose.
-Look out there.
-Stand back.
-Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I have ever witnessed.
Wa-
- Wait a minute, someone's crawling out of the hollow top, someone or-- or some thing I can see peering out of that black hole two luminous discs.
Are they eyes?
I-- it might be a face.
It might be-- good heavens, something's wriggling out of the shadows like a gray snake.
Now it's another, and another.
They look like tentacles to me.
There, I can see the thing's body.
It's-- it's-- it's as large as a bear and it glistens like wet leather.
The face, it's indescribable.
I can hardly force myself to keep looking at it.
The eyes are black.
-I'm going to turn this thing off.
-Oh, no.
-It's makin' me nervous.
-No Bob.
Listen.
Listen.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
Saliva dripping from it's
-OK.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
Riffleless lips that seem to quiver and pulsate.
The monster, or whatever it is, can hardly move.
It seems weighted down by, well, by possibly--
-Oh, it's horrible.
[PHONE RINGS]
-Times World.
City desk.
A what?
Wait a minute.
Hey, Johnny you got anything on the wire about a meteor falling in New Jersey?
No, ma'am, we haven't got anything on it.
Nothing at all.
No ma'am.
Don't mention it.
What do you suppose is ailing her?
-Why, what's up?
-She said she heard something on the radio about a meteor landing in New Jersey carrying Martian monsters.
Boy, people.
-So the Mercury Theatre on the air blithely proceed with its dramatization of H.G. Wells
"War Of The Worlds."
The actors, of course, have no way of knowing their performance is sowing the seeds of panic amongst hundreds of thousands who believe they're actually hearing a facto report.
But others are beginning to feel it's impact.
For instance, the officers on duty at the state police and fire dispatchers office in Trenton, New Jersey.
[PHONE RINGS]
-State Police.
No Sir, we don't know anything about that.
Sir, there is no Grovers Mill in New Jersey.
There's a Groves Mill, but there's no Grovers Mill.
I can't help it, Sir, what the radio says.
There's no such place.
[PHONE RINGS]
-State Police.
No ma'am we don't know anything about that.
Well, I can't help that ma'am.
We just don't know anything about it.
Well, did I say somethin' about a quiet Sunday evening?
-Well, what's goin' on anyway?
[PHONE RINGS]
-I don't know.
They say it's been announced on the radio.
You better check.
State Police.
[PHONE RINGS]
-No Sir, we have no information on that, sorry.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
We are bringing you an eye witness account of what's happening on the Wilmot farm, Grover's mill, New Jersey.
Meanwhile a counter interlude.
-That must be it.
-What the hell's he talking about Grovers Mill?
There's no such place.
-Maybe it's just a play or somethin'.
RADIO BROADCASTER (ON RADIO):
We now return you to Carl Phillips at Grovers Mill.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
Ladies and gentleman, ah-- am I on?
Ladies and gentlemen, here I am back of a stone wall that adjoins Mr. Wilmot's garden.
Form here, I get a sweep of the whole scene.
[PHONE RINGS]
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
I'll give you every detail as long as I can talk, as long as can see.
More state police have arrived.
-More state police?
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
They're drawing up a course just in front of the pit.
-State Police.
No, Sire, we have no information on that yet.
We're checking it now.
-All right, just wait'll next year, you'll see.
-Oh, next year, next year, always next year.
The Dodger's ain't won a pennant since 1920.
-And you're sayin' they ain't never gonna win another, eh?
-Probably.
-Boy, I wish I knew all the answers like you do, you know.
-Oh, come on, you guys.
Why you two always arguing'?
-Mike, have you heard?
-Head what?
-About the Martians, a spaceship full of Martians landed near Trenton 50 miles from here.
It's on the radio now.
-Martians?
-Well, that's what the guy said.
-What guy?
-Well, some guy on the radio, some professor from Princeton.
The state cops are out there now.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
The captain and two policemen advance with something in their hands.
Yes, I can see it now.
It's a white handkerchief tied to a pole, a flag of truce.
It those creatures know what that means, what-- what anything means.
Wait, wait, something's happening.
A humped shape is rising out of the pit.
I can make out a small beam of light against a mirror.
What's that?
There's a jet, a flame springing from that mirror and it leaps right at the advancing men.
It strikes them head on.
Good Lord, they're turning into flames.
Now the whole field's caught fire.
The woods, the barns, the gas tanks of automobiles, it's spreading everywhere.
It's coming this way about 20 yards to my right.
-Ladies and gentleman, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grovers Mill.
Evidently there is some difficulty with our field transmission.
However, we will return you to that spot at the earliest opportunity.
-Well, come on.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
In the meantime--
-Come on, we gotta get down there fast.
I gotta a car.
-Down where?
-Down to Grovers Mill.
-Well, where's Grovers Mill?
-Somewhere near Trenton, I think.
-Oh, now, wait a minute fellas.
We don't know what this is all about.
-Who don't know.
It's like I told ya.
It's the Nazis.
-But the guy on the radio said it was monsters from Mars.
-It's Nazi air raids.
Come on, come on.
We gotta get down there.
-Hey, you guys, wait for me.

RADIO BROADCASTER:
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been handed a message that came from Grovers Mill by telephone.
Ah-- just a moment.
-Who's deal?
Speak up.
What's the matter?
Isn't anybody interested in poker anymore?
-Todd, this is important, listen.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
At least 40 people, including six state troopers, lie dead in a field east of Grovers Mill.
Their bodies burned and distorted beyond all possible recognition.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next voice you hear will be that of Brigadier General Montgomery Smith,
Commander of the state militia at Trenton, New Jersey.
-Trenton?
That's where my family lives.
-Listen, listen.
-I have been requested by the governor of New Jersey to place the counties of Mercer and Middlesex as far west as Princeton and East to Jamesburg under martial law.
Four companies of state militia are proceeding from Trenton to Grovers Mill and will aid in the evacuation of homes within the range of military operations.
Thank you.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
You have just listening to General Montgomery Smith.
-Charlie, you hear that?
They're calling out the Army.
-And my folks, I-

-Take is easy, Buzz.
They're all right.
-What do you know?
I'm gonna call them.

We have been unable to establish any contact with our mobile unit at Grover Mill.
But we hope to be able to return you there at the earliest possible moment.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
Something moving, solid metal, kind of a shield like affair rising up out of the cylinder.
It's standing on legs actually rearing up on a sort of metal framework.
Now it's reaching above the trees and the search lights are on it.
Hold on.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make.
Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our own eyes lead to the inescapable assumption that these strange beings that landed in New Jersey farmlands tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars.
-Mars?
-Bob, Bob, turn around, go back, go back.
Bob!
Bob!
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.

The impact of the Mercury Theatre's broadcast of H.G.
Wells "War Of The Worlds" is as devastating as it is unexpected.
The Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations, the newspapers, the police and fire departments of the whole nation all are being deluged by a Niagara of calls from frenzied listeners who believe the radio drama to be the real thing.
More than a million listeners from Coast to Coast are caught in the grip of a contagious mass hysteria.
And they flee in terror from an incredible bogeymen, mythical invaders from the planet Mars.

We've got to get out of here Mr. Chandler.

RADIO BROADCASTER:
I'm speaking from the roof of the broadcasting building, New York City.
Bells you hear are ringing to warn people to evacuate the city as the Martians approach.
Estimate that in last two hours 3 million people have moved out along the roads to the North.
Hutchinson River Parkway still kept open for motor traffic.
Avoid bridges to Long Island, hopelessly jammed.
All communication with Jersey Shore closed 10 minutes ago.
No more defenses, our Army wiped, Artillery,
Air Force, everything wiped out.
This may be the last broadcast.
We'll stay here 'till the end.
-Paul.
Oh, Paul.
-Mother.
-Oh, Paul, Jane.
It's the end of the world.
We're all going to die.
I just heard it on the radio.
-Give me me a ticket, anywhere, as far as this will take me.
And hurry, the Martians are coming.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Black smoke drifting over the city.
People in the streets see it now.
They're running towards the East River, thousands of them dropping in like rats.
Now the smoke's spreading faster.
It's reached Times Square.
They're falling like flies.
Now the smoke is crossing Sixth Avenue.
[DOOR BUZZER]
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Fifth Avenue.
It's 100 yards away.
50 feet.
-Millie, what on earth's the matter with you?
-The baby.
-The monsters.
The monster's are going to kill us.
-Now, monsters, what are you talking about?
-The radio.
-The radio?
-Dead.
The announcer must be dead.

Isn't there anyone on the air?
Isn't there anyone?
2X 2L.
-It's just a radio play, Sir.
The whole city must have gone nuts.
-You mean the whole nation, the AP says the same thing's happening everywhere.
-Well, this is the lead story I wanted, and I can't even find time to remake the front page.
[PHONE RINGS]
-When is this ever gonna end?
It's just a radio play, ma'am.
-No ma'am.
There is no invasion.
It's just a radio play.
-BROWING:
Engine Company 5 and Chemical 5 to Somerset and Lord.
-Hey, hey, wh-- where's Grovers Mills?
-What?
-We come to volunteer.
-Volunteer?
-Yeah, the Nazi war planes, where'd they land?
-No its' the Martians.
-Fellas, fellas, there are no Martians, there are no Nazis.
It's just a radio play.
Now go home.
-A radio play?
[PHONE RINGS]
-That's all, now beat it.
Get outta here.
-But Chief, it was clearly announced as a play.
Here's a publicity released in tonight's paper.
Now listen, when the Mercury Theatre on the air broadcasts over the Columbia network at 8:00 PM, they will do H.G. Wells "War Of The Worlds."
This is one of the first shows about Martians.
It tells how the octopus like creatures from Mars lay waste the earth until there are only a few humans left.
Yes, that's absolutely right, every paper.
We-- well, how clear can you make a thing?
All they had to do is check.
Nobody in his right mind would believe it.
RADIO SHOW FEMALE:
He can give her Rudy Vallee for three days.
I'm gettin' hungry.
RADIO SHOW FEMALE:
Hungry?
RADIO SHOW MALE:
Hungry?
RADIO SHOW FEMALE:
Well, I'm the one that's hungry.
I tell ya, darling, I'm so staved, I could almost ah--
RADIO SHOW FEMALE:
Don't look at me that way.
No.
I'm just skin and bones.
MARY:
Mama.
Mama!
-Mary, what's the matter?
-What's going on here.
-It was a meteor, Sir.
-No, no, it's the Martians.
They're coming.
Haven't you heard?
They're destroying the world.
-Martians?
What are you talking about?
-It's on the radio.
-Well, we've been listening to the radio ever since y6ou left.
We haven't heard anything about it.
-Well, I don't get it.
It oughtta be on every station in the world.
-Turn to CBS.
PHILLIPS HOST (ON RADIO):
This is your host, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to assure you that "The War Of The Worlds" has no further significance than as the holiday offering it was intended to be.
The Mercury Theatre's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying, boo!
.
Starting now, we couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the next best thing.
We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed the Columbia Broadcasting System.
Now, you will be relieved, I hope, to learn that we didn't mean it and that both institutions are still open for business.
So, good bye everybody, and remember please, for the next day or so, the terrible lesson you learned tonight.
That grinning, glowing, globular invader of your living room is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch.
And ah-- if your doorbell rings and nobody's there, that was no Martian, it's Halloween.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Of all the--
-Why didn't you check the other stations?
-Well, we didn't have time, Sir.
We were too busy listening.
-You mean you really believed it?
Oh, you kids have got a lot to learn.
-Yeah, I guess you're right.
-It's all right, Millie.
It's all over now.
-Are you-- are you sure, Mrs. Chandler?
-Yes, Millie.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
RADIO BROADCASTER:
This is CBS, the Columbia
Broadcasting System.
For the listeners who tuned in to the Mercury Theatre on the air broadcast tonight and did not realize that the program was merely a radio adaptation of H.
G. Wells famous novel, "The War Of The Worlds"
we are repeating the fact, made clear four times on the program, that the entire content of the play was entirely fictitious.
-But I-
- I don't understand.
-Well, it was just a radio play, Millie.
-I just can't believe it.
It was so real.
-Ah, yes, it was so real.
So real that i completely fooled poor Millie and more than a million others who slowly came to their senses and realized they've been panicked by a colossal Halloween joke.
And what were their reactions?
Well, many laughed, with perhaps just a touch of historical relief in their laughter.
-Me scared?
Course not.
I knew it was a play all the time.
Sure me and the old woman was runnin' down the streets, mingled with the crowds, but we wasn't scared ourselves, just for the kicks.
Se how the others was takin' it.
You know what I mean.
-Others were somewhat indignant.
-A fine trick the play on people.
My-- my sister passed out.
All the kids were screaming their heads off.
The whole house was in an uproar.
Is that what you call entertainment?
-And still others we're furiously angry.
-Hello CBS?
Say, what are you gonna do about me?
I'm 300 miles from home without a penny in my pocket.
Where am I calling from?
Buffalo, New York, that's where I'm calling from.
And it's all your fault.
-So the reactions of the period.
But there is one thing we must not overlook.
All this took place in 1938 in a less sophisticated yesteryear that did not know the atom bomb guided missiles and rockets that may shortly fly to the moon.
20 years ago, the concept of an alien race was novel to us, hence.
Alarming.
Today we realize that Mars is very near, closer perhaps in time than we imagined.
There is every reason to believe that long before the Martians come to us, we will go to them.
I wonder if we'll panic them as they did us on the night America trembled.

[MUSIC PLAYING]
Thank you.
Oh, did you include the paragraph on the cost of the drilling rig?
And the estimates of the well in case it has to go deeper than 5,000 feet?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
You wanna see if this covers it, Miss Howard?
Thank you.
I think this ought to be a very profitable investment for both of us, Miss Howard, and I hope--
[DOOR CLOSES]
Now, remember, this is the last time you come here.
Well, all right, Bruce.
If that's the way you feel, I'll stay out of your way.
I just wanted to make sure we had everything down in black and white.
Roxy.
- Change your mind?
Ha-ha.
- I ought to kill you.
Do you see the model house, Mr. Mason?
Yes.
Well, now look at the swimming pool.
Now do you see the girl?
- Quite a bit of her, as a matter of fact.
- That's Roxy Howard.
She go with the model house?
No, Mr. Mason.
She goes with my husband.
You come up here quite often, Mrs. Granger?
I guess you think it's wrong of me spying on them like this.
No, not wrong.
Just very cruel to yourself.
I thought so too at first.
I never knew that hate had a taste all of its own that kind of fills your throat and chokes you.
But it doesn't get you back the man you love.
Mr. Mason, that's why I asked you to come up here.
Plainly because I thought if you saw what I was fighting that maybe you'd take my case.
There are any number of good divorce lawyers.
I don't want a divorce.
I want Bruce.
Oh, Mr. Mason, he's worth fighting for.
You just can't give up 15 years of married life, of love and companionship, of being part of another person, just because one of you makes a silly mistake.
You're a very unusual woman.
No, just a woman who wants her husband.
What would you like me to do?
Do you see all this property, Mr. Mason?
Well, all this property belongs to the Sylvan Glade Development Company.
- Did they put up the model home?
- Yes, but that's as far as they'll go.
They think they found oil on the property now.
What's all this got to do with Miss Howard?
Well, the Sylvan Glade Company didn't have enough money to drill so Miss Howard persuaded my husband to finance the operation.
And if they find oil on the property, she gets half his profits.
Not bad.
- She own that model home?
- No, they're just letting her live in it.
I understand she has a very good friend in the company.
- Any idea who this friend is?
- No.
Apparently Miss Howard has thought of everything.
Not quite.
Not if I can get you to block the deal.
How do you expect me to do that?
By buying stock in the Sylvan Glade Company.
Oh, I'll put up the money.
But once you're a stockholder, you'll find a way.
You believe that if Miss Howard can't realise a fast profit on your husband, the romance will sour.
That's right and then she'll play the part of the nagging wife.
And when she does, I'll be there waiting with laughter and companionship.
And I'll be playing the part of the other woman.
What if your husband finds out?
Oh, but he mustn't find out.
That would ruin everything.
That's why I want you to do this all in your name.
Well, Mr. Mason?
- I'll do everything I can to help.
- Oh, thank you.
But buying that stock could prove very expensive.
I'll get the money for it somehow.
Where's your son-in-law, Lutts?
We wanna start the meeting.
Oh, Herbert.
Will you come on out here so we can get down to business?
Sorry.
I was just getting the minutes in order.
Well, now, before Herbert reads the minutes of our Sylvan Glade Development Company,
I have a couple of announcements to make.
I've asked Mr. Granger and Miss Howard to attend this meeting so we can close the oil deal that we have with them.
We also have another guest, Mr. Perry Mason.
What's he doing here?
Mr. Mason has bought some of my stock in the corporation.
Wait a minute, he's a lawyer, isn't he?
LUTTS:
That's right.
- Who are you representing?
The stock is in my name.
Well, you're representing somebody.
You didn't just drop out of thin air.
Oh, Sam Elkins.
For once, let's have a meeting without all the fuss and feathers.
We've got important business here.
Business that means money in all our pockets.
Now, Mr. Granger here is prepared to finance our drilling operations as soon as we've passed a corporate resolution to exploit the oil and mineral rights of our county property.
- We have agreed that, in exchange--
- Uh, Mr. Chairman.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
I'm confused.
I was under the impression you were going to subdivide that county property for tract houses.
I don't care what your impression was.
We're here to talk money, not impressions, and oil is money.
And how do we know there really is oil?
MASON:
Most speculative.
- How many shares does he have?
- Let's vote him out of the room.
I move we proceed at once to exploit the mineral and oil rights of our tract number 136.
Wait, before you vote, better have a look at your corporate bylaws, Paragraph 2, Section 16.
"It will be binding upon this corporation to secure the unanimous consent of all stockholders before undertaking any activity not specifically identified with the construction of home dwelling units and the acquisition of property therefore."
I am unalterably opposed to the business now before this board.
Good day, gentlemen.
Can he do this to us?
How much did he pay you for those shares?
- Why, that's none of your business.
- It's all of our business.
If you hadn't let him buy in, this wouldn't have happened.
Well, they're my shares I can do what I like with them.
Suppose there is no oil?
I've got to protect myself.
- And sell us down the river, is that it?
ELKINS:
Yes.
- Maybe you and Mason--
- Where do you think you're going?
Isn't it obvious?
The deal's off.
Oh, no, it isn't.
They'll figure something out.
As far as we're concerned, the deal is still on unless you want me to do business with your wife.
Listen to me, Mr. Mason.
I need that stock.
I've got to get it back.
I'll give you $36,000--
Hello?
Mr. Mason.
Hello?
Hello?
He won't even listen to me.
He can make 10 percent on his investment in one day and he won't even listen to me.
Papa, don't get so excited.
It's bad for you.
Come on, eat your dinner before it gets cold.
What does the man want?
What's he trying to do to me?
Oh, so you had to buy steak at $1.34 a pound.
What's the matter with you?
You think I'm made of money?
- Oh, please.
- Isn't it enough that I feed you and your husband, and clothe you, let you live in my house rent-free?
Do you have to bleed me dry?
Vinnie didn't mean any harm, George.
Oh, you keep out of this.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't understand.
Everybody tries to take advantage of me.
You, Elkins, Mason.
Did Mason say why he wouldn't sell the stock back to you?
Oh, some nonsense about wanting to keep the property clear for development.
Ha.
But, Herbert, you're always out there, fixing up that model house.
You ever seen Mason hanging around?
- No, not that I remember.
-Ever see anybody?
What about Mrs. Granger, Herbert?
Sybil Granger?
Bruce Granger's wife?
- It's nothing.
Forget it.
- What do you mean forget it?
- Did you see her there or didn't you?
- Yeah.
Every day last week, wasn't it?
- Oh, Vinnie, please.
- But you told me.
Papa, she's up there every afternoon on the hilltop in back of the model house.
She watches it with binoculars.
- The house?
- Mm-hm.
Well, there's nothing to see at the house--
Wait a minute.
We're letting Roxy Howard live at the house.
And Bruce Granger's been paying her a lot of attention.
He's up there too, Papa.
Herbert has seen him.
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I didn't think it was important.
- My hind foot.
- Papa, your dinner.
Keep it warm.
Vinnie, I wish you hadn't said anything about this.
Why not?
At least it got his mind off the steak.
Hello, Sam?
George Lutts.
No, no.
I haven't got the stock back yet, but I will.
Now, listen.
You have bank connections.
Find out if Mason deposited a cheque from Mrs. Bruce Granger.
That's right.
Mrs. Bruce Granger.
She's behind all our troubles.
Enjoying the view?
Oh, there's no need to be scared, ma'am.
I'm George Lutts.
My company owns all this property.
How do you do?
You interested in acquiring a piece of land?
- No, no.
I'm just looking around.
- Hmm.
Mind if I look?
Sometimes there's an awfully good view from up here.
Mm, no, nothing much to see today.
Maybe tomorrow, though.
Mr. Lutts, why did you come up here?
It certainly wasn't by accident.
Let me put it this way, ma'am.
It's just as accidental as Mr. Mason's buying stock in my company.
The way I see it, he bought those shares for you.
I want them back.
Or else I'll tell your husband that you've been spying on him.
And also that you--
[GUNSHOT]
Mr. Lutts.
[ENGINE SPUTTERING]
Taxi.
Help me!
- Where to, miss?
- Just drive on.
I'll tell you where later.
"Question:
Mr. Mason.
'What happened after your car went into the ditch?
'
Answer:
Mrs. Granger. 'I was petrified.
I didn't know which way to turn.
I just wanted to get away from there as fast as I could.
I ran down to the highway.
I was lucky enough to find this cab."'
I don't know how lucky that is.
The driver's sure to remember you.
Did you keep your taxi receipt?
Uh...
Yes, I think I did.
The Skyline Cab Company.
Trip number 971, $2.95.
I gave the driver a 55-cent tip.
Do you own a gun?
Yes.
My husband collects them and he gave me one.
Where is it?
You don't think I shot Mr. Lutts?
Where is that gun now?
It's in my car.
Let's get it.
I left it in the glove compartment.
But I thought I left it there.
If you pick someone to lie to, Mrs. Granger, never choose your doctor or your lawyer.
In both cases, it could be fatal.
Now, I've got to call the police.
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
Yes, Paul.
Good.
What about the cab?
All right, I'll be there in about an hour.
- Well, that's half the battle.
- Did your man get my car?
- It's in your garage.
- Oh, thank heaven.
Now, what about that friend of yours, Ruth, uh--?
- Ruth Marvel.
- Is she ready?
She's waiting in her apartment.
- Sure you can trust her?
- Of course.
With your life?
- Yes.
- All right, then.
- You know what you're to do?
- Certainly.
- Hello, Drake.
PAUL:
Come in, partner.
We're heading south on Roxbury.
The cab is in the left lane.
Stay with him.
Frank, don't lose him if he turns on Santa Monica.
That's a bad intersection.
If that cab turns west, it could be trouble.
FRANK:
No, he's going east.
- Mrs. Granger ready?
- Any time you are.
The cab's stopping.
Our man's getting in.
Good.
Stay with him.
- Hello, Mrs. Granger.
- Yes, Mr. Mason.
One of our men just got into that cab.
He'll have the driver take him to an address about half a block away from where you are now.
- I understand.
- He'll be coming north on Doheny.
Now, hang on, I'll keep you posted.
FRANK:
Passing Hillcrest.
Still on Santa Monica.
He's turning left on Doheny now, on his way north to Sunset.
Hello, Mrs. Granger.
Get ready.
He's coming towards you now.
Cab 761.
Should be there any minute.
- He'll drop a passenger off.
- Hold on.
Ruth, that taxi should be here any minute.
- What number?
- Seven sixty-one.
- I see him.
- We see him.
Fine.
That's your man.
Now, get that cab and don't forget the receipt.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Where to, miss?
Well, we're looking for a place in Beverly Hills.
I don't know the exact address.
You just drive down Sunset.
We'll tell you where to let us out.
No matter what you do, Mrs. Granger, hold on to this taxi receipt.
I want the police to find it right off the bat.
I understand.
[INTERCOM BUZZES]
Excuse me.
- Yes, Della?
- I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Mason, but Lieutenant Tragg is getting impatient.
Oh, of course.
Send him right in.
- Shall I--?
- Sit right over there.
MASON:
Good morning, lieutenant.
- You mean good afternoon.
I feel like I've been waiting all day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's on your mind?
As if you had no idea.
What do you know about George Lutts?
- Lutts?
Oh, yes, Lutts.
- Remember him?
You called and told me where I'd find his body.
- So I did.
- Yeah.
There was a gun nearby.
- What can you tell me about it?
- Not a thing.
It was registered in the name of Bruce Granger.
Well, I imagine you've talked with him.
For several hours.
He was very vague.
Couldn't remember when he'd last seen it.
- So naturally, we figured, uh-- S YBIL:
You're wrong.
Bruce gave it to me.
It was my gun.
- This is Mrs. Granger.
- I see.
You mustn't blame my husband, lieutenant.
It was my gun.
Well, I think you'd best discuss this with the district attorney.
But I didn't kill Mr. Lutts.
Then you haven't a thing to worry about.
The State of California v. Sybil Granger.
Your Honour, this present case is perfectly simple and straightforward.
And if we can avoid endless and purposeless cross-examination, this preliminary hearing can be quickly resolved.
Do you wish to make any statement, Mr. Mason?
None whatever, Your Honour.
Proceed.
I will call Lieutenant Tragg.
Now, lieutenant, were you present when the defendant was arrested?
- I was.
- Was she searched at that time?
Yes, by a police matron, though I went through her purse myself.
- What did you find in her purse?
- Well, the usual things.
Keys, money, cigarettes and a taxi receipt from the Skyline Cab Company.
Is this the receipt?
- Yes, sir.
- How can you be sure?
You'll notice I wrote my initials in the corner and the date.
If the court please, I should like this marked for exhibit.
Now, lieutenant, I notice this is dated May 3rd.
- What was the date of the murder?
- May 3rd.
- The same day?
- Same day.
- Were you present at the scene?
- Yes, sir.
And did you examine the body
- of the victim yourself?
- I did.
How far would you say the gun was held from the victim at the time the fatal shot was fired?
Well, between, um, 18, 20 inches.
Certainly under two feet.
How do you determine that?
Well, by the powder tattooing on the skin and the dispersion of powder particles in the clothing.
Thank you, sir.
You may cross-examine.
Why did you tell me that shot came from a distance?
It did.
Do you intend to cross-examine this witness, Mr. Mason?
No questions, Your Honour.
Call Jerome Keddie.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- State your name.
- Jerome Keddie.
- Be seated.
Could you tell us your occupation, Mr. Keddie?
I'm a driver for the Skyline Cab Company.
On the third day of this month, were you operating taxicab number 761 ?
I was.
And where were you at about 4:45 on the afternoon of that day?
Well, I was running back empty towards the city from out near the new freeway area on the county highway.
A woman flagged me down.
She sure was nervous and upset.
I ask you to look around this courtroom and tell us if that woman is here.
There she is.
BURGER:
Let the record show that the witness pointed to the defendant,
Sybil Granger.
Now, Mr. Keddie.
Where did you take Mrs. Granger?
To the Brent Building in Los Angeles.
I'm gonna show you a piece of paper marked Exhibit A and ask if you can identify this.
- Yes, it's the receipt I gave her.
- What does the receipt show?
It shows the trip number, that it was my cab
- and that the fare is $2.95.
- Thank you.
Your witness.
Now, Mr. Keddie.
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, it's one of my trip sheets.
Would you mind explaining what that means?
Well, we have to keep a record of all of the fares we pick up.
- Police orders.
- Thank you.
I'd like this marked for exhibit, Your Honour.
Mr. Keddie, this trip sheet is dated the 3rd of May.
- Is that correct?
- That's right.
This passenger you picked up on the highway, the one you claim was the defendant, that was one of your first trips of the day?
Oh, it was the third.
Number 971.
It's right here on the sheet.
I see.
How does it happen, then, that this receipt, the receipt you gave the defendant, is for trip number 984?
- What?
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let me see that thing.
- Now let me have the receipt.
- Just a moment.
The court would like to look at those papers too, Mr. Prosecutor.
I'm sorry, Your Honour, of course.
Well, Mr. Keddie, I notice that trip number 984 on your sheet is one which you have marked the destination to be Whittier and Wilshire.
Oh, I remember that trip.
A couple of ladies I picked up on Sunset.
They wanted to go to a certain place in Beverly Hills, only they didn't know the address.
So I drove them around until, all of a sudden, one of them says:
"Stop right here.
Here it is."
So I stopped.
They got out and paid off.
Was one of those women this defendant?
Well, you know how it is.
You pick up a lot of people.
I can't remember them too well.
The point is, Mr. Keddie, can you swear that the woman you picked up on Sunset wasn't the defendant?
No.
I can't swear it.
That's what I wanted to know.
Mr. Prosecutor, you must admit that the testimony of this witness has become hopelessly impaired.
You would hardly be in a position to put him in front of a jury to make an absolute identification.
At the moment, I'm more interested in learning how this trap was set.
And I intend to find out.
Meantime, I'd like the defendant bound over, indicted on a charge of murder in the first degree.
Well, not unless you have additional evidence.
The testimony of this witness has been destroyed.
All right, Your Honour, then I move that this hearing be dismissed while I get additional evidence.
Motion is granted.
Court is adjourned.
Did you notice?
He left a vapour trail.
He'll be back with a warrant inside of five minutes.
I didn't fool him one little bit.
- Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Granger?
- I didn't.
You told me that shot came from a distance.
- The officer must've made a mistake.
- No, not Tragg.
If he said there were powder burns, why, there were powder--
Well, speak of the devil.
Congratulations, Mason.
A brilliant performance.
Oh, it's just that the opposition wasn't up to par.
Oh, really?
I thought Burger did all right.
Now, I ask you, Tragg.
He charged my client with murder and never established one link between her and the victim.
He's shown no actual proof that Lutts and Mrs. Granger even met.
Well, you've got a point there.
You mind if I think that over for a minute?
You know what you're really thinking about, don't you, Tragg?
How you can delay us until Burger shows up with his warrant.
What--?
Whatever gave you that impression?
Well, for one thing, that deputy coming toward us right now.
What...?
Oh, you mean this.
Matron, Mrs. Granger is being held for another hearing.
Well, see you later, counsellor.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Granger.
You'll have to go with the matron.
GRANGER:
Sybil.
Please, my husband.
I'm sorry.
I must go now.
I'm Bruce Granger.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Aren't you a little late, Mr. Granger?
Come on, Della.
This is the spot, Perry.
See Della?
This is the only place in a direct line with the hilltop that isn't obscured.
- How do we get in here?
- Lutts' son-in-law might have a key.
Let's try him.
Those are all the keys my father-in-law had.
That was a Master padlock on that shack, Perry.
- None of these keys will fit.
- I'm sorry.
If there's nothing else we can do for you...
As a matter of fact, there is.
Did your father-in-law have any enemies?
It's all right, Herbert.
George Lutts wasn't the easiest man in the world to get along with.
Not everyone liked him.
- Did you?
- Ha-ha.
- Now, you listen to me.
- Never mind, Vinnie.
No, I'm gonna tell this smart lawyer a thing or two.
Do you think Herbert enjoyed working for my father?
He had better offers every day of the week.
You know why he stuck?
To please me.
- I see.
VINNIE:
No, I don't think you do.
How could you, Mr. Mason?
You didn't have a father who was sick.
Sick about money.
Who was twisted every which way whenever he had to spend a nickel.
But he was my father and Herbert stayed with him to please me.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Dean.
Come on, Della.
Excuse me.
[SOBBING]
You've been under a strain, Vinnie.
It won't last much longer.
Why, lieutenant, I'm surprised at you.
- A Peeping Tom, at your age.
- Ha.
Beautiful pair of glasses.
Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?
Uh-huh.
One of my men found them in a ditch.
Not far from where Lutts was shot.
Notice the initials there.
- These belong to Sybil Granger.
- Uh-huh.
And Mason said that we couldn't prove that she even knew George Lutts.
Don't tell me the lab found Lutts' fingerprints on these.
Oh, but all over.
I wonder how Mr. Mason will explain that at the next hearing.
Mr. Redfield, let me understand you.
You say that this exhibit is the defendant's gun, that it has her fingerprints on it and it was found near the victim's body.
Yes, sir, and it was registered in the name of Bruce Granger.
- Had it been fired?
- Yes, sir, twice.
One of the cartridges was a Peters .38
Special.
The other one was a U.M.C. That was the last one fired.
Now, as ballistics expert for this department, you checked the fatal bullet to determine from which weapon it had been fired.
Isn't that correct?
I did.
It was fired from that gun.
The one you're holding.
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Mr. Redfield, you stated there were two shots fired from the murder weapon.
- Yes.
- Which one was the fatal bullet?
The first one.
The Peters .38
Special.
Well, what happened to the bullet from the second shot, the U.M.C.?
We were unable to find that bullet.
It went wild.
You want us to believe that the defendant stood less than two feet away from the victim, hit him with the first shot and completely missed him with the second?
I'm here to report the facts as I find them.
You can interpret them any way you want.
All right, let's interpret them my way, if you don't mind.
Now, suppose the first bullet, the bullet that killed Lutts, was fired from a distance.
Then you'd have no powder burns on the body.
Suppose the second shot was a blank.
- A blank?
- Yes, if it were fired directly into the wound, say, from a distance of, oh, 19 inches, wouldn't that explain the powder burns?
That would explain the powder burns, Mr. Mason, but we could establish what happened in a second.
Oh?
How?
A blank cartridge has a paper wadding to hold the powder in place.
The coroner would find it in the wound.
- And none was found in the body.
- None at all.
Now, you've got to understand that a paper wadding has a tremendous penetrating force.
It can go through thick cardboard.
Then it should certainly penetrate fabric.
Without question.
Very interesting.
If it please the court, I should like to test Mr. Redfield's thesis.
Your Honour, does counsel for the defence presume to know more about ballistics than Mr. Redfield, a recognised expert?
I see no harm in this experiment, Mr. Burger.
As I understand it, it is solely for the purpose of clarifying your witness's testimony.
Surely you can't object to that.
Proceed, Mr. Mason.
Now, Mr. Redfield, would you tell the court what this is, please.
- Yes?
- It's a blank.
Well, would it fit this gun, the murder weapon?
It should.
It's a .38.
Would you load it for me, please?
Thank you.
Now, Mr. Redfield, if I were to--
Oh, excuse me.
If I were to fire this blank into this fabric, what would happen?
You'd have your powder burns, but you'd also have a hole in the fabric.
- Caused by the paper wadding?
- Yes, sir.
All right, let's see.
Your Honour, I object.
Counsel for defence is up to his usual grandstanding.
I demand to know how that trick was accomplished.
Overruled.
It is not incumbent on Mr. Mason to reveal how this trick was managed.
Obviously, it wasn't done with mirrors.
[LAUGHING]
Have you any further questions of this witness?
No, Your Honour.
The witness is excused.
All right, sir.
My next witness is a hostile witness.
I have her under subpoena and I would like to call her at this time, out of order, for reasons which I shall show later.
Very well, you may call the witness.
Mrs. Ruth Marvel.
Now, keep a poker face.
They'll all be watching.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- State your name.
- Mrs. Ruth Marvel.
- Be seated, please.
Now, Mrs. Marvel, you know the defendant in this case, don't you?
I do.
She's my friend.
You might even go farther than that, couldn't you, Mrs. Marvel?
She's my best friend.
But you've just sworn to tell the truth, and I'm sure you will, won't you?
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Marvel, I'm gonna ask you if the defendant made a statement to you as to the reason, the real reason, why she wanted to engage a certain taxi on the night of May 3rd.
Objection, Your Honour.
Counsel is cross-examining his own witness.
He's asking leading questions.
He's threatening her--
May I be heard?
If the court please, I believe this witness will testify to a damaging admission on the part of the defendant.
The objection will be overruled.
All right, Mrs. Marvel, answer the question.
She said it was a cab she had taken earlier in the day.
She said--
She said what, Mrs. Marvel?
BURGER:
I must insist on your answer.
She said her lawyer had told her to take this cab, to have me ride around with her and pay him off when the meter got to $2.95.
Would you recognise that cab driver if you saw him again?
- Yes.
- Will Jerome Keddie stand up?
Is that the man, Mrs. Marvel?
Yes.
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
You mustn't feel badly, Mrs. Marvel, because the prosecution called you to testify.
The defendant told you that under my instruction, she was testing the recollection of a possible witness, didn't she?
That's right.
Now, the cab driver did not recognise her, did he?
At least, he showed no sign of recognition that you could see?
No, sir.
That's all the defendant was trying to accomplish.
We were simply attempting to test the credibility of a witness.
Now, that's all.
Thank you.
No further questions, Your Honour.
Very well, the court is adjourned until tomorrow morning.
Over here, Perry.
I thought you'd better see this for yourself.
These tracks were made by Roxy Howard's car.
My man saw her do it.
Also, the lock's gone now.
What the devil?
Paul, let me get this straight.
Your man saw Roxy Howard take a lot of junk out of here and toss it into the gully in back of her place?
That's right.
He made a complete inventory.
There were some small sandbags, a few clamps, some pieces of iron pipe, 2-by-4s and, oh, yeah, a stool.
- Where's the gully?
- Come on.
He showed me everything before he left.
Come on, Perry.
Wait a minute.
The stuff's gone.
It was right here.
- Who'd take it?
- I don't know.
Paul, I'm gonna take a last-minute gamble.
Get hold of your operative.
Have him describe every pipe and wood that he saw.
Duplicate it and bring it to my workshop tonight.
Oh, and don't forget the sandbags.
- No good to ask you why.
- No good.
Thank you very much, sir.
That completes the prosecution's case, Your Honour.
The defence may proceed.
I call as my first witness Bruce Granger.
BAILIFF:
Bruce Granger to the stand.
MASON:
Mr. Granger, what is your relationship with the defendant?
I'm her husband.
- How long have you been married?
- Fifteen years.
And, of course, you're very devoted to your wife?
- I mean, you naturally wanna help her.
- Of course.
Of course.
Tell me.
Do you know a Miss Roxy Howard?
Yes.
And what is your relationship with Miss Howard?
Well, we were friends.
Then, as a friend, have you ever been to Miss Howard's home?
- Yes.
- Then you know it's a completely isolated house in the Sylvan Glade Development.
- Yes.
- Well, for her personal protection, did you ever give Miss Howard lessons in shooting a revolver?
- Yes.
- You own a collection of firearms?
- Well, I have seven.
- They are all in your possession?
Except for the one that's being held by the police.
I see.
Did you ever give Miss Howard a revolver from your collection?
Answer the question, please.
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
- Does she still have the weapon?
- No, she returned it to me.
Oh?
- When?
- May 30th.
- What did you do with the weapon?
- I put it back in my collection.
Do you, uh, have any record showing the serial numbers of your various guns?
Yes.
Mr. Granger, where do you keep your gun collection?
In a locked wall compartment concealed behind a sliding panel.
And I have the only key.
[WHEELS SQUEAKING]
What is this?
I must beg the indulgence of the court.
But as part of my case, it is necessary for me to introduce in evidence some material discarded by one of the--
It's very heavy material and this is the only way I could bring it into court.
This is a disturbance we cannot tolerate.
You should have waited until the court takes a recess.
- You there, with that truck.
- Yes, Your Honour.
Wait there until counsel has finished the examination of this witness.
Then the court will take a brief recess.
It seems to me, Mr. Mason, that you could have secured a more silent truck.
Proceed.
If the court permit, I wish this witness be instructed to check his list of serial numbers with the guns now in his possession.
And after the recess, I want him to produce that list.
The witness is so instructed.
Perhaps we can also use the time to move that truck.
The court will recess until 11:30.
Did you have to make me use this old truck?
- I felt like a jackass.
- It was in a good cause, Paul.
Nothing like a little noise to upset jittery nerves.
If anyone on our list leaves the courtroom, he'll be covered.
- He'll be in a hurry.
- Will you please tell me what we're trying to do?
We are laying a trap for a nervous accomplice.
HO YT:
The court will come to order.
Mr. Bruce Granger to the stand.
- What is it?
- We just filled an inside straight.
Mr. Granger, you've checked your list of serial numbers with the guns in your possession?
Yes, and there's something I can't understand.
One of the guns isn't mine.
No, it's the same make and model, but it has a different serial number.
Could that weapon have been the gun
Miss Howard returned to you on May 30th?
- It could have been.
- That's all.
That's all, Your Honour.
HO YT:
Cross-examination?
Not at this time, Your Honour.
I might want to recall him later, if I may do that.
I have no objection in the least.
Will Miss Roxy Howard come forward, please?
BAILIFF:
Miss Roxy Howard.
Come forward and be sworn.
Now, Miss Howard, we've established that Mr. Granger loaned you a gun.
Did you ever give that gun to someone else?
- No.
- But Mr. Granger testified that the gun you returned to him on May 30th
- was not the same gun he loaned you.
- I can't help that.
Well, is Mr. Granger lying, or was there a substitution?
- I don't know.
- You don't know.
But you do know there's a construction shack near your home in the Sylvan Glade Development.
- Yes.
- Have you been inside that shack?
Once or twice.
Did you ever notice any unusual equipment?
Equipment that had nothing to do with the building construction.
I don't know what you mean.
With the court's permission.
[WHEELS SQUEAKING]
Miss Howard, you ever seen this before?
If Your Honour please, what possible connection can there be between that--
Whatever it is.
--and the murder of George Lutts?
This enquiry's getting pretty far afield.
If Your Honour please, this is exactly the field we should be in and I can prove it.
Proceed.
Miss Howard.
Have you ever seen that before?
No.
Perhaps you saw it in a different condition.
Taken apart, just pipes and wood.
I'm not sure.
Do you know what a shooting stand is?
- No.
- Mr. Granger never showed you one?
I tell you, I don't know what it is.
Then you've never seen any kind of a device that would steady the aim of a marksman.
- No.
- Well, such a device must be absolutely immovable, consequently heavy.
In this case, braced by sandbags.
The person using the gun merely lays his arm in the rest, holds the barrel on a direct line with the target, then all he has to do is simply pull the trigger.
[GUN CLICKS]
Do you still say you've never seen this before?
- Well, I--
- Have you seen it, Miss Howard?
- Yes.
- Where?
Didn't you see a shooting stand in that construction shack?
- Yes.
- What was the proposed target?
It had to be someone or some object on the hilltop.
The hilltop is the only place in a direct line with a certain hole in the wall of that construction shack.
Isn't that true, Miss Howard?
I don't know.
There were only two people on that hilltop.
George Lutts and Sybil Granger.
You knew that, didn't you?
I didn't know Mr. Lutts would be there.
But you were certain Mrs. Granger would be.
- Oh, well, she always was.
- I see.
Now, Miss Howard, let's jump a step.
Why did you take that shooting stand apart
- and dump the pieces in a gully?
- I didn't.
But you were seen, Miss Howard.
Where do you think this came from?
Now, I ask you again, Miss Howard.
Why did you take that shooting stand apart?
You must have had some reason.
Did you do it to protect yourself?
- No.
- Then who were you protecting?
No one.
Did you tell someone you had dismantled the stand?
- No.
- Then why were the pieces
- removed from the gully?
- You did that.
Oh, no, Miss Howard.
Someone else did that.
What you see here is purely for the purpose of demonstration.
The actual dismantled stand is in a garage not very far away from here.
Uh...
I don't know what you're talking about.
During the recess, the owner of that garage even ran home to make sure the stand was there.
He wanted to see if I was bluffing.
Well, it was there.
But he had no opportunity to warn you that I built that stand myself.
All right, Miss Howard, let's get down to cases.
Mr. Granger gave you a gun.
The weapon used to murder George Lutts.
You returned a different gun.
You knew Mrs. Granger was going to be on that hilltop.
You took a shooting stand apart, destroying evidence.
If you are not trying to protect someone,
- then you murdered George Lutts.
- No, no.
I didn't.
Uh...
It was an accident.
It was Mrs. Granger.
She was supposed to be the one.
You mean, you deliberately aimed at Mrs. Granger and Lutts got in the way?
No, I didn't say that.
- I didn't shoot Mr. Lutts.
- Then who did?
What are you sitting there for, letting me take the blame?
Come up here, tell them.
He did it.
Herbert.
Herbert Dean.
It was his idea.
He wanted to get rid of Mrs. Granger.
She was the only one blocking the oil deal.
Vinnie, wait, please.
You don't believe her?
Let go of me.
Bailiff, hold that man.
I would have made a million dollars.
He did it.
It was all his idea.
"And again, let me thank you for all you've done on behalf of my wife.
By the time you receive this, we'll be on our way to Mexico for our second honeymoon." It's signed Bruce Granger.
- Mm-hm.
- Women.
I'll never understand them.
Here, she takes the guy back after she almost gets herself killed because of him.
Oh, you're wrong, Paul.
Lutts was the target from the start.
With that shooting stand, Herbert couldn't miss.
Yeah, but Roxy said that--
Oh, Herbert let Roxy think he'd made a mistake so she'd keep on helping him.
[WHEELS SQUEAKING]
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
- What is the idea of this?
- We don't want it.
It belongs to Mr. Mason.
He introduced it in evidence.
And what are we supposed to do with this pile of junk?
- You take it right out of here.
- Hold it, hold it.
It's Mr. Mason's job to dispose of things like this.
I don't have to tell you, counsellor, you're gonna have quite a problem.
The city rubbish collection has strict orders not to pick up trash like this.
Now, I want to be reasonable, Perry.
I can handle the whole thing.
For a fee.
- Oh, that's bribery, Tragg.
- Uh-huh.
But the DA is a friend of mine.
He's not gonna give me any trouble.
You'd like to know how I worked that stunt with the blank cartridge.
That's my price.
Well, if instead of using paper wadding to hold the powder in the blank cartridge, you take some chalk, crimp just enough of it in the end of the shell to let the pressure build up, you'll burn up the powder--
And the explosion will disintegrate the chalk so there's no trace of it.
Oh...
Get me out of here before I use this on myself.
[LAUGHING]
Are you sure you gave Mr. Davenport the right address?
Positive.
Well, he's 15 minutes late now, Mr. Beckmeyer.
- If he is not here by--
- He'll be here.
Do you know the circumstances under which this food was prepared?
When you're a private detective, doc, you don't ask questions.
You figure your client wants you to know, he'll tell you.
What did you find in--?
[KNOCKS]
Come in.
Mr. Davenport, this is Dr. Mitchell.
- How do you do?
- Sorry, I'm late.
Won't you sit down?
Must be bad news if you don't think I can take it standing.
- Well, you see--
- What did you find in there?
Arsenic.
I thought she'd be a little more original.
But then arsenic worked for her before, so why change, right?
I don't think I follow you, Mr. Davenport.
Who you talking about?
My wife.
- Where's my wife?
- Well, she--
- Myrna, Myrna!
- Oh, what's wrong, Ed?
Mind your own business, Louise.
- Myrna!
MYRNA:
Coming, dear.
- Ed, you know what the doctor said.
- Yeah, we all know.
Packed your bag.
Don't drive too fast.
You can still make Bakerstown before--
You hypocrite.
Telling me not to drink, to listen to the doctor.
I don't know what you mean.
Those sandwiches you packed for my trip last week, they were loaded with arsenic.
Ed, what are you trying to do to her?
You're a fool, Louise.
Ask your precious cousin about Uncle Charlie.
Didn't you think something was wrong when he died?
Here, read it for yourself.
You poisoned him and now you're trying to get rid of me.
- Please.
- There's a letter in my office.
It's to the police, telling how you've been trying to kill me.
If I die, you'll go right after me.
Straight to the gas chamber.
Remember that.
MYRNA:
Ed.
[SOBBING]
[GRUNTS]
Hello?
- Hello?
WOMAN:
Yes, sir?
This is Mr. Davenport in Cabin 6.
Who's the nearest doc around here?
Dr. Renault.
He's just around the corner.
Well, get him over here right away.
I'm sick.
[GROANS]
ED:
Come in.
[RINGING]
Hello.
This is Dr. Frank Renault.
I'd like to talk to Mrs. Edward Davenport, please.
Well, she's, um-
- She's not in.
Is there any message?
Can you get in touch with her?
Her husband is very ill.
Are you related to Mrs. Davenport?
Yes.
Yes, I'm her cousin.
Well, frankly, madam, the situation is critical.
He's in an oxygen tent right now.
Hello?
I'm here, doctor.
He's in the Vista Motel on San Fernando Road.
- Cabin 6.
- We'll--
Uh, we'll be there right away.
Thank you so much for calling.
Goodbye.
Garden Club.
Arrangements Committee again.
Oh.
I thought it might be Ed.
Ohh.
When are you going to start thinking about yourself?
What kind of a husband is it who writes letters accusing his wife of poisoning him?
I don't believe Ed did that.
I think he was just talking.
Was he?
I bet he has it all written down.
It might even include his notion you killed Uncle Charles.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I tell you, Myrna, you've got to protect yourself.
For your own good, you ought to see a lawyer.
Do it just to please me.
LOUISE:
Of course, Mr. Mason, coming here was my idea.
I was afraid that if anything happened to Ed, that letter might get into the hands of the police.
Why should something happen to him?
Well, the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
We never know when our time is up.
This, um Uncle Charles your husband has accused you of poisoning, did he leave you any money?
How much?
A great deal.
And to see Ed run through it would just make you sick.
- Mr. Mason, I tell you--
- Please, Louise...
- He isn't interested.
- I didn't say that, Mrs. Davenport.
That letter could be damaging.
That's why we want you to get it for us, Mr. Mason.
Now, here's the authorisation and the, uh, retainer.
And this is the key to his office with the address on the tag.
As long as Mr. Davenport is alive, I have no right to touch that letter.
Well...
Well, there's something that I haven't mentioned.
Louise, that telephone call that came just before we left the house was from a Dr. Renault.
Ed's very ill.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was afraid you'd run to him instead of coming here, which was more important.
- Where is he?
- He's in a motel.
The Vista Motel on San Fernando Road.
Go with her.
Let me know if something happens.
- I can't tell you how--
- Better hurry.
Traffic gets bad this time of day.
As you can see, he is too weak to be moved to a hospital.
I thought it best to keep him here.
If he didn't feel well, he should've turned around and come home.
It's only an hour's drive.
[ED GASPING]
My...
My wife.
Put poison in candy.
Save your strength, Mr. Davenport.
He says he became ill after eating some chocolates.
He's out of his mind.
He didn't know what he was saying.
I hope this convinces you that going to Mr. Mason was doing the right thing.
Poison in the candy.
Don't touch it.
I packed this candy with his clothes the way I always do.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I ate a piece myself.
[ED GASPING]
Doctor.
He can't breathe.
RENAULT:
Nothing wrong here.
Lift the plastic.
- What did you give him?
- Coramine.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Davenport.
Under the circumstances, I'll have to call the police.
- The police?
- I have no choice.
You wait here, honey.
I'm gonna call Mr. Mason.
If he was to get that letter from Ed's office, there'll never be a better time.
How do you plan to get in there?
I don't think we have to.
Davenport wanted that letter found by the police easily.
- Here, you take that one.
- All right.
This is it.
"To be opened in the event of my death and contents delivered to the authorities.
Ed Davenport."
Does it belong to the widow or the authorities?
I'll answer that after I've read the contents.
- Is that working?
- I'll see.
Yeah.
I'll get some water boiling.
- Find anything?
- Mm-hm.
There was a $17,300 withdrawal from Davenport's checking account today.
He certainly didn't do it.
The entry was in a feminine hand.
[PHONE RINGING]
Shall I get it?
- Mrs. Davenport knows we're here.
- Right.
Hello.
MAN:
Unit 13.
Desert Motel.
Bakerstown.
[HANGS UP]
Hello?
Hello?
- Wrong number?
- Oh, I guess so.
All he said was Unit 13, Desert Motel, Bakerstown.
He didn't even say hello.
He didn't even say hello.
- Unit 13, Desert Motel, Bakerstown?
- Uh-huh.
I wonder what it could possibly mean?
Make a note.
Call the Drake Detective Agency.
Send Paul up there to investigate.
First thing tomorrow?
First thing tonight.
I guess this does it.
It's blank.
Invisible ink?
No.
Lieutenant Tragg, Homicide.
You Dr. Renault?
Yes, lieutenant.
The victim-- Rather, my patient.
--is in there.
He said his wife poisoned him.
The young one.
- You Mrs. Davenport?
- Yes.
There's a question as to how your husband met his death.
Oh, it was a heart attack.
He was under a doctor's care.
Who has the key?
He's gone!
[GASPS]
I wonder why he put blank pages in there?
Could be a trap to make the police think we removed incriminating evidence.
[SIREN APPROACHING]
Sounds like someone has already sprung the trap.
Good evening, officer.
- Won't you come in?
- Who are you?
My name is Mason and I'm an attorney.
This my secretary, Miss Street.
What are you doing here?
Taking charge of Edward Davenport's affairs for his widow.
He's not dead.
- He isn't.
- I'm sorry.
This is my authorization.
This is Mr. Davenport's secretary, Miss Rita Norge.
I know why you're here.
You want that letter.
He wrote a letter to the police in case he died.
It's in my desk.
Please, get it.
Just a minute, officer.
I wouldn't open that if I were you.
That's part of Davenport's estate.
I had no intention of opening, sir.
I'll just bring it down to headquarters.
I'm sure they'll know the right procedure.
[PHONE RINGING]
Answer it.
Hello?
Oh.
It's for you.
Thank you.
Hello?
Mr. Mason, something terrible has happened.
Ed's gone.
Yes, I know.
I spoke with Miss Ansel earlier.
I'm very sorry.
No, no, you don't understand.
He isn't dead.
He's disappeared.
That's, um...
That's very interesting.
What happened?
Well, the doctor declared him dead, but he must've been only unconscious.
Now the police can't find him.
All right.
I'll call you later at home.
Goodbye.
I think that concludes our business, officer.
That's just what I was thinking.
Shall we go?
- Well, we're in trouble.
- For what?
Davenport's body has evaporated.
Is he alive?
If he is, I've committed a crime or two.
Such as?
Taking charge of an estate before there was an estate.
Some people might think I was overzealous.
The district attorney included?
The district attorney included.
So this man calls from L.A. last night.
He give me the name of Stokes.
John Stokes.
Of course, how many gives their real names?
And what am I supposed to be, a human lie detector or something?
PAUL:
He did send you the money for the cabin?
MANAGER:
Sure, 5 bucks by telegraph.
He said to hold Number 13 till midnight tonight.
Well, it's after that now, so I rented it.
Business is business, I say.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, you know, I used to be a nurse.
Practical, but not registered.
Ha-ha-ha.
I didn't study so I didn't get the cap.
The cap, you know.
[MANAGER LAUGHING]
Hey, that's funny, he's still there.
He talked to me over an hour ago.
- Who is he?
- A policeman.
He was looking for Stokes too.
- Said something about narcotics.
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.
- Yes, thank you.
Does the name John Stokes mean anything to you?
John Stokes?
No.
Think it has anything to do with Ed's disappearance?
It might.
My investigator went to Bakerstown last night.
He thinks your husband used the name of "Stokes"
in making a reservation at a motel there.
Doesn't make sense.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I'll get it.
Mr. Mason, I wanna thank you while I have a chance.
- For what?
- For destroying that letter.
But I didn't destroy the letter--
Well, hello, counsellor.
Kind of early for you, isn't it?
All right, Tragg.
I'll go quietly.
I'm not here for you.
Not that Burger doesn't wanna see you.
And you'll have to come down to headquarters with me.
- What's the charge?
- Oh, no charge.
Just a few questions.
She knows nothing further about her husband's disappearance.
Well, maybe she can tell us something about her uncle.
We understand he died eight months ago under what we call "unusual circumstances."
We've got a court order to exhume the body.
You work pretty fast.
If I'd known that you were the attorney for Mrs. Davenport,
I'd have done even better.
There was nothing wrong.
Uncle Charles died of pleurisy.
Coroner said it was arsenic poisoning.
But that's impossible.
I was with--
Lieutenant?
Found this in the garage.
TRAGG:
Hmm.
Sixty-two percent arsenic.
Would you know anything about this, Mrs. Davenport?
I use that to spray plants.
TRAGG:
You sure you didn't use it for anything else?
The candy in your husband's motel room was loaded with the stuff.
LOUISE:
No.
TRAGG:
Quite a coincidence, isn't it?
- You bought him that candy.
- Louise.
And when I wanted to get a nurse for Uncle Charles you said no, it wasn't necessary.
You could take care of him yourself.
MASON:
Miss Ansel, I must-- LOUISE:
What a fool I was.
When Ed showed me that report from the lab,
I thought it was something he'd made up.
- What report?
- You don't believe--
Go on, Miss Ansel.
You were saying?
Ed brought back a report yesterday from the Pacific Laboratories.
It proved there was arsenic in some sandwiches that Myrna made for him.
That's not true.
All along I thought Ed was crazy.
All along I thought it was something he'd arranged.
But you killed Uncle Charles just the way you killed him.
I didn't, I didn't.
[MYRNA SOBBING]
Well, Burger's going to love this case.
With a witness like this, how can he lose?
MYRNA:
You've got to believe me, Mr. Burger.
I'm telling the truth.
I wanna believe you, Mrs. Davenport, very much.
But there are lot of things here that are unexplained.
What was your husband doing with that candy?
The doctor told him to eat some any time he felt the urge to drink.
I see.
Only this batch happened to be loaded with arsenic.
I know.
BURGER:
And your fingerprints happened to be on the box.
MASON:
Why shouldn't they be?
She's admitted she packed the candy.
What's that got to do with her Uncle Charles?
Well, he died of arsenic poisoning.
And I'm sure when her husband's body--
As far as we know, her husband is still alive.
What about the statement of Miss Ansel?
The outburst of an hysterical woman.
All right, Mrs. Davenport.
You're free to go on your recognisance.
We'll be in touch with you.
Mr. Mason, I'd like to speak to you for a minute, please.
It's all right, Mr. Mason.
I can get home alone.
Did you open an envelope in Ed Davenport's office last night, an envelope addressed to the authorities in the event of his death?
As one attorney to another,
I'd say that question was improperly phrased.
As a matter of fact, it's loaded.
All right, I'll rephrase it.
Can you deny that you steamed this open and replaced the original contents?
Who gave you the right to open that?
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello.
Hold it.
It says right on the envelope,
"to be delivered to the authorities in the event of my death."
Exactly.
Who says he's dead?
Dr. Renault.
Corpses don't run away unless they never were corpses in the first place.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Hello.
Yes.
You have?
Where?
Great work, Tragg.
You go ahead.
I'll join you.
I think maybe we'll get some answers now.
We've caught up with the runaway corpse, Mr. Mason.
They found Davenport's body.
TRAGG:
Get in touch with the morgue right away.
- Right.
- Any word from the coroner?
- Not yet.
- No question it's Davenport.
Dr. Renault identified the body.
- Who discovered the body?
- Those two kids.
The father put in the call.
He runs the gas station down the highway.
Mr. Medford?
Mr. Medford, this is District Attorney Burger and Mr. Mason.
BURGER:
How did your boys happen to find the body?
Well, uh, they found the grave first.
- When was this?
MEDFORD:
Tuesday afternoon.
Looked like one of them slit trenches, only deeper.
They told me about it only I didn't pay no attention.
You know how kids are.
Yesterday, they played here again.
Then this morning, it was filled up.
They dug some, then came a-calling for me.
I see.
Thanks, Mr. Medford.
I'll be in touch with you later.
KENNY:
Lieutenant.
Excuse me.
Radio call from the coroner.
He finish the preliminary autopsy?
It was arsenic.
All right, Tragg.
You know what to do.
Let's go, sergeant.
Mason, I'll make you a deal.
I've got everything I need for a first-degree murder conviction.
- But?
- You have your client plead guilty and I won't ask for the death penalty.
I understand the husband mistreated her and--
Then you'll charge her with first degree on her uncle's death, is that right?
[CHUCKLES]
All right, Mason.
In that case, you'll have some explaining to do yourself.
You destroyed vital evidence to protect your client.
We'll see how that sits with a jury.
You are pretty enough without that.
All right, Paul, what is it this time?
Why, Grandma, what a suspicious mind you have.
Is the boss in?
No, he went over to see Mrs. Davenport.
PAUL:
Mm.
"Jason Beckmeyer, licensed private investigator."
Remember me telling you about a guy watching Unit 13
- at that motel up in Bakerstown?
- Yeah.
I got a hold of his licence number before he took off.
And this is the gentleman in question?
Mm-hm.
- Know anything about him?
- No.
Not much.
He, uh, runs a small detective agency.
I wonder what he was doing.
[PHONE RINGS]
Yes, Gertie?
I'll be right out.
Speak of the devil.
Guess who's in the reception room right now.
Mr. Jason Beckmeyer himself.
- Mr. Beckmeyer?
- That's right.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mason's out right now.
I'm his secretary, Miss Street.
Oh, I wanted to see Mason.
He's representing the Davenport estate, isn't he?
Well, he represents Mrs. Davenport.
Well, I did some work for her husband and I'd like to get paid.
What kind of work?
I don't know if I should talk about it.
- Well, you can't expect Mr. Mason--
- No, uh...
Davenport wanted me to keep an eye on The Desert Motel in Bakerstown.
- What was his reason?
- He didn't say.
He just said I should watch Unit 13.
It was reserved by a man named Stokes.
Did you see Mr. Stokes?
Yeah.
He came in late that night.
- What did he look like?
- He was tall, good-looking guy with grey hair.
He was about 6'2".
He was driving a white sports car.
I got a good look at him while he was talking to the manager.
Well, I'll relay your message to Mr. Mason.
- Can he do anything about my bill?
- Oh, he'll call you.
Tell him any time he needs an operative, I'm available.
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks.
PAUL:
What did he want?
- He found Stokes.
No kidding?
Did you get a description?
Yes.
He said he was tall, about 6'2", had grey hair and was driving a white sports car.
Though I can't understand why he thought he was good-looking.
[PHONE RINGS]
Yes, Gertie?
- It's for you.
Don Gregory.
- Oh, yeah.
New man I just put on.
Yes, Don.
Uh-huh.
You're sure of that?
Right away.
He's been tailing Rita Norge.
She went into Davenport's office ten minutes ago.
She's still there.
She's not supposed to be.
Lieutenant Tragg said everyone should stay away.
That was my impression.
I'm gonna go get Perry.
Nothing to be afraid of.
We didn't knock for obvious reasons.
- You have no right--
- Have you?
I came to get my personal things.
Including those papers?
They were in my desk.
I think the district attorney might find this rather peculiar.
Mr. Davenport seems to have sold a few of his investments recently.
He sold all of them a few months ago.
Are you in the habit of drawing money out of Mr. Davenport's account?
No.
You withdrew over $17,000 yesterday.
What business is it of yours?
The Davenport estate is in my hands.
I'd like to see his widow receive her full share.
Don't worry, Mr. Mason.
She'll get everything that's coming to her.
MASON:
I realise how busy you are, lieutenant, but do you think you could possibly spare me just a few minutes?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mason.
You got something on your mind?
Yes, I think you ought to check Rita Norge again.
Find out what she was doing at Davenport's office Thursday night.
Well, I did.
Mr. Davenport ask her to drop by.
- Why?
- Well, he had an errand for her.
He was going to phone the office and tell her where to go.
You know what I mean.
You believe that story?
Listen, the day Ed Davenport was at the Vista Motel, someone withdrew $17,300 from his checking account.
Now, who do you suppose that someone was?
Rita Norge?
I think she was planning to leave town with the money.
That's why she killed him?
Isn't it possible?
Yeah.
But there's just one teeny thing wrong with that theory, Mr. Mason.
Miss Norge was in yesterday afternoon.
What do you suppose she wanted?
Don't tell me she turned the money over to you.
All right, I won't tell you.
But if you'd care to see a duplicate of the receipt I gave her,
I'd be happy to oblige.
Miss Ansel.
Yes?
I'm Jason Beckmeyer.
You called my office this morning.
Yes, I wanted to see you.
BECKMEYER:
Well?
I can't talk here.
Could you come to my house this evening?
- Okay, what time?
- Right after court's adjourned.
- Here.
Here is my address.
- I know the address.
Thank you.
BURGER:
And in your capacity as deputy coroner for this county, you performed an autopsy on the body of the deceased, Edward Davenport?
HOXIE:
I did.
BURGER:
What did you find, Dr. Hoxie?
HOXIE:
After making certain tests,
I detected the presence of a specific poison, arsenic.
Would you please tell the court, doctor, what conclusions you draw from this.
There is no doubt that death was caused by stoppage of the heart, due in turn to ingestion of the poison.
Do you have an opinion as to how the poison was administered?
Through food the victim ate an hour before his death.
Did you analyse the candy found in Mr. Davenport's room?
- I did.
- What did you find?
- It contained arsenic.
- Thank you, doctor.
[CROWD MURMURING]
Dr. Hoxie, when you say "stoppage of the heart,"
do you mean that a heart attack caused Davenport's death?
Yes, although the poison would have caused his death in 12 hours in any event.
Did you test the body for blood alcohol?
I did.
It contain 0.15 percent of alcohol.
That's enough to indicate the beginnings of intoxication.
MASON:
Then the arsenic could have been administered in a drink?
- That is possible.
- So you were merely hypothesizing when you said that the poison was introduced into the system through the chocolates.
I beg your pardon.
I said nothing of the sort.
I said I felt that the poison had been introduced through the food.
What do you mean by "the food"?
Well, the victim ingested a meal of bacon and eggs approximately an hour before his death.
- You found no trace of chocolate?
- I did not.
Thank you, doctor.
I will now call Dr. Frank Renault.
CLERK:
Dr. Renault to the stand, please.
JUDGE:
You may step down.
HOXIE:
Thank you.
RENAULT:
I got to his cabin around noon.
He said he'd eaten several chocolates an hour before.
Did he say where he got the chocolates?
RENAULT:
He said his wife bought them for him.
BURGER:
How do you account for the fact the coroner found no chocolate in the body?
When Mr. Davenport told me he'd been poisoned,
I immediately pumped his stomach.
I see.
Your witness.
Well, Dr. Renault, your testimony seems to be in accord with Dr. Hoxie's regarding this fatal heart attack.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, uh, when did death occur?
At exactly 15 minutes past 5 p.m.
MASON:
At which time you locked the door of Davenport's cabin?
I did.
One thing puzzles me, doctor.
You say you pumped the victim's stomach?
That's fairly routine procedure in cases of poisoning.
Well, how do you account for the fact that Dr. Hoxie found traces of bacon and eggs eaten approximately an hour before death?
Well, uh...
I don't know.
You must agree it's a peculiar situation.
Dr. Hoxie has Mr. Davenport sitting down to bacon and eggs while you have him in an oxygen tent.
If the court please, I agree that it's a peculiar situation.
In order to investigate that situation further
I request an adjournment till tomorrow morning.
Does the defence have any objections?
- None at all, Your Honour.
JUDGE:
Very well.
You may step down.
The case is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Check Dr. Renault back to the day he hung out his shingle.
All right.
MASON:
Everything's gonna work out.
- Thank you.
Will you drop this by the office for me?
Where you going?
It's such a nice day,
I thought I'd ask Della to take me for a walk in the country.
For a minute, I nearly thought you were serious when you said "a walk in the country."
Well, aren't we?
I can think of more picturesque places.
MASON:
According to those kids, this grave was prepared in advance.
Who would have known Davenport was gonna get sick and have to call a doctor?
And who would have known he was gonna die?
His secretary?
No, that wouldn't work.
Why not?
Well, if Rita Norge were dishonest, she never would've turned that money over to Lieutenant Tragg.
If she'd hidden a couple of hundred thousand belonging to Davenport, then the money she gave Tragg would've been a cheap price to pay for a reputation of honesty.
True.
What are you looking for?
The coroner said that Davenport had eaten bacon and eggs before he died.
- Well?
- Well, where did he get them?
Hmm.
We passed a diner about seven or eight miles back.
Can you see him walking in there in pyjamas?
Well, don't tell me he pitched a tent and cooked over a campfire.
What about a modern version of the same?
A house trailer?
Suppose you take that way, I'll take this one.
- Sing out if you find anything.
- All right.
LOUISE:
You've got to understand, Mr. Beckmeyer.
My cousin didn't kill her husband.
I, uh...
I don't know what possessed me to say what I did.
I always talk too much.
Most people do.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
I know who killed Ed.
Then I suggest you go to the police.
It was that secretary.
That Rita Norge.
Where do you suppose all the money went?
What money?
Well, my Uncle Charles left Myrna over $280,000.
She has less than $40,000 left.
Now, Ed Davenport didn't spend all that.
He gave it to that woman to hold for him.
Over $200,000.
That's a very interesting theory.
How do you suppose we can prove it?
We?
Well, you're a private detective.
You ought to know about these things.
How do we get the police to question her?
- They already have.
- I mean really question her.
If they could be suspicious, wouldn't that help?
How would it suit you, Miss Ansel, if the police found arsenic in Miss Norge's apartment?
You mean you would--?
Well, you want them to question her.
If they found arsenic they would.
- But wouldn't that be--?
- Framing?
That all depends on how you look at it.
If Miss Norge is guilty, we have just put the police on the right track.
And then if she's innocent, why, she could easily prove it.
That's right.
Of course, you know this kind of operation runs into money.
Oh, I don't care what it costs.
Just wanna try to make it up to Myrna.
BECKMEYER:
Hm.
Tell me, Miss Ansel, where do you get your ideas about private detectives?
From the movies?
But this was your idea.
That's right.
Now I've got another one.
I think I'll save this for the DA.
Perry.
Perry, over here.
Crankcase oil.
A car must have stood here for some time.
DELLA:
Well?
Nice work, Della.
This is it.
CLERK:
Will the court please rise?
Be seated.
If the court please, I'd like to continue my cross-examination of Dr. Renault.
CLERK:
Dr. Renault to the stand, please.
JUDGE:
You were sworn in yesterday, sir.
You're still under oath.
Dr. Renault, when was the first time you were called in to treat Mr. Davenport?
On Wednesday around noon.
Who called you in?
The owner of the Vista Motel.
He said one of his guests was ill.
Are you the only doctor in the neighbourhood?
Yes, sir.
I live just around the corner.
Had you ever seen Mr. Davenport before you were called in?
I don't understand.
Had he ever consulted you at your office?
Not that I recall.
I should like you to remember, doctor, that you're under oath.
Now, had you ever seen Mr. Davenport before you treated him at the Vista Motel?
I...
I may have.
For what purpose?
You ought to know that the conversation between a doctor and a patient is privileged.
Did he tell you then that he wanted to die or rather that he wanted to have it appear that he had died?
I repeat, the communication between a doctor and a patient is privileged.
Very well.
Now, uh, doctor, will you please tell the court what medical degree you hold and from what institution?
Doctor of Health Medicine.
Jackson State Medical College.
MASON:
Where is this college located?
Well, uh, it's no longer in existence.
MASON:
Was the school accredited to any medical association?
- No.
- Dr. Renault, did you not conspire with Ed Davenport to stage his death in the presence of his wife?
And then wasn't your plan to accuse her of poisoning him?
I refuse to answer on the ground it would tend to incriminate me.
MASON:
That certainly is your constitutional right.
However, I'm sure the answers can be gained from another source.
That's all, doctor.
If the court please, I'd like to call Jason Beckmeyer to the stand.
- Paul?
- Don't worry.
My man will be here.
CLERK:
Mr. Beckmeyer.
Raise your right hand.
You solemnly swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
Be seated and state your name.
Jason Beckmeyer.
Mr. Beckmeyer, you are a licensed private investigator?
That's right.
MASON:
You were employed in that capacity by the late Edward Davenport?
I was.
Did he ever ask you to locate a doctor for him who was not a member of the American Medical Association?
He did.
He wanted me to find a quack who had an office near a motor court.
MASON:
And you found a man who met those requirements?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Renault.
MASON:
Did you make the appointment with Dr. Renault?
BECKMEYER:
No, no.
Davenport took care of that himself.
MASON:
Would you happen to remember the date of that meeting?
Yeah, it was February 7th.
MASON:
Exactly one week before Mr. Davenport died.
- That's right.
- You have any idea what took place at that meeting?
BECKMEYER:
No, sir.
No, I stayed in the car.
What other services did you render Mr. Davenport?
Well, when he wanted a reputable laboratory to do food analysis,
I put him in touch with Pacific Labs.
Did you ever act as dummy for various bank accounts so that Davenport could juggle funds belonging to his wife?
BECKMEYER:
I didn't know where he got the money.
MASON:
But you did allow yourself to be used for the purpose of opening several bank accounts?
BECKMEYER:
Yes, I did.
I didn't see anything wrong in that.
Were you at any time engaged by Davenport to drive him out of the country?
No, sir.
I have here a statement from the Department of Motor Vehicles which indicates that you own a house trailer.
- Is that true, Mr. Beckmeyer?
- Yes.
Was the late Edward Davenport ever in that trailer?
No, no.
Never.
If an expert were to produce fingerprints,
Davenport's fingerprints, from the inside of that trailer, would you swear on your oath that they were forgeries?
Well, he might have been in there once.
I don't remember for sure.
Mr. Beckmeyer, isn't it a fact that Davenport was in your trailer on the day he died?
Oh, no.
Then where did he get the bacon and eggs?
- In that trailer.
- That's a lie.
And where did he get the liquor?
None was found in his room.
You gave it to him, did you not?
Generously spiked with arsenic.
I tell you, you're wrong.
Then answer this, Mr. Beckmeyer.
If you did not kill Davenport why did you dig that grave two days in advance?
- I didn't.
- What other reason could you have for buying a shovel from the Clarey Hardware Store on that very same day?
Yeah.
Well, the chump was asking for it.
Never got tired of telling me how smart he was.
He was gonna disappear and leave his wife holding the bag.
Everybody would wonder what happened to the body.
It was such a great plan
I figured with a little help from me, it would be perfect.
Guess I was wrong too, huh?
[CROWD MURMURING]
PAUL:
Just a little bit more to the right.
That's fine.
You know, Paul I don't know what we'd do without you.
Don't tell him that, Della.
He'll send us a bill in the morning.
You gotta admit my fees are more reasonable than Beckmeyer's.
I hear there was almost 200 grand in his trailer.
Two hundred and ten to be exact.
You know, the thing that puzzles me is Uncle Charlie.
- Who did him in?
- Ed Davenport.
He wanted his wife to be an heiress.
So he could steal her blind and then disappear.
Mm-hm.
That's when Mr. Beckmeyer came in.
He was the guiding genius of the plot.
I may not be very smart, but I still don't see how you suspected Beckmeyer in the first place.
That telephone call you took in Davenport's office.
"Unit 13, Desert Motel, Bakerstown."
That's right.
That call was obviously for Rita Norge.
Yeah?
She had over $17,000 belonging to Davenport, remember?
If Davenport did make the call, why then--
Then Beckmeyer must have.
He wanted to get his hot little hands on the money.
So Beckmeyer was responsible for those blank pages in the letter.
No, no, that was Davenport's idea.
And a very provocative one.
He made sure the police would believe that letter had been tampered with.
Well, you gotta give Davenport credit.
He wasn't anybody's fool.
He just never should've hired Beckmeyer.
What's wrong with this picture, anyway?
It's Beckmeyer's influence, Della.
Just a case of a slightly crooked frame.
[MASON CHUCKLING]
Good evening.
I hope you'll excuse me for not being ready at show time but my watch is slow.
As a matter of fact, it hasn't even gotten here yet.
First, I would like to announce a change in our program.
Shakespeare's Hamlet will not be presented tonight.
We don't feel it suitable to show in the home.
All those corpses, you know.
Instead, we're offering a story entitled
"The Hands of Mr. Ottermole."
Most of our stories have taken place in the United States or one of the other colonies.
But tonight we offer a new locale.
"The Hands of Mr. Ottermole"
is laid in a far-off land of mystery and enchantment.
England.
And now suppose you continue squinting at this little screen while I slip into something more uncomfortable.
No, thank you.
Well, here I am.
Is that you, Herbert?
Well, now, who did you think it was, your gentleman friend?
Oh, Herbert!
Kippers.
You know, I've been having a discussion with myself all the way home.
"Wonder what she's got for tea." I said,
"Haddock or herring.
"I bet its haddock, but I hope not."
Kippers would be just the thing on a night like this.
Well, all right, then.
Your slippers are in here waiting for you.
Now, that's a blessing.
My feet are killing me.
Half a mo'.
There's someone at the door.
Oh, hello!
Won't you come in?
We're just going to sit down for tea.
We're going to have kippers, you know.
Herbert?
Here!
I said stop it!
Ain't it terrible?
Both of them...
Here, let me...
...and not a single witness.
Let me see, can't you.
Now then, now then, now then, keep back, everybody.
Outside the house, now.
Petersen!
Petersen.
Now, you have to keep it quiet.
Come on.
Outside, outside.
Come on, get back there.
I don't know you!
Mr. Whybrow's nephew from down the way.
Oh, all right, come in, come in.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go on home, go on home.
Well, now, you say you're his nephew.
Yes, I live down the road a piece.
Who did it?
Well, now, we don't know about that as yet.
I'm finished here, Sarge.
I searched the back premises, nothing there.
Not a trace.
All right.
See if you can find anyone nearby who saw anything or heard anything unusual.
Right-o!
Now, come on.
Get back.
What happened?
They were strangled, we know that much.
But as to who did it, that's something else again.
I was passing nearby and I saw the door open.
So I looked in and there they were, just like that.
Dead.
And not a few minutes before I found them either.
But no sign of who did it, and no sign of a struggle or anything like that.
Would your uncle keep any sums of money about the place?
Or anything of value like?
Not that I know of.
I'm sure that he didn't have no sums of money to amount to much.
I could swear to that.
Very well.
Would you take a look about the place, see if there's anything missing?
Or anything at all out of the way?
You know, not like it ought to be.
Yes, all right.
Well, you didn't hear anything at all in here?
Did you hear him come home or go into his house?
Call out to anybody?
No sound of a struggle?
Nothing at all, eh?
No, not a thing.
Me and the missus was in the back, you see, having our tea.
Say, what kind of a chap was he?
Did you know him at all well?
Lived next door to him for five years now.
Very quiet, dependable sort of fellow.
Everybody liked him.
Mmm-hmm.
Can't find a thing in the house that don't look everyday and proper.
Not anywhere at all.
Well, I didn't think you would.
There weren't any fingerprints, were there?
No.
Not a sign.
Ah, that'll be the ambulance.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
There's just no reason to it.
Oh, there's a reason all right.
Must be.
They're dead, aren't they?
Sergeant, remember me?
I'm from The Guardian, I'd like to...
How did you get here so quickly?
I live around here.
But what I'd like to know is...
Sorry no time for the press just at present, Sir.
You'll have to wait a bit.
Now, now.
Now then, stand back.
I am sorry, gentleman, that is all the information we have for you just at present.
You've read the papers, I suppose?
Yes, I have.
It's kicked up an awful stir.
The senseless wantonness of these killings has everybody talking about them.
I've been told to stick with this story till it's solved.
So have I.
So you better produce some results, eh, Sergeant.
You've made no progress so far.
What we might know and what we're able to tell you are two different things.
However, you may say that we expect to have something definite...
To report at an early date.
No, I'm afraid the public won't accept that in this case, Sergeant.
Now, see here, this only happened the night before last.
You can't expect us to nab the man instantly when he left no clues at all.
So you have made no progress then?
Now, wait a minute, I didn't say that.
I didn't say that at all.
You're twisting my words.
Buy a flower.
Buy a flower for your young lady, Sir,
I ain't sold none all day.
All right.
Nearly closing time, Ben.
You were a bit late last night, we can't have that, you know.
Don't worry, Sarge.
We ride in the dark tonight.
Last call for drinks.
Well, call that fair?
I don't.
I don't call that fair.
After all, we've only had four days.
These things can't be done overnight, you know.
That's an editorial, old boy.
No good to complain to me about it.
I just have to turn in a story each day.
And you must confess, you haven't given me very much to turn in so far.
You or Scotland Yard.
Now, look here, you can't expect us to tell you every move we make, you know.
Then the criminal would know what we're doing, too, wouldn't he?
Come on now, Sergeant, we're talking about progress and you can't report anything because you haven't made any.
Have you?
Time, gentleman.
Please drink up and pay up.
All out.
By the way,
I find it remarkable how you gentleman of the press arrived at the spot so quickly.
Well, I'm a roving reporter now and I...
That's where I happened to be roving at the time.
Good night, Sergeant.
Good night.
Time's up.
All right.
Buy a flower for the young lady, sir?
Good evening, Sir.
It's been a long day.
Business ain't been so good.
And I was having a bit of a rest
Good morning, Sergeant.
Have you seen The Guardian?
No, and I don't want to.
Thank you very much.
So, you've made no progress with the old flower woman either.
Mr. Summers, how about a cup of tea?
Thanks.
A little sugar if you please.
You know, I had a theory about this at the start.
The Whybrows, that is.
Since it seemed like there was no reason for killing them at all,
I thought maybe the reason why there seemed to be no reason was because there isn't any reason.
You see what I mean?
He made a mistake, thought he was killing somebody else, went to the wrong house or something.
Eh, Sarge?
Well, of course it's no good now.
He wouldn't make two mistakes.
And now we've got two sets of killing and no reason at all.
Doesn't seem to make sense somehow.
Wonder what the motive could be?
Maybe there wasn't any.
Oh, there was a motive all right.
You can count on that.
There has to be a motive, you know.
No, no.
No.
There've been crimes, murders, without motives before.
Oh, come now, you don't mean no motive at all?
That's right, there have.
Neil Cream for one.
And William Palmer for another, eh, Sergeant?
That's right.
He was another.
I say, if you're up against a man like that, you're in real trouble, aren't you?
Never know where he'll strike next or when.
Or what he's like or anything.
Let's visualize a man.
He appears ordinary, but yet he isn't.
Nothing so old-fashioned as a conscience bothers him, yet he has three murders to his credit.
And I'm sure he's sitting somewhere now calmly drinking a cup of tea, just as we are
and smiling to himself because the police are such fools.
He's got something to smile about and that's a fact.
But he isn't an Englishman.
He's a foreigner.
They're all around this district, you know.
Why not an Englishman?
'Cause we British haven't got the nature for a thing like that.
Nor the talent for it either.
One of these foreign johnnies.
They know tricks that we've never even heard of and wouldn't practice if we had.
Well, whoever he is and wherever he's from, he's a man to reckon with.
There's no escaping that.
You can't admire him certainly.
But you have to admit he's clever.
Do you realize what he's done?
Yes.
He strangled three helpless, innocent people, that's what.
Oh, it's much more than that.
Have you been around this district lately?
The people only talk about one subject.
The children aren't allowed to play in the streets.
Women do their shopping before dark and bolt their windows and doors at night.
They watch anxiously for their husbands' return from work.
Men eye each other, even familiar faces, and think, "It might be him."
This one man with a pair of hands has terrified this whole community and made them realize that the laws are powerful only so long as they are obeyed.
The police are potent so long as they are feared.
You seem so positive we're dealing with just one man.
Would you say there were two men, Sergeant, like that?
Two men in the same place and at the same time?
No, I'll own it seems unlikely.
That's right.
This is a singular man.
A man who comes along once in a lifetime probably.
This one man with one pair of hands has held the entire police force and Scotland Yard helpless with nowhere to turn.
Aye, he's done that.
Part of it, at least.
But as for having us powerless, with nowhere to turn, that's something else again.
It is?
You have your informers out, I'm sure, in the pubs and the tea rooms.
But aside from that, what have you done?
What can you do?
He's made some mistake somewhere.
Or he'll make one.
You can bank on that.
And we'll be watching, never fear.
Maybe he won't, though.
What then?
He will.
They always do.
Hmm, but they don't.
Now that's the thing.
What about Dr. Crippen?
And George Joseph Smith?
You've heard of them, Sergeant?
Aye, I have.
Well, those people killed and were discovered only years afterwards by accident or belated confession.
Now, there must be many others who have never been discovered.
Now, you say the murderer is always caught because all the ones we know of have been caught.
But think of the others.
The ones we don't know about yet.
You seem to have made a great study of crime, Mr. Newspaperman.
I have.
Tell me, Sergeant, in your professional opinion, do you really believe you can catch this man if he doesn't want you to?
Oh, aye.
We'll catch him.
Because we have to.
We've doubled our force the day after the first murder.
And now we have four men where we usually have one.
We are just hoping he will try again.
If he does, we've got him.
I see.
Of course, he might try somewhere else the next time.
You can't have quadrupled your force throughout the entire city.
That's true.
But he might just be the type of man who would like to show us he could kill again beneath our noses and still get away with it.
Hmm?
Bye for now.
Good day.
Well, hello there, Jimmy.
Would you like to go across?
Right then, here we go.
Here we are.
Now, up.
Well?
Not a thing.
Keep a sharp lookout every second.
That's what it takes, you know.
Can't let up because we've had four days with nothing new.
I only spoke to Petersen.
It was 9:32 by my watch.
And you found him at 9:35.
That's when you blew your whistle.
What happened?
Another one?
Yes.
Got one of their own men this time.
It's Petersen.
I can't believe it.
Johnson, take over.
Make way.
Make way, now.
You heard nothing?
You saw no sign of anybody at all?
Nobody.
Nobody.
Not a blinking soul.
Except Jimmy, the blind bootblack.
But it can't be him.
There wasn't a sound or a movement on this street as I came along it.
Nothing, until...
But it must have happened right under your nose, man.
Not seconds after you left him.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Blimey, Sarge, he must live hereabouts.
That's certain.
But where?
Where?
Nobody saw, nobody heard, nothing.
All right.
You and the others spread out.
Search all the buildings on both sides of the street.
Question everybody.
Pull them out of bed if need be.
Look into cupboards and behind curtains.
Don't accept excuses.
Here we are, Sir.
Thank you, Ben.
Things have come to a pretty pass and no mistake.
When a man or woman walks out alone these days, does nothing less than take his life in his hands, and that's the truth.
They'll catch him soon.
Any time now.
What makes you so certain?
When a man can kills you or me, that's one thing.
But when a copper gets killed, that's another story.
Then all the other coppers realize maybe they're next.
They won't rest till the murderer is caught.
See?
What will you have, sir?
Same as usual.
All right.
Don't even know what this creature is.
Man, beast or devil.
Well, I know I shan't run out alone again.
He's mad.
Unbalanced somehow.
Don't you agree?
Possibly.
Probably.
But there's something else about this.
Something obvious.
Something right in front of us.
You see, when there's something right before our eyes, we don't stop to ask how it got there.
Like the ham in that sandwich.
It's just there.
We don't think of it at all.
Much less stop to say, "How did it get there?"
How did it get there, by the by?
Well, somebody put it there, I dare say.
Yes.
That's right.
Somebody did.
Sergeant?
Is that you, Sergeant?
Oh, it's you.
Yes.
Well, seen anything of the murderer?
No, nor has anybody else.
I doubt if they ever will.
Oh, I don't know.
I've been thinking about it and an idea came to me just now.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Came to me all of a sudden, just a little while ago.
Made me feel as though we've been blind.
It's been staring us in the face.
Oh, has it?
Well, if you're so sure, why not give us the benefit of this idea?
I'm going to.
We were talking in the bar now about things that are staring us in the face.
Things that we don't think about to question.
Like the ham in a sandwich, you know.
We never wonder how it got there.
But somebody said, "Well, if it's there,
"somebody must have put it there."
And that was it.
Now, if four people have been murdered, somebody must have been there to murder them, you see.
Well, of course someone was there.
We all know that.
Question is, who?
Yes.
The answer seems so simple now.
But there's one thing I don't understand.
One little thing I'd like to clear up.
I mean, the motive.
As man to man, tell me, Sergeant Ottermole,
just why did you kill those inoffensive people?
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Newspaperman,
I don't know.
In fact, I've been worried about it myself.
But, I've got an idea, just like you.
Everybody knows we can't control the workings of our minds, don't they?
Ideas come without our asking.
But everybody's supposed to be able to control the workings of his body.
Why?
Our arms, our legs, our heads, aren't completely ours.
We don't make them.
And couldn't ideas come into our limbs, just like ideas come into our minds?
Huh?
Couldn't ideas live in nerve and muscle as well as in the brain?
And couldn't it be that parts of our bodies aren't really us?
And ideas could come into those parts all of a sudden like ideas come into
my hands?
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Yes.
I never saw anything so quick or anyone so strong.
I thought I was done for, for a moment.
I know.
We were following as close as we dared.
It's a good thing we got the constable here in time.
The sergeant.
I can't believe it.
His hands were like iron.
Yes, his hands.
Did you hear what he said about his hands?
He said ideas came into his hands.
He must have been insane.
Yes
I suppose so.
Ow!
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'll tie it myself.
It won't take long.
I'm sure I'll be ready by next week's show.
And you be ready, too.
Good evening.
I hope you'll excuse me for not being ready at show time but my watch is slow.
As a matter of fact, it hasn't even gotten here yet.
First, I would like to announce a change in our program.
Shakespeare's Hamlet will not be presented tonight.
We don't feel it suitable to show in the home.
All those corpses, you know.
Instead, we're offering a story entitled
"The Hands of Mr. Ottermole. "
Most of our stories have taken place in the United States or one of the other colonies.
But tonight we offer a new locale.
"The Hands of Mr. Ottermole"
is laid in a far-off land of mystery and enchantment.
England.
And now suppose you continue squinting at this little screen while I slip into something more uncomfortable.
No, thank you.
Well, here I am.
Is that you, Herbert?
Well, now, who did you think it was, your gentleman friend?
Oh, Herbert!
Kippers.
You know, I've been having a discussion with myself all the way home.
"Wonder what she's got for tea. " I said,
"Haddock or herring.
"I bet its haddock, but I hope not. "
Kippers would be just the thing on a night like this.
Well, all right, then.
Your slippers are in here waiting for you.
Now, that's a blessing.
My feet are killing me.
Half a mo'.
There's someone at the door.
Oh, hello!
Won't you come in?
We're just going to sit down for tea.
We're going to have kippers, you know.
Herbert?
Here!
I said stop it!
Ain't it terrible?
Both of them...
Here, let me...
... and not a single witness.
Let me see, can't you.
Now then, now then, now then, keep back, everybody.
Outside the house, now.
Petersen!
Petersen.
Now, you have to keep it quiet.
Come on.
Outside, outside.
Come on, get back there.
I don't know you!
Mr. Whybrow's nephew from down the way.
Oh, all right, come in, come in.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go on home, go on home.
Well, now, you say you're his nephew.
Yes, I live down the road a piece.
Who did it?
Well, now, we don't know about that as yet.
I'm finished here, Sarge.
I searched the back premises, nothing there.
Not a trace.
All right.
See if you can find anyone nearby who saw anything or heard anything unusual.
Right-o!
Now, come on.
Get back.
What happened?
They were strangled, we know that much.
But as to who did it, that's something else again.
I was passing nearby and I saw the door open.
So I looked in and there they were, just like that.
Dead.
And not a few minutes before I found them either.
But no sign of who did it, and no sign of a struggle or anything like that.
Would your uncle keep any sums of money about the place?
Or anything of value like?
Not that I know of.
I'm sure that he didn't have no sums of money to amount to much.
I could swear to that.
Very well.
Would you take a look about the place, see if there's anything missing?
Or anything at all out of the way?
You know, not like it ought to be.
Yes, all right.
Well, you didn't hear anything at all in here?
Did you hear him come home or go into his house?
Call out to anybody?
No sound of a struggle?
Nothing at all, eh?
No, not a thing.
Me and the missus was in the back, you see, having our tea.
Say, what kind of a chap was he?
Did you know him at all well?
Lived next door to him for five years now.
Very quiet, dependable sort of fellow.
Everybody liked him.
Mmm-hmm.
Can't find a thing in the house that don't look everyday and proper.
Not anywhere at all.
Well, I didn't think you would.
There weren't any fingerprints, were there?
No.
Not a sign.
Ah, that'll be the ambulance.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
There's just no reason to it.
Oh, there's a reason all right.
Must be.
They're dead, aren't they?
Sergeant, remember me?
I'm from The Guardian, I'd like to...
How did you get here so quickly?
I live around here.
But what I'd like to know is...
Sorry no time for the press just at present, Sir.
You'll have to wait a bit.
Now, now.
Now then, stand back.
I am sorry, gentleman, that is all the information we have for you just at present.
You've read the papers, I suppose?
Yes, I have.
It's kicked up an awful stir.
The senseless wantonness of these killings has everybody talking about them.

Now, wait a minute, I didn't say that.

Buy a flower.
Buy a flower for your young lady, Sir,
I ain't sold none all day.
All right.
Nearly closing time, Ben.
You were a bit late last night, we can't have that, you know.
Don't worry, Sarge.
We ride in the dark tonight.
Last call for drinks.
Well, call that fair?
I don't.
I don't call that fair.
After all, we've only had four days.
These things can't be done overnight, you know.
That's an editorial, old boy.

It's been a long day.
Business ain't been so good.
And I was having a bit of a rest
Good morning, Sergeant.

No, and I don't want to.
Thank you very much.
So, you've made no progress with the old flower woman either.
Mr. Summers, how about a cup of tea?

Well, hello there, Jimmy.
Would you like to go across?
Right then, here we go.
Here we are.
Now, up.
Well?
Not a thing.
Keep a sharp lookout every second.
That's what it takes, you know.
Can't let up because we've had four days with nothing new.
I only spoke to Petersen.
It was 9:32 by my watch.
And you found him at 9:35.
That's when you blew your whistle.
What happened?
Another one?
Yes.
Got one of their own men this time.
It's Petersen.
I can't believe it.
Johnson, take over.
Make way.
Make way, now.
You heard nothing?
You saw no sign of anybody at all?
Nobody.
Nobody.
Not a blinking soul.
Except Jimmy, the blind bootblack.
But it can't be him.
There wasn't a sound or a movement on this street as I came along it.
Nothing, until...
But it must have happened right under your nose, man.
Not seconds after you left him.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Blimey, Sarge, he must live hereabouts.
That's certain.
But where?
Where?
Nobody saw, nobody heard, nothing.
All right.
You and the others spread out.
Search all the buildings on both sides of the street.
Question everybody.
Pull them out of bed if need be.
Look into cupboards and behind curtains.
Don't accept excuses.
Here we are, Sir.
Thank you, Ben.
Things have come to a pretty pass and no mistake.
When a man or woman walks out alone these days, does nothing less than take his life in his hands, and that's the truth.
They'll catch him soon.
Any time now.
What makes you so certain?
When a man can kills you or me, that's one thing.
But when a copper gets killed, that's another story.
Then all the other coppers realize maybe they're next.
They won't rest till the murderer is caught.
See?
What will you have, sir?
Same as usual.
All right.
Don't even know what this creature is.
Man, beast or devil.
Well, I know I shan't run out alone again.
He's mad.
Unbalanced somehow.
Don't you agree?
Possibly.
Probably.
But there's something else about this.
Something obvious.
Something right in front of us.
You see, when there's something right before our eyes, we don't stop to ask how it got there.
Like the ham in that sandwich.
It's just there.
We don't think of it at all.
Much less stop to say, "How did it get there?"
How did it get there, by the by?
Well, somebody put it there, I dare say.
Yes.
That's right.
Somebody did.
Sergeant?
Is that you, Sergeant?
Oh, it's you.
Yes.
Well, seen anything of the murderer?
No, nor has anybody else.
I doubt if they ever will.
Oh, I don't know.
I've been thinking about it and an idea came to me just now.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Came to me all of a sudden, just a little while ago.
Made me feel as though we've been blind.
It's been staring us in the face.
Oh, has it?
Well, if you're so sure, why not give us the benefit of this idea?
I'm going to.
We were talking in the bar now about things that are staring us in the face.
Things that we don't think about to question.
Like the ham in a sandwich, you know.
We never wonder how it got there.
But somebody said, "Well, if it's there,
"somebody must have put it there. "
And that was it.
Now, if four people have been murdered, somebody must have been there to murder them, you see.
Well, of course someone was there.
We all know that.
Question is, who?
Yes.
The answer seems so simple now.
But there's one thing I don't understand.
One little thing I'd like to clear up.
I mean, the motive.
As man to man, tell me, Sergeant Ottermole,
just why did you kill those inoffensive people?
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Newspaperman,
I don't know.
In fact, I've been worried about it myself.
But, I've got an idea, just like you.
Everybody knows we can't control the workings of our minds, don't they?
Ideas come without our asking.
But everybody's supposed to be able to control the workings of his body.
Why?
Our arms, our legs, our heads, aren't completely ours.
We don't make them.
And couldn't ideas come into our limbs, just like ideas come into our minds?
Huh?
Couldn't ideas live in nerve and muscle as well as in the brain?
And couldn't it be that parts of our bodies aren't really us?
And ideas could come into those parts all of a sudden like ideas come into
my hands?
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Yes.
I never saw anything so quick or anyone so strong.
I thought I was done for, for a moment.
I know.
We were following as close as we dared.
It's a good thing we got the constable here in time.
The sergeant.
I can't believe it.
His hands were like iron.
Yes, his hands.
Did you hear what he said about his hands?
He said ideas came into his hands.
He must have been insane.
Yes
I suppose so.
Ow!
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'll tie it myself.
It won't take long.
I'm sure I'll be ready by next week's show.
And you be ready, too.
I hope you'll excuse me for not being ready at show time but my watch is slow.
As a matter of fact, it hasn't even gotten here yet.
First, I would like to announce a change in our program.
Shakespeare's Hamlet will not be presented tonight.
We don't feel it suitable to show in the home.
All those corpses, you know.
Instead, we're offering a story entitled
"The Hands of Mr. Ottermole. "
Most of our stories have taken place in the United States or one of the other colonies.
But tonight we offer a new locale.
"The Hands of Mr. Ottermole"
is laid in a far-off land of mystery and enchantment.
England.
And now suppose you continue squinting at this little screen while I slip into something more uncomfortable.
No, thank you.
Well, here I am.
Is that you, Herbert?
Well, now, who did you think it was, your gentleman friend?
Oh, Herbert!
Kippers.
You know, I've been having a discussion with myself all the way home.
"Wonder what she's got for tea. " I said,
"Haddock or herring.
"I bet its haddock, but I hope not. "
Kippers would be just the thing on a night like this.
Well, all right, then.
Your slippers are in here waiting for you.
Now, that's a blessing.
My feet are killing me.
Half a mo'.
There's someone at the door.
Oh, hello!
Won't you come in?
We're just going to sit down for tea.
We're going to have kippers, you know.
Herbert?
Here!
I said stop it!
Ain't it terrible?
Both of them...
Here, let me...
... and not a single witness.
Let me see, can't you.
Now then, now then, now then, keep back, everybody.
Outside the house, now.
Petersen!
Petersen.
Now, you have to keep it quiet.
Come on.
Outside, outside.
Come on, get back there.
I don't know you!
Mr. Whybrow's nephew from down the way.
Oh, all right, come in, come in.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go on home, go on home.
Well, now, you say you're his nephew.
Yes, I live down the road a piece.
Who did it?
Well, now, we don't know about that as yet.
I'm finished here, Sarge.
I searched the back premises, nothing there.
Not a trace.
All right.
See if you can find anyone nearby who saw anything or heard anything unusual.
Right-o!
Now, come on.
Get back.
What happened?
They were strangled, we know that much.
But as to who did it, that's something else again.
I was passing nearby and I saw the door open.
So I looked in and there they were, just like that.
Dead.
And not a few minutes before I found them either.
But no sign of who did it, and no sign of a struggle or anything like that.
Would your uncle keep any sums of money about the place?
Or anything of value like?
Not that I know of.
I'm sure that he didn't have no sums of money to amount to much.
I could swear to that.
Very well.
Would you take a look about the place, see if there's anything missing?
Or anything at all out of the way?
You know, not like it ought to be.
Yes, all right.
Well, you didn't hear anything at all in here?
Did you hear him come home or go into his house?
Call out to anybody?
No sound of a struggle?
Nothing at all, eh?
No, not a thing.
Me and the missus was in the back, you see, having our tea.
Say, what kind of a chap was he?
Did you know him at all well?
Lived next door to him for five years now.
Very quiet, dependable sort of fellow.
Everybody liked him.
Mmm-hmm.
Can't find a thing in the house that don't look everyday and proper.
Not anywhere at all.
Well, I didn't think you would.
There weren't any fingerprints, were there?
No.
Not a sign.
Ah, that'll be the ambulance.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
There's just no reason to it.
Oh, there's a reason all right.
Must be.
They're dead, aren't they?
Sergeant, remember me?
I'm from The Guardian, I'd like to...
How did you get here so quickly?
I live around here.
But what I'd like to know is...
Sorry no time for the press just at present, Sir.
You'll have to wait a bit.
Now, now.
Now then, stand back.
I am sorry, gentleman, that is all the information we have for you just at present.
You've read the papers, I suppose?
Yes, I have.
It's kicked up an awful stir.
The senseless wantonness of these killings has everybody talking about them.
I've been told to stick with this story till it's solved.
So have I.
So you better produce some results, eh, Sergeant.
You've made no progress so far.
What we might know and what we're able to tell you are two different things.
However, you may say that we expect to have something definite...
To report at an early date.
No, I'm afraid the public won't accept that in this case, Sergeant.
Now, see here, this only happened the night before last.
You can't expect us to nab the man instantly when he left no clues at all.
So you have made no progress then?
Now, wait a minute, I didn't say that.
I didn't say that at all.
You're twisting my words.
Buy a flower.
Buy a flower for your young lady, Sir,
I ain't sold none all day.
All right.
Nearly closing time, Ben.
You were a bit late last night, we can't have that, you know.
Don't worry, Sarge.
We ride in the dark tonight.
Last call for drinks.
Well, call that fair?
I don't.
I don't call that fair.
After all, we've only had four days.
These things can't be done overnight, you know.
That's an editorial, old boy.
No good to complain to me about it.
I just have to turn in a story each day.
And you must confess, you haven't given me very much to turn in so far.
You or Scotland Yard.
Now, look here, you can't expect us to tell you every move we make, you know.
Then the criminal would know what we're doing, too, wouldn't he?
Come on now, Sergeant, we're talking about progress and you can't report anything because you haven't made any.
Have you?
Time, gentleman.
Please drink up and pay up.
All out.
By the way,
I find it remarkable how you gentleman of the press arrived at the spot so quickly.
Well, I'm a roving reporter now and I...
That's where I happened to be roving at the time.
Good night, Sergeant.
Good night.
Time's up.
All right.
Buy a flower for the young lady, sir?
Good evening, Sir.
It's been a long day.
Business ain't been so good.
And I was having a bit of a rest
Good morning, Sergeant.
Have you seen The Guardian?
No, and I don't want to.
Thank you very much.
So, you've made no progress with the old flower woman either.
Mr. Summers, how about a cup of tea?
Thanks.
A little sugar if you please.
You know, I had a theory about this at the start.
The Whybrows, that is.
Since it seemed like there was no reason for killing them at all,
I thought maybe the reason why there seemed to be no reason was because there isn't any reason.
You see what I mean?
He made a mistake, thought he was killing somebody else, went to the wrong house or something.
Eh, Sarge?
Well, of course it's no good now.
He wouldn't make two mistakes.
And now we've got two sets of killing and no reason at all.
Doesn't seem to make sense somehow.
Wonder what the motive could be?
Maybe there wasn't any.
Oh, there was a motive all right.
You can count on that.
There has to be a motive, you know.
No, no.
No.
There've been crimes, murders, without motives before.
Oh, come now, you don't mean no motive at all?
That's right, there have.
Neil Cream for one.
And William Palmer for another, eh, Sergeant?
That's right.
He was another.
I say, if you're up against a man like that, you're in real trouble, aren't you?
Never know where he'll strike next or when.
Or what he's like or anything.
Let's visualize a man.
He appears ordinary, but yet he isn't.
Nothing so old-fashioned as a conscience bothers him, yet he has three murders to his credit.
And I'm sure he's sitting somewhere now calmly drinking a cup of tea, just as we are
and smiling to himself because the police are such fools.
He's got something to smile about and that's a fact.
But he isn't an Englishman.
He's a foreigner.
They're all around this district, you know.
Why not an Englishman?
'Cause we British haven't got the nature for a thing like that.
Nor the talent for it either.
One of these foreign johnnies.
They know tricks that we've never even heard of and wouldn't practice if we had.
Well, whoever he is and wherever he's from, he's a man to reckon with.
There's no escaping that.
You can't admire him certainly.
But you have to admit he's clever.
Do you realize what he's done?
Yes.
He strangled three helpless, innocent people, that's what.
Oh, it's much more than that.
Have you been around this district lately?
The people only talk about one subject.
The children aren't allowed to play in the streets.
Women do their shopping before dark and bolt their windows and doors at night.
They watch anxiously for their husbands' return from work.
Men eye each other, even familiar faces, and think, "It might be him. "
This one man with a pair of hands has terrified this whole community and made them realize that the laws are powerful only so long as they are obeyed.
The police are potent so long as they are feared.
You seem so positive we're dealing with just one man.
Would you say there were two men, Sergeant, like that?
Two men in the same place and at the same time?
No, I'll own it seems unlikely.
That's right.
This is a singular man.
A man who comes along once in a lifetime probably.
This one man with one pair of hands has held the entire police force and Scotland Yard helpless with nowhere to turn.
Aye, he's done that.
Part of it, at least.
But as for having us powerless, with nowhere to turn, that's something else again.
It is?
You have your informers out, I'm sure, in the pubs and the tea rooms.
But aside from that, what have you done?
What can you do?
He's made some mistake somewhere.
Or he'll make one.
You can bank on that.
And we'll be watching, never fear.
Maybe he won't, though.
What then?
He will.
They always do.
Hmm, but they don't.
Now that's the thing.
What about Dr. Crippen?
And George Joseph Smith?
You've heard of them, Sergeant?
Aye, I have.
Well, those people killed and were discovered only years afterwards by accident or belated confession.
Now, there must be many others who have never been discovered.
Now, you say the murderer is always caught because all the ones we know of have been caught.
But think of the others.
The ones we don't know about yet.
You seem to have made a great study of crime, Mr. Newspaperman.
I have.
Tell me, Sergeant, in your professional opinion, do you really believe you can catch this man if he doesn't want you to?
Oh, aye.
We'll catch him.
Because we have to.
We've doubled our force the day after the first murder.
And now we have four men where we usually have one.
We are just hoping he will try again.
If he does, we've got him.
