Jeon Ji-hyun Cha Tae-hyun
My Sassy Girl
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
Here we go.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
I need to hit on her.
Hello?
Who is this?
Keep quiet!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
Still there?
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Honey!
She call him honey!
What are you doing!
You handle this!
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770...
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
I told you.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please, forgive me just this once.
Please, forgive me.
How are you?
Please, please, save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please, just for once!
Please...
See you!
Answer now!
Boss told you!
What brought you here?
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, he told you... you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
What happened to your sweater?
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
An engineering major.
Study?
My parents can prove that.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
My goals?
You know now?
You got it.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry Jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
You were drunk, so...
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
Would you believe that, too?
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
Then are you hitting on me?
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
I know what that means.
Are you rich?
How much will you give us?
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Eat something else!
Mind your own business.
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Show me your ID.
You, too.
Show it, now.
This sucks.
No matter how pretty she is,
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Come on!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please, stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But, mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What is it?
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
Lee Hyung-chul.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu Seol-soo.
Professor.
How about a break?
Go where?
He called roll, right?
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
Pretty?
A girl needs to act pretty.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
What?
No, no!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
Their family line is broken up now.
But, you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please, bury me with my loving friend.
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
I must be hurt still.
How deep could it be?
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly there is a runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Drink till we die.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me...
Oh, my gosh!
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
I decided to take revenge on her.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Want some of this?
Try it.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Thank you.
You bastard!
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Of course not, dad.
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this.
*^____________.^*
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
Eh?
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
Wait till I catch you.
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Got it?
Yes.
Is that a real gun?
How are you two related?
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
Go ahead and apologize!
Alright.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
Am I foolish?
I know.
I know, too.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
It means prison.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Oh, right.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
Screw you!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Wait!
Hey, soldier!
I mean... sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
Stop this, and go back to the base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
Hey!
Got it?
Screw it.
Shit!
Thank you.
What?
No, I said that to save you.
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
I hope you believe in me.
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
Oh, hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
I know her.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
Looks fun, huh?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
Gyeon-woo?
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup!
The heroine becomes a King.
King Jung-jo.
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
I think this is unfair.
No.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Better slap me on the cheek.
All right.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
Nope.
I want it to be blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea?
And why you were born here?
I was born before you.
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
Want a massage?
How can a guy wear heels?
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
Forget it.
Okay!
Really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
Wait.
Eh?
Gee...
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
Why is he stupid?
What has gotten into you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
That George Winston song.
Pachelbel Canon?
Yeah, that song.
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
Still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
Oh, my God!
A burglar!
Help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
What on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Really?
Bring a lot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
Hey!
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gee!
Feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Gonna be a big deal.
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Taxi!
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Sir?
Right.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
After that day, she never calls me.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo.
I heard a lot about you.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him...
Yes.
Hey, listen!
A man likes something more feminine.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
Good luck to you.
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
...please, use the next train.
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo!
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wish we can get serious.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo!
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
Okay?
We can meet two years later.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Should we go together?
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
Overtime
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
Got to make use of my time.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yup!
Excuse me.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
People are dead or alive.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
This is Gyeon-woo.
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Jeun Jee-hyun Cha Tae-hyun
MY SASSY GIRL
Here we go.
One, two...
Gyeon-woo:
Wait a minute.
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo:
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
Friend 1 :
Gyeon-woo:
Friend 2:
Hey, asshole.
Friend 1 :
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
Gyeon-woo:
You irritate me!
Gyeon-woo:
Give me a break, asshole.
Gyeon-woo:
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Friend 1 :
Who are you kidding?
Friend 2:
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
I need to hit on her.
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard.
Oh, mom...
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo:
Keep quiet!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
Gyeon-woo:
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
Still there?
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo:
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Gyeon-woo:
Uncle does, too.
Hey!
Gyeon-woo:
I know the type she likes.
Gyeon-woo:
Tell her no thanks.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elder!
Ugh!

Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
Tell me the truth, idiot.
Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
My Yorkshire Terrier.
Bitch.

In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.

Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Gyeon-woo:
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo:
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Gyeon-woo:
Finally, she likes to write.
Gyeon-woo:
Encourage her.
Gyeon-woo.
Station attendant:
Step backward on the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:...please use the next train.
Station attendant:
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wish we can get serious.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
If you hear, answer me.
Gyeon-woo:
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo!
Did you bring your letter?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Gyeon-woo:
Should we go together?
Gyeon-woo:
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
Overtime
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
Got to make use of my time.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
No one knows when she will come.
Gyeon-woo:
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Old man:
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Old man:
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Old man:
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
Old man:
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
Old man:
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Old man:
like what?
If we were destined to meet,
Old man:
Know what fate is?
Old man:
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
Old man:
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
Old man:
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Old man:
look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
Old man:
People are dead or alive.
Old man:
Old man:
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
Old man:
It was split into two.
Old man:
But this young man felt sorry for it.
Old man:
During this spring,
Old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
Old man:
When he planted the tree,
Old man:he asked me if it look the same.
Old man:
He said that someone would be sad if it died,
Old man:so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
Please, call again.
Hi.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
Gyeon-woo:
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
This is Gyeon-woo.
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,
Heard you came to Bupyung often,
Go out with him.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
Jeun Jee-hyun Cha Tae-hyun
MY SASSY GIRL
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
Here we go.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
I need to hit on her.
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard. /Oh, mom...
Keep quiet!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
Still there?
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Honey!
She call him honey!
What are you doing!
You handle this!
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
I told you.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please forgive me just this once.
Please forgive me.
How are you?
please, please save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please just for once!
Please...
See you!
Answer now!
Boss told you!
What brought you here?
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
What happened to your sweater?
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
An engineering major.
Study?
My parents can prove that.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
My goals?
You know now?
You got it.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
You were drunk, so...
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
Would you believe that, too?
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
Then are you hitting on me?
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
I know what that means.
A motel?
Are you rich?
How much will you give us?
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Eat something else!
Mind your own business.
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Show me your ID.
You, too.
Show it, now.
This sucks.
No matter how pretty she is,
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
How dare you?
Come on!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What!
What is it?
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
Then talk like friends. /Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
Lee Hyung-chuI.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu SeoI-soo.
Professor.
How about a break?
Go where?
He called roll, right?
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
Pretty?
A girl needs to act pretty.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
What?
No, no!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.
Shower?
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
Their family line is broken up now.
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
I must be hurt still.
How deep could it be?
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Really?
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
Are you free?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly say there is an accident of runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Drink till we die.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me...
Oh my gosh!
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Oh no.
Oh, thank you. /No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
I decided to take revenge on her.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Get up, bastard!
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
What officer?
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Hey.
Want some of this?
Try it.
No. / Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Keep quiet!
Thank you.
You bastard!
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Go to bed now. /You too, dad.
All right, good night!
Of course not, dad.
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Go to sleep. /Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * ¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Jump over here?
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
Eh?
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
Wait till I catch you.
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Got it?
Yes.
Answer quietly!
Is that a real gun?
Wanna see?
How are you two related?
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
Go ahead and apolize!
Alright.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Tell me the truth, idiot. / Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
I know. I know, too.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
It means prison.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Go!
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Oh, right.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
Screw you!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
Got it?
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Wait!
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
Stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
Hey!
Got it?
Can I go?
Screw it.
Shit!
Thank you.
What?
No, I said that to save you.
Let me go, instead?
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
I hope you believe in me.
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
Oh, hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
I like her that way. /What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
He he he
I know her.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
Looks fun, huh?
Another one?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
Gyeon-woo?
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
I think this is unfair.
No.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Better slap me on the cheek.
AII right.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
Nope.
I want it to be blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
And why you were born here?
I was born before you.
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
Want a massage?
How can a guy wear heels?
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
Forget it.
Okay!
really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
Phew~ /Catch me, honey~!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
Wait.
Eh?
Gee~
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
Why is he stupid?
What has gotten in to you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
hello?
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
That George Winston song.
PacheIbeI Canon?
Yeah, that song.
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
Oh my God!
A burglar!
help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
really?
Bring a Iot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
Hey!
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gee!
feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Gonna be a big deal.
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Taxi!
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time,
She looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Sir?
Right.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
Actually, on the way here. / Forget it.
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
After that day, she never calls me.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Same here. / Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo.
I heard a lot about you.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
Yes.
Hey, listen!
Man likes something more feminine.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
please use the next train.
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wish we can get serious.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo!
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
We can meet two years later.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Should we go together?
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
Over time
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
Got to make use of my time.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yu~p!
Excuse me.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
People are dead or alive.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
This is Gyeon-woo.
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Jeun Jee-hyun Cha Tae-hyun
MY SASSY GIRL
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
Here we go.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
I need to hit on her.
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard. /Oh, mom...
Keep quiet!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
Still there?
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Honey!
She call him honey!
What are you doing!
You handle this!
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
I told you.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please forgive me just this once.
Please forgive me.
How are you?
please, please save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please just for once!
Please...
See you!
Answer now!
Boss told you!
What brought you here?
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
What happened to your sweater?
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
An engineering major.
Study?
My parents can prove that.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
My goals?
You know now?
You got it.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
You were drunk, so...
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
Would you believe that, too?
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
Then are you hitting on me?
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
I know what that means.
A motel?
Are you rich?
How much will you give us?
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Eat something else!
Mind your own business.
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Show me your ID.
You, too.
Show it, now.
This sucks.
No matter how pretty she is,
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
How dare you?
Come on!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What!
What is it?
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
Then talk like friends. /Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
Lee Hyung-chuI.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu SeoI-soo.
Professor.
How about a break?
Go where?
He called roll, right?
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
Pretty?
A girl needs to act pretty.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
What?
No, no!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.
Shower?
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
Their family line is broken up now.
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
I must be hurt still.
How deep could it be?
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Really?
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
Are you free?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly say there is an accident of runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Drink till we die.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me...
Oh my gosh!
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Oh no.
Oh, thank you. /No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
I decided to take revenge on her.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Get up, bastard!
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
What officer?
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Hey.
Want some of this?
Try it.
No. / Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Keep quiet!
Thank you.
You bastard!
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Go to bed now. /You too, dad.
All right, good night!
Of course not, dad.
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Go to sleep. /Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * ¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Jump over here?
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
Eh?
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
Wait till I catch you.
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Got it?
Yes.
Answer quietly!
Is that a real gun?
Wanna see?
How are you two related?
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
Go ahead and apolize!
Alright.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Tell me the truth, idiot. / Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
I know. I know, too.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
It means prison.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Go!
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Oh, right.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
Screw you!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
Got it?
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Wait!
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
Stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
Hey!
Got it?
Can I go?
Screw it.
Shit!
Thank you.
What?
No, I said that to save you.
Let me go, instead?
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
I hope you believe in me.
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
Oh, hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
I like her that way. /What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
He he he
I know her.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
Looks fun, huh?
Another one?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
Gyeon-woo?
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
I think this is unfair.
No.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Better slap me on the cheek.
AII right.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
Nope.
I want it to be blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
And why you were born here?
I was born before you.
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
Want a massage?
How can a guy wear heels?
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
Forget it.
Okay!
really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
Phew~ /Catch me, honey~!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
Wait.
Eh?
Gee~
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
Why is he stupid?
What has gotten in to you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
hello?
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
That George Winston song.
PacheIbeI Canon?
Yeah, that song.
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
Oh my God!
A burglar!
help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
really?
Bring a Iot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
Hey!
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gee!
feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Gonna be a big deal.
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Taxi!
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time,
She looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Sir?
Right.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
Actually, on the way here. / Forget it.
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
After that day, she never calls me.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Same here. / Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo.
I heard a lot about you.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
Yes.
Hey, listen!
Man likes something more feminine.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
please use the next train.
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wish we can get serious.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo!
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
We can meet two years later.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Should we go together?
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
Over time
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
Got to make use of my time.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yu~p!
Excuse me.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
People are dead or alive.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
This is Gyeon-woo.
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met an old man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.

In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
The heroine becomes a king.

Gyeon-woo:
Why is the heroine always from the future?

Gyeon-woo:
If you do, ask him to take you.

So I play until I win.
Gyeon-woo:

Station attendant:
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I Iooked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wish we can get serious.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
could someone hear me from there?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
If you hear, answer me.
Gyeon-woo:
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo.
Gyeon-woo!
Did you bring your letter?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Gyeon-woo:
should we go together?
Gyeon-woo:
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
Overtime
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
Got to make use of my time.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
No one knows when she will come.
Gyeon-woo:
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
while I was dating you, I met his mother often.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
old man:
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
old man:
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
old man:
really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
old man:
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
old man:
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
old man:
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
old man:
Know what fate is?
old man:
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
old man:
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
old man:
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
old man:
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
old man:
people are dead or alive.
old man:
old man:
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
old man:
It was split into two.
old man:
But this young man felt sorry for it.
old man:
During this spring,
old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
old man:
When he planted the tree,
old man:he asked me if it look the same.
old man:
He said that someone would be sad if it died,
old man:so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
please, call again.
Hi.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in england?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
feel better?
Yes.
A Iot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
Gyeon-woo:
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
This is Gyeon-woo.
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,
Heard you came to Bupyung often,
Go out with him.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
Patient has Pneumothorax but is trapped under the panel
Send the emergency unit here now
Help me!
BP 170/100, pulse 100, SAO270
Help!
Stay where you are!
Breathing is steady, BP 170/80 pulse 80, SAO295
No hospital is like that!
Ridiculous!
Dr. Wong!
Thanks!
This place requires forms for everything
This is for first visit, this is for blood test and this is for X-ray
These two are the most important
Claim forms for meal and transportation
The hospital has a liability system so write intelligibly then no one can sue you for malpractice
What?
I...
Ho Kau Kei
What happened to him?
Got hit by lightning
What would you do, Dr. Ho?
Take his blood pressure and SAO2
Check his optic nerve for any damage
Check for facial palsy
If he died in the A E, there is report to write and maybe a law suit to settle
We should send him away
You know where to?
Surgery!
Dr. Ma is on duty there
The only one left is the old maid at General Medicine
Take him away!
No internal injury, Surgery!
This is what a lightning victim look like
God will punish you for doing bad things
Stop explaining yourself!
Forget it!
Take him to Orthopedics
Why is he here if his bones are fine?
Surgery!
He was just there
Then General Medicine
He was there too
Take him back to the A E
How about that hemorrhoids patient
You sent here last time?
Your department has openings you should treat everyone!
My diagnosis comes from careful thinking and examination
He has no fractures, not even a spondylitis
How about his bone density level?
Time to leave!
Left-over from the last shift push him aside
He looks familiar
Every dying old man looks just like this
Send him up
Move!
It stinks!
Old man, elevator maintenance, take a breather
I only did good deeds, nothing bad
When the atmosphere acquires sufficient electricity
A discharge of electricity will strike an object on the ground
Those people have no sense
This is all I can do
Brown-nosers!
This is the reality:
You kiss ass to those about you
How many doctors are actually impartial and committed?
Go on hitting me if you like, Sir Ho
I can take it
Order something else!
When did he last eat?
Call for help!
AMI!
He smells!
Well done!
I feel itchy just by the brief contact
Observe carefully, girl.
This is an example of medical ethics!
What a pity!
She barely touched her steak
With little sugar
Are you okay, mister?
You all right?
He was choking.
Had no pulse and heart beat
I performed CPR.
I just had the car cleaned!
Let me...
Get in
8 years ago, I came to the hospital for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, nice body too
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes up 1/3 of the human body
If we cut 1 inch lower, her pants will hide the scar
Difficulty is not an issue
I became a doctor because of what you said
But look at you now, look at your hair!
And now you drive a Volvo, afraid you may die?
I really miss you driving your GTR and your spiky hair-do
That gets him going!
Sir Ho, someone attacked you?
Who did?
I started the fight
The 7F Management should go to hell!
They only wanted my money, not my suggestions
So I attacked them with Shaolin Kung-Fu!
They still tried to fight back
I knocked them down with the Shadow Kick
I beat them under the ground
I dare them to talk back at me
What are you doing?
Plugging your tubes back
I believe in you.
Okay, who do you have in mind?
Nothing at this moment
Say it
Where are you going?
Who is it?
Who made this mess?
Accident at a construction site
Fracture in the left thigh, multiple lacerations
Conscious Index 10, BP 10/50
Pulse 110 1, 2, 3
Cross match, CBP, ECG, SAO2
Everything ready
Forceps!
Hypodermoclysis, units of unmatched blood
Blood plasma full rate, check for any internal bleeding
I need a hand!
A shot of ampoules, Defibrillator!
200!
Clear!
I had it, it was all right
Did you watch TV last night?
The show was so lame!
Give me a coffee
Any sugar?
A little
Listen to the radio now
Forceps!
I need a hand!
200!
Clear!
Should we go find him?
Rescue Center
Rectification
Emergency Check-up
Supersonic Welding
Give me a 23
Brake fluid 200cc, engine oil liters
Battery water 0cc accumulator plate 10cc
Clear!
Start the engine!
Joe!
How is it coming?
I welded back the chassis
How many more years can the car go?
The parts I repaired should give you another 10 years
Thank you!
Joe!
Prepare the Rescue Center
Just this once!
Hurry!
Leave
Damage all over.
Rocker arm is wasted so is the ball bearing the suspension
Get me a screw, and remove the connecting rod
It hurts
I really made up my mind, trust me!
You never follow through with anything in your life
We gave our resignation when the hospital demanded reform
But you handed in a Christmas card!
Stay there!
8 years ago, I came to the hospital for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, good body
Her life will be meaningless1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes of 1/3 of the human body
If we cut one inch lower, her pants can hide the scar
But the operation will be more difficult!
Difficulty is not the issue
I became a doctor because of what you said
A good doctor like you repairing cars?
You have to fix my car it belongs to my boss
I like saving cars more than saving lives
What happened?
This place looks just like an A E
So where is your heart at?
Air compression 0%, get me a pump and a drill
You will come back!
You have to help me out
You said last time I was the reason you became a doctor
Yeah
Back there you said it was because of Joe
Yeah
So who really inspired you?
What matters is who I will marry
What are you talking about?
That time when I underwent the operation
I had a crush on you guys and wanted to marry you
I hope you can tell me what you think
Say something!
You first, Benz
You know the answer already
Are you for it, Mitsubishi?
The girl made some good points
When she pulled down her panty
Stop crying!
Irresponsible!
Calm down!
This is a garage after all
Joe has been a doctor all his life!
Go back, Joe
Thanks
Thanks
Someone attacked you again?
Who did?
No good!
I started the fight!
So I attacked them using the Mantis Stance
Signit!
I fought very hard to get this
Plus the Management Rats are spying on us
What?
Those Rats again?
Sure!
Signit!
After being struck by lightning last month at the Peak
Philanthropist Sir Ho was found at the same place this morning
He was burnt and his condition was critical
Police believes that Sir Ho returned to the Peak for Kung-fu training
When lightning hit him again
This is worse than last time!
Sir Ho
Poor old man got stuck by lightning twice
Maybe we should
No!
We have to fulfill it for him!
How?
Sir Ho manages to stay alive
He kept his promise, and so should we!
Thwart their plan
His face is pale, must be anemic
What a pity, working in dark could result in amblyopia
Sorry, sorry!
Good morning!

No unexcused absence
We have to go now, bye!
Bye!

No phone calls during operation
Hello?
Meeting adjourned
Hold there!
You are new here, so listen carefully:
Use the first urinal to finish business, not the other ones
Cleaning all of them is too much work, trying to kill me?
You clean up your own spots!
Meeting adjourned!
You call this a hospital?
Yeah!
Canteen serves cold coffee soda machine dispenses warm drinks
Does it work?
The stock you
Recommended lost all values
He said to hold on to them
How is it, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything we can
Take it away!
How can you revive the dead?
I just unplugged the instruments
No breathing, no heartbeat
This is against cost effectiveness
Be aware...
Be aware
Terrible, more ribs are cracked
He should let the guy rest in peace
Yeah ...but an important reminder:
According to the Service Agreement 300!
Every patient gets 5 minutes of resuscitation procedure
This is a BBQ.
I can smell the char
The mortician will have a hard time touching up the body
One unit of Type O negative is $200
One injection is $1000
Every pack of cotton balls is $30
More cotton
He should at least show respect for the family
Over-budget, overtime, over-budget, overtime
Put him on Dopamine
Loser!
Bastard!
Are you done?
Hurry up!
I love you!
Why not?
A rival!
What?
What are you talking about?
No!
You have it all wrong.
Like I said
Said what?
You remember who said it?
Either you or I
Good memory
Of course
What are you doing?
How?

Will that include many meaningless chores?
The more meaningless the better!

Go for it
Get up!

They responded!
I love you!
Wait!
What are you doing?
My car!
Life comes first!
Let me move my car first!
Let me move my car first!
You hit my car!
Calm down
Tell me your problem
Too late!
I came here for Appendectomy, but had my sperm duct removed
Then a bad blood transfusion destroyed my liver
During liver transplant bad oxygen destroyed my lung years later and my duodenum is still not removed instead my body is all messed up
My boss fired me, my wife left me
My existence is meaningless!
No, nobody will care
Give us a little time
We are trying to make changes
This place will turn into a caring and responsible hospital
Really?
Caring?
Pay up!
I have no money
Stop making excuses
You hit my car, I want $30,000 for the damages
$30,000, are you kidding?
You switched lane without signaling
A guy jumped down, what can I do?
Whatever!
Pay for the damages!
Cross match, CBP, full-bodied X-ray!
Saline full rate, uncross match units!
Get a drill, and diathermy
What color do you want?
What?
Yellow is for one-month approval
Red is for one-week approval
Blue is for next-day approval
When do you need the supplies?
Right now!
You can submit a white form to Administration or a black one to the Highest Management
Bring it back to the 2nd floor!
Sterilize them
Life comes first, hurry!

People would think your brother came back from the dead!
You gave us a scare!

Fixing our cars, I think
They are pretty decent people
They are admirable we look insignificant in comparison

Take him to the Psychiatric
Cleopatra loved them.
Cassanova lived for them.
The quest for the ultimate aphrodisiac is as old as the human race itself.
Love aids.
Watch as we try it.
Stephen Schneider, known to his friends as Schnitzy is a writer living in New York City.
At 49, he feels he is running against time.
I was seeing this great girl a ballroom dance instructor named Jamie, she taught me to tango and fox trot it was really quite cute and we were together 5 or 6 years and then a few years ago we broke up
and I felt pretty bad I have to say for a few years
Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love inspired the word aphrodisiac.
Aphrodisiacs are things said to arouse or intensify sexual desire or performance.
For Schnitzy, it began with some advice from a friend.
I went up to my old college Ithaca college, saw my old friend Amy who I went to college with, long frizzy redhaired gal, burns candles, plays the dulcimer, just a whole different kind of person.
aphrodisiac world.
From time immemorial people have done just about everything in pursuit of better sex...
Cleopatra, it was said, drove Mark Antony out of his mind by mixing honey and almonds and applyingg the tantalizing paste to her most private parts.
Casanova was reputed to eat dozens of oysters a day and it is said he once seduced a vestal virgin by sliding an oyster from his lips to hers.
And the ancient sex manual the Kama Sutra, suggests milk and honey, enhanced with the testicles of a ram for a guaranteed night of passion.
The tradition of using libido enhancers may be over five thousand years old,
but is there any truth behind the folklore?
But researchers are now finding that some do stimulate more than the imagination.
One popular substance that has been eaten, sniffed and smoked all because of its reputed aphrodisiac properties is the bark of Yohimbe a West African tree.
A series of studies found that Yohimbine, the active ingredient in Yohimbe did raise erections in men by increasing blood flow to the penis.
And with the Yohimbe you wanna take vitamin C -1000 milligrams to help in case you have a nauseous feeling.
It enhances the properties.
Oh, OK, whatever properties I can enhance, the better.
They say on the box that it will take 8 hours to work.
Eight hours?
!
So you have to brew it in the morning.
And how long does it last just so I git my timing down?
So I tried one form of it, a powdered form and basically
I just got sick you know I was nauseous for two hours.
Yohimbe works in several different ways.
One of the ways is to increase circulation and the other way is to stimulate the nervous system.
It does however have some downsides in that it can stimulate heart rate, raise blood pressure and can make one feel a little anxious, nervous and even a little nauseous, so that, sometimes that may not be the most desirable effect
that you want to have in an aphrodisiac.
So despite its availability as a prescription drug,
Yohimbine is not guaranteed to work and should only be used under the guidance of a physician.
Many of the herbal aphrodisiacs including Yohimbine work by increasing blood flow to the genitals.
These signals prompt the blood vessels in the genitals to dilate, bringing in a rush of blood that inflates the erectile tissue.
The veins then close, preventing blood from flowing out of the organ.
The result... is an erection.
One popular aphrodisiac is Gingko.
It comes from the leaves and nuts of the oldest family of trees- the gingko tree, and has been used in Asia for centuries.
Schnitzy decided to give it a try.
In the last 30 years, 300 studies have given clinical evidence that Gingko can benefit the entire body in addition to having aphrodisiac qualities.
A German study of men with erectile dysfunction found that Gingko restored potency in half of them.
But how does it work?
Ginkgo may work by stimulating the brain to release nitric oxide in the erectile tissue of both men and women.
This causes the blood vessles to widen, more blood flows in and we have an erection.
But the jury is still out on how safe and effective Gingko is.
Hundreds of millions of dollars a year are spent in the pursuit of pleasure and the ingredients of love potions come from all parts of the world.
Each culture finds its own aphrodisiacs, depending on what is locally available.
Desert plants have been used as libido enhancers for centuries.
It is said that North American Indian girls once combined ginseng with snake meat, gelatin and wild columbine then secretly added it to the meals of the young men they wanted as husbands.
One plant that has been used as an aphrodisiac in the Southwest is Damiana, a shrub native to North America.
Chemical analysis shows that it contains substances similar to caffeine that can increase sensitivity in the genitals.
It is also reputed to induce erotic dreams when drunk at bedtime, but Damiana has not been approved by the FD A, so its effectiveness remains anecdotal.
In Asia, there are countless substances believed to have aphrodisiac properties.
Many of these make their way across the globe.
One is a Chinese herb called Yin Ya Wo, otherwise known as Horny Goat Weed.
Randier than goats?
Randier than the goats in other parts of the pasture and they found out they were eating a particular weed and the weed they named Horny Goats Weed.
And it worked for the Chinese shepherds?
Well it worked for their goats I guess they started using it also.
So with all these love aids available, is there any way to figure out which ones will guarantee sexual pleasure?
Researchers have made some progress by ruling out some legendary substances that can do more harm than good.
Spanish fly is perhaps one of the most well known so called love elixirs.
Made from the dried bodies of beetles it works by severely irritating the urinary tract, sending a rush of blood to the genitals.
Today, Spanish Fly is illegal in the US and the FD A warns that it is a poison that can cause death, a high price to pay for better sex.
But the quest for better sex is often costly.
In Asia, animal parts have been used for centuries.
The testicles of bulls and rams were once eaten in the hopes of becoming more verile.
Powdered rhinoceros horns are still used in Asia.
Even though there is no proof that they work as an aphrodisiac.
Although many traditional aphrodisiacs do not have the firm backing of science, some have enjoyed their positive effects.
But whether Yohimbe or Gingko can help your libido, may depend on whether you believe it will.
After Jamie I went for a couple of years and I was miserable then as I started eating oysters and drinking champagne and taking Gingko
I started feeling better and I started meeting more women.
Coincidence?
Legend has it that seafood has been considered an aphrodisiac ever since the mythological Aphrodite was born from the sea.
Hot, spicy, sweet, juicy, words that make you wonder if someone is describing a great meal or a great lover.
Since the beginning of time food has been inextricably linked to our sexuality.
Historically mating rituals involved having a meal or banquet before sex and even today the act of eating is so linked to the act of lovemaking, that sex therapists sometimes prescribe a romantic meal for two, as an effective form of foreplay.
Maria, she loves to eat, so I mean there is something I know
I can be always giving her especially a good, I would say dinner.
And then comes the romance and the sex is where, I can use that and then lure her in.
Frank and Maria met in a Chicago mall two and a half years ago and the chemistry was instant.
Maria works as a bookkeeper and Frank drives a truck and for them, food is often the answer to keeping the flame alive.
He loves whipped cream and so do I, and strawberries and syrup, Oh, yes.
But historically the lure of food as an aphrodisiac has had a lot more to it than the sharing of a romantic meal.
We have historical books that tell us about the use of foods for example in the Kama Sutra, they describe a meal of eggs and onions with cardamom cinnamon, and nutmeg.
If you have that before you meet your lover, your chances of having a better experience are greater.
Before science began exploring how our bodies work, people followed a premise known as the Law of Similarities.
This dictated that what a food looked like determined how and where it could benefit the body.
So if a food looked like genitalia it was bound to be an erotic stimulant.
Legend has it that the Aztecs in ancient Mexico were so impressed with the anatomical likeness of the avocado that they named the food ahuacatl or testicle, and forbade village maidens to set one virginal toe outside while the fruit was being harvested.
Many of the aphrodisiac foods were just thought to be aphrodisiacs because of their appearances like bananas asparagus, carrots because of their phallic appearance.
So it seems the ancients did get it right sometimes, because many of the foods that were considered aphrodisiacs actually have vitamins and minerals that are essential for a good sex life.
One of the most visually suggestive love foods is the oyster.
Oysters are also a good natural source of zinc, a mineral necessary for the production of testosterone, believed to be the sex drive hormone in men and women.
But, some argue that you would have to eat dozens of oysters for them to jump-start your libido.
When it comes to being a hot-blooded lover, the chili pepper may hold the key.
The spicy substance in hot foods called capsaicin causes nerve endings to release substance P, a neurotransmitter that stimulates a burning sensation.
Our pulse is raised and we sweat more just as we do during sex.
Some believe that eating hot foods can also trigger the release of endorphins, body chemicals that give us a natural high.
Used for centuries as an aphrodisiac part of its lure comes from its sensuous melting quality.
It gives one a sense of well being and excitement.
The writer Dorothy Parker has become legendary for sayingg,
I can take one or two at the most.
Aside from the fact that a bit of alcohol reduces our inhibitions, some studies have found that alcohol actually raises testosterone levels in women but not in men.
But drinkers beware.
Chicago Classic Rock Station, CD94.7.
Just give us a call...
And kiss.
Maria and Frank are 2 of the 500 neurologist, Dr. Alan Hirsch has been testing.
I had heard that Dr. Hirsch uses food to enhance the sexual pleasures and stuff and so I was interested in that aspect of it because I thought that maybe we could bring something new into, you know, the bedroom.
I want you to rate how much you liked the kiss, or disliked it.
How sexy you thought it was, how much you liked the way his kiss tasted, how much you desire to have another kiss from him.
Okay.
We began to study using foods as aphrodisiacs because we found that when people lose their sense of smell or taste they develop sexual dysfunction.
So the connection became apparent.
Almost 100 years ago, Sigmund Freud said that in order for us to remain a civilized society we had to repress our sense of smell, otherwise we would walk around sexually excited all the time.
Dr. Hirsch has been testing this theory for over 10 years.
Up to 3,000 test subjects later he has found that certain food smells are so sexually exciting they actually increase penile and vaginal blood flow.
When we inhale an aroma odor molecules enter the nose and stimulate small hairs called cilia to send messages to the brain.
The signals then travel down to the spinal cord, and just like the food and herbal aphrodisiacs, cause blood to rush to the genitals.
And the most arousing smell for women was the licorice candy
Good Plenty.
Women, who have a much more sensitive sense of smell, were more discerning.
But for Maria and Frank, the flavor and aroma defimitely enhanced the sensation.
I forgot about the people in the room.
It was just me and him, you know.
It was just and, it made you it made me feel a little bit you know, wanting him a little more, and then having to stop when they said stop.
Vitamins, minerals and a delicious aroma may enhance a night of passion, but the secret to the ultimate aphrodisiac may lie within the body itself.
The human body is forever surprising and delighting us
and aside from the obvious lures of beauty and seduction, the body itself has its own powerful aphrodisiacs.
These come primarily in the form of two body chemicals- hormones and neurotransmitters.
The hormones testosterone and estrogen are mainly secreted by the sex glands, which form part of the endocrine system.
They are essential for our sex drives.
Some, neurotransmitters, like Norepinephrine and Dopamine are released primarily from the brain and send messages throughout our bodies.
They trigger our sensations of pleasure and arousal.
He turned to Chinese medicine after his high-pressured work environment became too much to bear.
Mike was suffering from stress a condition that affects 75% of Americans.
I think if we look at the effects of stress on health and sexuality overall, stress is probably the most common cause of low libido.
There was no communication, there was no closeness and stuff like that.
And the desire was weaning, it was practically disappearing.
When the body itself loses its own capacity to stir the libido, aphrodisiacs often become more of a necessity.
Determined to get his body up and running again, Mike decided to try acupuncture.
He put his trust in the hands of Chinese herbalist and acupuncturist
Adele Reising.
Oh good it looks so much better.
What I did for Michael was I started him with weekly acupuncture treatments to increase his overall energy.
And in the course of our therapy I asked him if he had low sex drive, and he said he did.
Acupuncture is said to stimulate nerve paths, and some claim this causes the brain to release neurotransmitters which heighten desire.
Others believe acupuncture may also help blood flow.
How you doing Mike?
Great, totally relaxed.
Good.
OK.
By promoting circulation through the use of acupuncture you can help with sex drive because part of what has to happen is the area has to be infused with blood in order for normal sexual function to occur, both for men and women.
According to Mike, weekly sessions of acupuncture and a combination of Chinese herbs including Ginseng have helped put him back on track.
From the very first session with Adele, I brought a list of medications I was taking and she went through them all and she had told me that one of the specific medications
I was taking would have an adverse effect on my intimacy which I,
I totally was having.
And she said one of the benefits of acupuncture that it it flows with everything else and it would make everything come along better than what it was.
And it put the oomph back in to your life.
It put the oomph back, my oomph back with the oomph, oomph.
Our relationship is now more intimate, more enjoyable.
The intimacy has improved to the point where has heightened
Yes, has heightened.
And we have the oneness back again.
Rather, each person has a unique smell print made up of pheromones.
Pheromones are chemical substances released all over the body, but especially from the armpits, the genitals and under our hair.
We are surrounded by clouds of these molecules and leave trails of them as we walk.
It is believed that they are picked up by the noses of other people, who are either consciously or unconsciously attracted to our smell.
They also do other things.
There are alarm pheromones, there are mating pheromones, of course there are courtship type pheromones, there are weaning or suckling pheromones, so they act in many sorts of ways.
Whether or not a pheromone could act as an aphrodisiac in humans
I think is still a little bit of an open question.
Some studies show that there may be a link between pheromones and our sex drives.
In one double blind experiment young women were exposed to either pheromones or a placebo.
During the first three weeks of the test, 36 percent of those receiving the pheromones reported having weekly sex.
By the fourteenth week the number doubled!
But, if pheromones are the source of chemistry between two people who are instantly attracted to each other without knowing why, the perfumes and scents humans can detect could also be considered powerful aphrodisiacs.
Some believe that smell is the sense most closely linked to our sexuality.
Although sight and touch are also essential to our sex drive, their signals must pass through areas of the brain known as the thalamus and the cortex before reaching the limbic lobe.
Aromas however, send signals directly to the limbic lobe provoking a more powerful emotional reaction.
But what happens when we combine the lure of scent with the supposed power of pheromones?
I brought you that Perceive purse spray that you had ordered.
Yes, I need to freshen this up a little, get my mood going a little...
These synthetic pheromones are meant to help relaxation reduce inhibitions and may enhance relationships with friends and lovers.
Oh wait till you see what else I brought.
You gotta be kidding.
Nope, nope
Does it have that same thing?
It has that pheromone thing happening, yup.
But some are skeptical about the effectiveness of pheromone perfumes
The pheromone molecule that they contain or the supposed pheromone molecule that they contain, really has I think has not been tested rigorously or rigorously enough to really know whether it has any activity.
While research into the effectiveness of pheromones continues, there is one part of the body believed to be the center of it all.
I think our brain is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
So many things go into our sexual response-what we smell what we see, what we hear.
If our bodies themselves offer us the most powerful aphrodisiacs, from brain chemicals to natural scents, perhaps good overall health and fitness can help ensure sexual success.
In the last decade, health club membership in America has almost doubled.
But although tight abs and firm thighs may be pleasing to the eye, trying to attain a beautiful body might not be the only reason to have a good workout.
Researchers are finding that regular exercise leads to better sex.
One California study polled 8000 women nationwide.
Of those who did some type of aerobic activity regularly 40% were more easily aroused:
But is this simply because exercise brings increased self-confidence or is exercise provoking any chemical reactions inside our bodies?
Endorphins are primarily found in the pituitary gland in the brain and are distributed throughout the nervous system.
They are thought to be connected to our feelings of euphoria changes in appetite and the release of sex hormones that are essential to our sex drives.
Hello, welcome to the show.
They counsel listeners whose love lives may need a little boost.
We have Maggie on the line
Hi Greg, Hi Karen.
Greg has been a sex therapist for over 30 years and Karen for 15 years.
For them, sex has always been a priority.
10 years ago, Greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a progressive, disabling illness that affects nerve cells in the brain and spine.
Since I figured that MS was going to be time-consuming and energy consuming,
I had to get rid of everything that I figured was unimportant and save my time and energy for the things that were important- so I got rid of everything but sex.
Determined to keep their sex lives vibrant, and to be able to advise their patients and listeners on the latest libido enhancers,
Greg and Karen turned to exercise in their case, the eastern practice of Tantra.
Tantra for us becomes an exercise of both mind and body.
From the body standpoint, it helps us build the energy that we have, and it also helps us, release energy you know that goes into stress and it allows us to gain a relaxation and a joining then of each other.
We think of it as building energy through breath through postures like yoga postures and that this energy that we build is part of our expression of loving of payingg attention to one another of increasing the joy and vitality in our love.
There are two distinct ways to apply exercise to sexuality.
The Western approach is to emphasize the physical by spending hours on the treadmill or lifting weights.
In the ancient cultures of the East however, it is more about the mind and body connection with a very strong focus on sex, so exercises such as Yoga and Tantra were developed.
Like some herbal aphrodisiacs Tantra and Yoga are said to help blood flow.
In yoga there are many exercises that because of the particular posture they will stimulate blood flow to certain organs.
And specific yoga exercises are geared towards improving the function of the ovaries the adrenal glands and the pituitary hypothalamus.
Aside from increasing blood flow to our sex glands, yoga also includes specific exercises that can be used to make sex better.
Some exercises help strengthen the muscles in the pelvic region, while others can help control orgasm and ejaculation.
Karen and Greg practice Tantra every week.
And although science has yet to prove that this type of exercise can directly stimulate the sex glands, many people like Karen and Greg find that regular Tantra does lead to better sex.
Stretching is really one of the best exercises that I can do because it allows me to be flexible.
For Karen and Greg, Tantra proved to be the answer to their sexual dreams, but for others, dance is a great sexual enhancer.
Throughout history, dance has been used in courtship rituals and often as a prelude to sex.
Indeed, dance often has the excitement, release and exhaustion characteristics of sexual climax.
Dance is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
Many of the Latin dances for example are very sensual and very sexual.
Many of the rituals involved in mating in various different civilizations involved dance.
For Karen and Greg, exercise has defimitely helped to enhance their sex lives, but sometimes, we need a prescription to perform.
Vast strides in medical technology have helped to make the issue of sexual performance a 21st century obsession.
While our quest for the perfect aphrodisiac continues, have we replaced the potions of the past with the pharmaceuticals of the future?
Has the art of love become the art of science?
In the United States it is estimated that over 58 million men and women may suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction.
The cause could be physical psychological or both but drug companies are competing to find a cure.
Perhaps one of the most well known pharmaceuticals today is Viagra.
To date over 16 million prescriptions for Viagra have been filled in the United States alone.
But Viagra is just the tip of the iceberg in the medical quest for sexual success.
Erection medication is so popular it is boasting over
$880 million dollars of sales and new treatments continue to hit the market.
But to some, many of these drugs are nothing short of a miracle.
After Greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, he suffered from erectile dysfunction and had to face the reality that medical assistance was needed.
His doctor prescribed Caverject- the first prescription medication approved by the FD A for erectile dysfunction.
For Greg, this meant having an injection before sex.
Caverject and penile injection therapy is not scary at all.
OK.
And we load it in here...
And put this on...
You ready?
Oh yeah.
That banana has no feeling whatsoever.
For over 15 years, the pharmaceutical industry has targeted erectile dysfunction in men.
But now, the race is on to find the magic formula for women.
A recent study conducted by the University of Chicago found that over 40% of women in the United States may suffer from sexual dysfunction.
The result - drugs ranging from estrogen rings to blood flow creams that enhance genital sensation are being developed at a frenzied pace.
The best candidate for medication is a woman who was satisfied with her sexual response at one point in time, and now for whatever physical reason whether it be a pelvic surgery, or menopause or medication, is no longer able to respond as she once could.
This time of life has caused sexuality, the drive that is, to wane a little bit.
One could only imagine that women all over the world at my age are perhaps experiencing the same thing.
One could only imagine that even Sophia Loren must be you know going through this experience as well... 55 year old Petrina Wells is not alone in her concern.
In fact, it is estimated that over 24 million women around the world reach menopause every year.
With aging and menopause, women experience a variety of changes in their sexual function, being increased vaginal dryness increased pain with intercourse, changes in their ability to become aroused, difficulty achieving orgasm, and those changes are primarily due to the change in the hormones.
Unlike many menopausal women around the world who accept their waning sex drive in silence,
They come in stating that they really are troubled and frustrated by their lack of desire.
They want an active sexual relationship with their partner.
Probably in the middle way through that.
Ok, and are you on any hormones now?
I am, yes.
OK.
So are those like estrogen or progesterone?
Has anyone talked to you about testosterone?
Doctors have long been prescribing hormone replacement therapy for men suffering from impotence and women going through menopause, but today testosterone is the one that pharmaceutical companies are targeting as the next best libido prescription.
In the age-old aphrodisiac quest modern medicine is finally offering some alternatives.
For Petrina, the testosterone treatment may offer her the opportunity for many more years of passion with her partner Rusty,
and she will need to follow-up with her doctor to monitor the effects of the medication.
But be it pharmeceuticals or age old aphrodisiacs, the goal remains the same.
So while our quest for passion continues, most people seem to agree, that no plant, potion or pill alone can promise satisfaction.
Perhaps the ultimate aphrodisiac is love itself.
and then enhances love, hey you know
The best aphrodisiac is the decision to be erotic, and knowing yourself well enough to know what kind of stimulation what kind of circumstances, what kind of conditions you need to have met in your own life to be turned on.
So, if somebody feels that they want something, that aphrodisiac is probably going to heighten that sexual thing,
But for the moment I think.
But the thing is, if you got love love is gonna keep that memory all the time.
The ultimate aphrodisiac is love and being with Mike.
You betchya.
in the shop of his father, the upholsterer for the king, Jean-Baptiste Poquelin reads to his brothers and sisters his first comical verses
an actor of the Comedia Italia, Tiberio Fiorelli aka Scaramouche wishes to purchase some accessories
I dream too of playing comedy tonight at 20:00 Pearl Tavern
that night... at the Pearl Taverne

One year after his marriage to Gervaise
Two years later Coupeau is cured
Four years after Virginie takes revenge
The first absinthe
Three years later.
A scene in the pub
Coupeau bets with Lantier to drink eight glasses of brandy whilst the clock strikes eight
Following shortly
Part Three
Two years later Coupeau leaves hospital
He is told that drinking alcohol will prove fatal for him.
Though he can drink a little wine
The revenge of Virginie
She changes the bottle of wine for one of brandy
The End
Government?
Sons of bitches...
Who made it anyway?
...
Since that day... that day...
Shanghai
On that day, I was to die
I set fire to Japanese houses whenever I could
And then I got caught
Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts
Today, we are here to execute the principal offenders, these Chosun people
How reckless and foolish it is to fight against the Great Japanese Empire
Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts
Here are the villains... of political and other sorts... to be publicly executed
They were anarchists
That was how I met them
Look closely
This is Majaal, who makes the bombs and weapons for us
Where are you pointing at?
Black looks good on Sang-Gu!
Like a bell boy at the club
Do you know why we prefer black clothes?
If the socialists are red then anarchists are black
Throughout history we only wore white, a sign of weakness
And we should mourn for our old timers, right?
Wow!
Looking good, huh?
Listen!
Hello
Ling Ling!
Ling Ling Light them up well with the mirror
Why we always have to take our pictures from him?
Ready?
One... two...
Three!
Hey, get up for a minute.
Get up, I said
Try reciting our declaration
People are our principal spirit of revolution
Louder!
People are our principal spirit of revolution
Violence is our only weapon of revolution
With our people, we will overthrow the Japanese rule
With assassination, destruction and rebellion.
We...
We will rebuild our tortured life under Japanese rule
And as a first class society there will be no suppression
Without any, without any oppression to our fellow men,
We will build an ideal Chosun nation...
That day, I was officially accepted into the group
Hi Seregay Hey they sure look silky
My!
Why do girls always like his kind.
Drives me crazy!
Wow!
Drink up!
Those bitches sure know how to roll their hips around
Sang-gu, do you see those Japs, over there?
To the right is Gato, his pawn
In front of him is the cold-hearted Kuboda
When should we kick their butts?
Kaneko-san!
Many foreigners are here
So what if there are?
We can crush those Japs and hide with the French
What are we doing?
The only buffoon here is you.
Cheers!
You idiot!
Seregay consoled his pains with opium
Give us the money now
What are you doing?
We want our opium money
But did you have to...
Seregay!
Hey guys!
What do we have here?
So!
You got a knife?
Get lost!
Come on!
You have a funny hobby
Well, yes, that is...
You seem to turn the pages with perfume
Oh, now what should I do?
I was really saving it up...
I hardly used it...
Who told you to bring me here?
You just wait a bit, okay?
Hey you!
Yesterday you got fancy food and you threw it all up
And now you...
You rotten bastard.
You all right?
Sang-Gu!
Go and get the pictures from the photo shop
Yes, sir
Now eat, okay?
Hello.
How can I help you?
Photos?
Photos!
Wait one minute
Here...
Photos
You should smile
Smile!
No...
Have a cup of tea Yes, sir
Have you scrubbed yourself well?
You could get sick without some scrubbing now and then
Yes sir, I have
I need to scrub off filth
What do you mean?
Please get to the point
A while ago, Han Myung-Gon received some subsidy from Lenin 2 million rubles was delivered from Moscow to Shanghai
But a 1 00,000 rubles of that just disappeared into thin air
You mean, Kim Lib took it?
Kim Ku already killed him
The provisional government thinks that we took it all
All the leftists, including Lee Dong-Hui, Shin Chae-Ho and Kim Won-Bong are all under suspicion
Han Myung-Gon thought it was dangerous to carry it alone
So he entrusted a part of it to some guy
But that guy ran off to Russia to keep it for himself
We finally found him
Kill him and bring back the money
In two months, top Japanese officials will be in Shanghai
Probably conspiring to take the rest of China
Is that so?
Wow!
We finally got a big one for us
Now we can make our names famous in history
I brought a guest.
Please greet him
A Minister of Provisional Government, Mr. Ahn Chang-ho
I already spoke to your leader, Mr. Kim, and I advise you to stop your terrorism from now on
Especially, the foreign settlements are absolutely forbidden
And you want us to just watch those Japs kill our brothers?
Why judge everything only by the things you know?
Thanks to the protection from the foreign settlement officials, thousands of our people can be safe in the French districts
Now the Japs will expand their power into these areas
We have to change our society through enlightenment
The Japs should be hacked to death
Dol-Suk!
Sir!
Let me take care of that damn Governor-General
Our guest is leaving
Show him the way out
You fellows think carefully about what I said
Geez!
Are you sick?
After I leave, you sleep with her
Help me fall out of love
Before a big kill, we always took a picture
Since it could be our last moment alive
One
Two
Three
You know that dancing lady?
Am I right?
But a gun is more reliable than a knife, right?
It depends on how you use it
A Russian hooker went in
She looks expensive
Will you cut his throat or stab the heart?
You want to be the next Sabinkov?
Find out for yourself what killing is like
I think a stab in the heart will be better
The important thing is to avoid the ribs
Insert vertically under the left nipple
I heard you were from a royal family
I saw you reading a very interesting book
About anarchism
So you learned the language of the one you love?
I was born in Chosun.
My mother was a Chosun woman
Will you give me the honor of a toast with the royal family?
Seregay!
Seregay!
Seregay only sent me back
We divided the money to reduce the risk
And I came back eating only eggs for 7 days
Our leader was furious and ordered us to bring him back
The other members were sent
We were completely excluded from the operation
Seregay was handed over to us
Did you forget how he protected us when he was tortured?
In the end, you got in the way of his honorable death
How can they tell us to kill a comrade?
There are hundreds of members besides us
Why do you ignore that?
Please take the life that you saved
Seregay was a great fighter
Maybe Seregay was never meant to be one of us
I heard the gunshot from the opposite side
Those who are here today have no right to mourn
During last Kwang Dong earthquake,
Japanese had mercilessly massacred thousand of our people
With the remaining ashes of a Chosun fighter in front of us,
I dare declare...
He was in a such a bad state that we had to cremate him
We found out that Minami, Gato and Kuboda did it
For whatever it takes, we intend to seek retribution
All members and officials of the Provisional government, please remain to take a photo in memory of today
Everybody, look over here One, two, three
Hey Kuboda!
Idiot!
Did you have to take advantage of Kaneko as well?
What?
You made no scruples to attain your goals
How can we bring them together to fight our enemy?
You said that a rebel is cold
That terrorists are cold flames
You...
What are you guys doing?
By the despicable Gato and Kuboda, a Chosun national
They just used you for their terrorist activities
Do you know how Seregay died?
They killed Seregay
This is Seregay
Hey!
Look what we have here!
Which hometown you from?
Lee Geun consoled Kaneko in place of Seregay
The group silently accepted that she informed him about the Japs
What are you doing?
I drank coffee from it lots of times
Is this your place?
Are you my husband?
Why do Chosun men do that when they get acquainted?
Use it on your Chosun girls
Sorry.
You call us Japs, right?
I never thought of you as a Japanese woman before
Why is only Seregay dead and not you as well?
You hypocrite!
Christ, those two kissing away like they were long lost lovers
Oh!
Want a cigarette?
Huh, are you leaving?
Wait!
Stay still!
What happened?
Shit!
Listen to him, Kuboda Drop the gun
Drop the gun!
Please!
Go away and listen to me
Listen to them, Kuboda
Shut up!
You son of a bitch!
Take it off.
Off!
You shit!
What are you doing?
To eat a boiled egg, you have to crack its shell
No!
What do you mean by no?
This is inhuman
Inhuman?
What are you supposed to do in a situation like this?
Just kill him Kill?
Is this all you learned while being tortured by the Japs?
What are you talking about?
My great responsibility for...
Bring the electric generator, okay?
I said get a move on it!
Where are you going?
Is Gato dead?
Why betray like that?
Betray?
He was shot several times in the back, you say?
There was no time for you to recover the body
Then what was it that we buried?
The real Seregay is right here
So, it was all for this
Yes.
After killing the only man I loved, did you have to go so far as to use me to kill Minami?
Tell me why the hell did we have that fake funeral?
Was it to keep the truth from me?
You guys are geniuses
What makes you different from the Japs?
What gives you the right to ask about betrayal?
What is betrayal, anyway?
Leave Shanghai
We hid out because there was a search warrant out for us
Insufficient subsidy, crude weapons and an informant...
Many of our activities failed and we were falling apart
We needed a new change...
So is that why your first love ran away?
My first love, Chun-Mae
She had the biggest breasts.
So I...
Ouch, it hurts Hey kid, sit!
Come sit here, I said Sang-Gu!
From now on, we fight for a collective rise of socialism
Socialism is just another dictatorship
What do you want, then?
I want to work and take as much as I can
Just as I expected.
I devoted my whole life to it
You need ten years to match the number of people
They replace a Jap as soon as one goes down
Even if we kill the Emperor, his son will take his place
But terrorism is...
All right.
Do as you like
Please finish your meal
I came down here not to serve nobles and Japs
Do you know what my dream was?
It was to die like a hero with style in Chosun or Japan
Forget orders!
Just wipe them out.
You just wait and see
Then all of you...
So what are you going to do?
I knew for a while that the age of socialism will come
But as sick as I am, what could I do in Kwang-ju?
And how could I lead others?
What does it mean?
A group of sailors without a captain
You bums!
What are you doing there?
Come over here
Pay the rent The rent, I said
Is that edible?
Want some?
Damn it!
You can have all you want!
I heard that 1 00 cooked carps will cure lung disease
Sang-Gu, come with me
You think our kids live on water?
No matter what, I want my money
Give me the money now!
You understand?
This knife is from Arabia
This knife is the real thing
This is all I can give you What?
Hey, do you know what kind of knife this is?
Kid, what you doing?
Take the money
Place your bets
If you make him fall, we give 1 0 times the bet
If you hold out for a minute they give you double the bet
If you fall, then you lose
What if I win?
You get 1 0 times the bet
Give me half of that money
I never saw him fall once.
Just give me the money
God damn
Come over here!
Wait a minute!
Start!
We won, eh?
Hey, give it here.
Sang-Gu, eat some more, okay?
Hey kid, is your stomach getting greased up enough?
This restaurant is the best and the most famous in Shanghai
Eat all you want, huh?
The guys must be hungry, too...
I got it all figured out
This was delicious
If we get this for the guys, then...
Ling Ling
He was arrested for being involved with the Chosun people
We had to close the business
It was a cold and poor winter
Just do as I tell you...
Shut up!
Why do you always do that to me?
Is what I say that worthless?
Are you out of your mind?
Then you really want us to be petty thieves?
What do you think, Han?
Sang-Gu, you should listen too.
Come sit here
This Shanghai mob is looking for a new face
We just hand over the drugs and get the money
Anyway, everything will be over in a month, right?
I think that...
Be quiet!
Who asked you to think?
Leave the thinking to us
You stop there!
what a sickle is
So I took his sickle and slit his throat
Bastards!
I thought they were my comrades
Sang-Gu, after this, you go off on your own
I plan to do something on my own from now on
Put your hands up!
Hands up!
You!
You put this in, you bastards
Stay right there!
Turn around!
Ah, shut up
You could at least say thanks
What are you doing there?
Come on
What?
For the old timers at the Provisional Government to see
Let them have all the credit What good are they, anyway?
In 1 91 0, the traitors sold the government to Japan,
Now, the minister of the Provisional Government are selling the pseudo-government
Hey!
Kim Ku beat and killed Japanese officials, just like us
Dol-suk!
That was Mr. Kim Ku
Oh, shit!
In a week, from Daedal Pier at Hwangpo River, a cruiser with Japanese officials will depart from here, then pass through Inchon and arrive at Tokyo
Again, careful how you act
Especially you, Dol-Suk
Why do you always pick on me?
But, will all the head Japs really be meeting there?
The cruiser seems difficult
We do a preliminary infiltration
Even if we fail, dead or alive we will still make it to our homeland
I hope all of you will take the risk
I really miss my homeland
But security must be tight
Our worst scenario is sinking the cruiser
And Sang-Gu!
You just follow me
Dol-Suk!
Why do you say things like that?
It drives me crazy!
And...
They were the best that we could find in weapons
They were crude, but we were confident with that
You know what to do, right?
Dol-Suk and I will attack first with pistols
If we succeed, then we can all safely go to Inchon
If we fail, the second team attacks
What do you think of my opinion?
I have a good feeling about this one
Today will be our last day in Shanghai
Be especially careful of how you act and dress
So is this the last time?
Then what are we doing here?
Anything fun to do?
Yes, there is
Hurry up
Here we go!
Ready?
One, two...
Smile!
Hey, did she take it already?
Did you take it?
Yes...
Yes...
Good
Write a phrase to put on the photo
Life is heavy as mountains, but death is light as feather
We meet tomorrow morning at the rendezvous
We split?
Take care.
Later, you tell me what you did with Ling Ling, okay?
You look like a monkey
Ling Ling, I have to go tomorrow at seven
Consider yourself lucky!
You go back to your hometown
I said, go back!
Have a good life
What do these things mean to us right this moment?
Excuse me
Kang Dol-Suk
You think killing a couple of Japanese people will bring independence to Chosun and make you heroes?
Your ideals are over
Even after their death, they could not return home.
They failed, but they were still heroes...
A revolutionist is like a gust of wind that blows towards this filthy world from a far away beautiful land
When I got out of prison, it was after the independence
The pro-Japanese Noh Duk-Sool became a police investigator
He arrested and tortured Leader Kim Won-Bong
He was accused of being a communist
After three days of loathing, he went over to North Korea.
Today, I am to receive a medal from the President of South Korea,
Rhee Seung-man
Does President Rhee deserve to give anyone the medal?
Today, at the ceremony President Rhee and I will be meeting our fallen brothers
Sang-Gu, do you want to try?
The Russian Revolution was achieved not by individuals but by the masses
Sang-Gu, black looks good on you
What matters is that we are together now
There was an ideal land for us
So free and pure that it could not exist in this world...
From the time of Diocletian.
Roman drama.
The centurion Sebastian meets the christian Fulia.
Sylvia, the beloved of the emperor, surprises the two lovers.
The diversions of the emperor.
Sylvia, who persecutes Sebastian with her zeal, charges him with the emperor as a christian.
On the track of the guilty.
If One Could See Into the Future
The angel of life points the path followed by Death
Do you want to go through?
Give me your hair.
In the Kingdom of Death The clocks of life
The fountain of Fate
There it is.
Childhood
In his twenties
Damn you life!
Stop his life...
Death is better than dishonor.
Who would have thought that my daily view here would be of a cemetery?
TURKISH PASSION
We should have learned to please, to seduce to deceive to know what is in men to see them coming.
And, in that way, dominate them.
The females of the apes, our first cousins...
Those females are much more intelligent than their males.
A little.
Like this bit of candy.
And how am I like a female ape?
Are there no stupid apes?
I feel happily stupid, for the moment.
A bad start, Desi.
A clever ape only gives her male the right to mate with her.
That is, screw her.
In the broadest sense of the word.
Duty is a pleasure for me.
Thanks to the bishop.
Your man is delightful.
A real Prince Charming.
The best match in this city.
And the best looking.
And undoubtedly the most delicate.
I say polite things like this to my husband.
Things like that, understand?
With eleven indents on the rim and one at each end.
If your mother were here...
How handsome he is!
Marriage is like a blank check.
You can write fabulous amounts on it but it cannot be cashed without the signature of the account holder and that is God.
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday, dear Ramiro,
Happy birthday to you.
Make a wish.
Well done!
First things first.
Be happy, happy, on your birthday.
Ramirito, may God bless you.
May there be peace on your birthday.
And may you have many more.
Come on, children!
Children!
Juanito!
Toni!
My Toni loves me so much.
And for Juan too.
Kiss, kiss, kiss for Aunt Desi.
Here, take this, my darling.
Go on, and be careful.
An obstetrician in Madrid told me so.
They told my grandmother the same and she got a natality award.
You end up sick of kids.
Meanwhile, we can lend you ours so you can practice.
Just one week.
Two weeks.
I accept.
Why?
What about a toast?
To Turkey?
Is it true about the doctor?
Yes.
Do you hear?
Yes.
Girls!
Come on!
Spices?
What do you mean?
I was told that Turkey smells of spices, of soup with spices.
I do.
Maybe your gynecologist was wrong.
First shot of your expressions in Istanbul.
Arturo, I have your camera.
We are in Byzantium, in Constantinople, in Istanbul.
Welcome.
Constantine VI, Emperor of the East called Asia Minor Anatolia.
In the glorious era of the Ottoman Empire the West invented the image of a barbarous Turk.
This was adorned with a complaisant tendency towards sensuality.
Neither was true.
Western civilization was born here with Miletus, Anaximander, Heracliteus.
Gods, heroes and the Christian apostles.
The Iliad and the Odyssey.
We Turks are Europeans like you.
Skyscrapers are as much a part of Istanbul as St. Sophia and the Topkapi which you have come to see but the city still has that charm acquired over the centuries.
Istanbul lies between two worlds, two seas, two continents, Europe and Asia.
Two of the seven wonders of the world...
She fainted.
Are you all right?
Calmer?
Will he bite?
Will it hurt when he bites?
My name is Yaman.
And I will do anything so that you fall in love with this country.
Coffee, sherbets, the ottoman the divan and raisins are all Turkish inventions.
Our baths, ladies and gentlemen, are famous throughout the world.
When you were still in the Dark Middle Ages we lived in a world of pleasure and voluptuousness.
We are arriving at the hotel.
You can rest, or do whatever you wish because this guide is at your complete and entire disposal.
You see to the cases.
Marcelo!
May I?
Thank you.
Forgive me.
Welcome.
Desi...
Come on.
Laura!
You can rest until lunchtime.
We have two options.
A siesta and a visit to the mosques.
Or the cisterns and mosques and no siesta.
Which do you prefer?
A siesta.
What about you?
As you wish.
When the Turks took possession of Constantinople in 1453 one of the first actions by the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror was to bury in this spot the man who had been...
The mosque and its mausoleum were built in 1458.
The light, as you see is reflected in the marble and in the ivory of the ninety nine windows with lattices.
That number corresponds to the ninety nine names of Allah.
An earthquake which took place at the beginning of the 18th century caused serious damage and it was rebuilt in the year 1800.
The tomb of Eyup is one of the most interesting monuments in Ottoman Istanbul.
As well as its walls of 16th century ceramics you can observe the strange religious behavior of the Turkish Moslems.
Come on.
How many rolls of film did we bring?
Four.
Not only the Turks use this, but the Jews and Christians too.
I myself did it every fortnight and felt very well.
One of the things the Turks rightly label us as is dirty.
Anonymous.
A Spaniard imprisoned by the Turks.
In the toilets, perhaps.
Listen to this about the harem women.
Look.
Is anything wrong?
No, nothing.
A bit of a turn.
Will we get a doctor?
Desi is uneasy in this country.
There is the pirate captain seated in his chair.
Asia on one side.
Europe.
And there before him, Istanbul.
Sail on fearlessly, my craft.
No enemy vessel, nor storm, nor calm can alter your course or overcome your valor.
I must be mad.
Slip away in the bazaar tomorrow.
Wait a minute.
A photo over there in the alley.
Marcelo, there.
Stand a bit closer together.
You can come in.
Come and see what a carpet shop is like.
My brother will serve you.
I want to buy cuff links for Ramiro.
How did you learn so much so quickly?
Desideria...
What will become of me?
Tell me, what?
I love you.
Yaman...
I want you for ever.
Pass it on, man!
How can he do that with the ball?
Who was it?
I lied.
When you lie about that, Desi, you have to take precautions.
Come on.
We could have done it before.
I knew that you knew.
Except for Ramiro, we all knew.
But we thought it was over.
What will you tell Ramiro?
The truth.
I have never spoken three sentences to you without referring to this tumultuous feeling which has enslaved me since I first saw you.
I am waiting for Ramiro.
I have something to tell you.
I saw a doctor in Madrid too.
Or both of us.
Although it now seems you can.
What will you do?
That may be so.
Forgive me for saying that.
Divorce.
Divorce?
That would make me the laughing stock of our friends.
What has that Turk got?
Yes.
Do you swear?
I prefer my child to be reared in our home.
Then all will stay as it is.
It was a very quick birth.
Here you are, with Mom.
My love.
Will you love him?
Yes, it is.
Come to Mommy.
Come to Mommy.
Come to Mommy, Ivan.
Ramiro!
My love.
What happened?
Call Don Angel.
There, my love.
There, my love.
At last.
What happened?
We were sleeping and I felt that he was choking.
All right.
Prepare a cold bath, quickly.
What is it, doctor?
But why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why, God, why?
Why?
My baby.
My God!
What a tragedy for poor Desi.
She wants to be alone.
To meet again after so long in such circumstances.
My son...
Your mother is going mad.
Now she wants to think you are showing her the only way.
The last chance to put some order into her feelings.
My baby.
My baby.
You know why I am going and where.
Just one justification.
I renounce any settlement.
Desideria.
Where is Yaman?
Yaman.
Yaman Dunbar.
Orteisar.
Thank you.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
I like to feel you like that.
Inside me.
Not moving.
Yaman...
We had a child.
He died recently.
Will we have more?
I want you to forget everything.
I want you to be another woman.
But will we have more?
Of course.
If God wishes.
Your God or mine?
They both have to wish it.
The wedding is tomorrow.
Today the bride says good-bye to her friends.
Want to go?
Yes, of course.
We must buy a gift.
You must go on your own.
Come on.
Come in.
I know it smells of spices.
That offends the educated western sense of smell.
But what can I do?
This is what smells.
You were alone.
More.
Sign here.
Good-bye.
Thanks.
So long.
Good morning.
Hello.
I would like information on how to get a residence visa.
How long are you staying in Turkey?
Indefinitely.
And your husband?
Check with your Turkish friends but in theory you need a justifiable occupation here.
Want a lift?
Do you speak Turkish?
I should make an effort.
Thank you.
Hey!
What do I call you?
Friends call me Desi.
All right, Desi.
What could I need?
You live in Turkey with a Turk, and in this neighborhood.
I can accept this other life because I have a god.
A god to adore.
And every day, every night, he gives me a piece of heaven.
Have you gone crazy?
Why are you dressed like that?
I want my master to come into me.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you more than I can ever express.
Stop it!
I want to make love with you naturally and happily not as if it were a tragedy!
Not like this.
Come here.
Please.
I love you, I love you.
Me, mama of Yaman.
Son, daughter.
You?
Me?
Your mother?
Yes.
These are my children.
I thought she might be your wife.
Careful.
Now I find out you have a wife and two children.
You could have guessed.
What am I doing in Istanbul?
I am separated, legally separated.
When I began to love you I already had a family.
You kept it very quiet.
I have to have them a few weekends!
What do you want?
Are there any aspirins here?
A woman lived here before.
Are you jealous?
Your lover is back.
Three hairpins.
Whose are they?
I found them here.
I never said you were my first woman.
But I want to be the last!
Have they eaten?
Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Go and meet him.
I said to be nice to him.
How could you?
Why is it so hard for you to oblige him and oblige me?
I understood you perfectly, Desi, and you, me.
Why?
Hello.
Yes?
What happened?
Where are you now?
Calm down.
Calm down.
I feel like killing someone.
Go and get it, then come to the consulate.
So long.
Arturo stayed at the hotel.
That way, you and I can talk.
Oh, Laura!
Humiliated, offended.
Come on, Desi, come on.
Stop that nonsense.
He was just a good lay.
You must try to forget.
Yes.
I warn you, Desi.
Marriage is very serious.
I must tell you that.
What if I do?
Arturo and I could be intermediaries.
All may not be lost with Ramiro.
But you must be willing.
Look, I will never be me without Yaman!
What does that Turk have?
And other things you can imagine.
Other things I dream about every night.
And now please, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
I want to rest for a while.
Coming up.
Anything else?
Bored?
Will you join us?
And you?
Desideria.
Desirée?
Desideria.
But call me Desi.
Where are you going to?
Why were you there?
Really?
To a Turk?
Why?
Are you leaving?
Forgive me.
Why?
The Turk?
And now I know.
A whore tied for life to her pimp.
Where were you?
In Madrid.
What should I do with you?
You can kill me if you want.
I should throw you out, put you in the street.
Put cold water on your face.
Do you love me?
Take your time.
To begin with I think you should eliminate a few of them the ones that you like least.
Can I come in now?
Yes, come in.
Definitely not that tie.
So what?
So what?
A kiss...
A kiss...
A kiss in Spain is a sign of love.
It can never lie.
Thank you.
She wants to be the captain of the Aragonese troops.
Translate.
The Virgin of the Pillar wants to be, not French but captain of the Aragonese troops.
In France, we have enough virgins like that.
In France, we have a lot of virgins.
If all Frenchmen are like you, that would surprise her.
A kiss...
A kiss...
Fuck, stop kicking my foot.
Am I not doing it right?
He gets up early to open his lovely shop in the bazaar.
The queen of the evening!
I beg you to stay and enjoy the evening with the very same ease as I leave you with.
I will tell Alain, my secretary to visit you tomorrow at the bazaar.
Could you take Blanche and Alain to their hotel?
With pleasure.
The Turks are very pleasant.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Come soon.
I love you.
I love you too.
A gift.
Come.
Take it off.
Of course I do.
Are you going to hit me?
What is it with you?
You never understand.
Come.
I want you to know who fucks you best.
You must do me another favor.
A very big favor.
Yes.
Yes.
All right?
Give him this envelope.
Will I speak bad French, or bad Spanish?
I can understand French.
There is money missing.
Lots of dollars.
Is that his name?
No, Yaman.
...knows the risks.
Will you have to make up what is missing?
Is he your friend?
Your lover?
Do you know him well?
Let me explain.
He does business with us.
Your good lover is very clever.
Very clever.
Too clever.
Want a snort?
No, thank you.
Well.
As I was saying...
He exports his best carpets soaked with that white powder which you have just refused.
And how did he get so clever?
Do you understand?
Are you comfortable?
I am humble.
Get dressed.
I like you very much.
Mademoiselle has found a hidden treasure.
If you like it, take it.
Wait.
It belonged to a beautiful lady.
Please.
A pistol without bullets is of no use.
They are very small bullets.
If you ever want to use it on your Yaman fire at close range right at his head.
Open up.
Look, my friends.
Reinforcements.
Shit!
Why give to others what only I deserve?
Kiss me.
Hurry up, Alain.
Got a cigarette?
Yaman.
Love is like trade.
A good lover must fulfill two obligations.
First, never lose, keep what you have.
Second, never stake everything on one card.
You must keep some reserves, just in case.
And believe me, the other person becomes sick of his slave.
How long have you known that whore?
I want you to drink let yourself go, live and let live.
Love is a game which brightens our lives.
To really do that, its caresses must last.
It must pervade everything, just as a perfume does.
Beneath that silk, you both have breasts which are swelling hearts which are racing, breathing which is agitated contractions which you are beginning to feel somewhere.
Love is always there to be discovered especially with more than two.
Behind the knees a groin, the smoothness of an inner thigh the smoothness of the phallus a curl of hair, armpits, cheekbones, lips.
You see?
Why not ask her what she does to understand life?
Why are you so serious?
How long have you been sleeping with this bitch?
Go away, and let this be the last time I see you.
We must leave discreetly.
She has to get away.
She has to get away.
Desi has to get away.
Get a doctor!
Good-bye, my desires.
Good-bye, children I can never have.
Good-bye, lovers who denied me friendship.
Everything is over.
It all comes down to the same.

end of the first part
THE FALL OF TROY second part
Since the Greeks could not overcome the city by force, it is decided to resort to cunning.
A number of soldiers was hidden in a wooden horse of great proportions and by quick departure of the troops it was made as if the siege has been broken.
The trick has worked.
The Trojans think that the Greeks have fled in a hurry and even left behind the statue dedicated to one of their gods.
The Trojans decide to bring the horse, this idol of the Greeks, ...inside the walls of Troy for the appeasement of their own gods.
The colossal size of the horse makes it necessary that a part of the fortress wall must be torn down, a gap which the Trojans in their flush of victory fail to repair.
Ulysses the brave and cunning Greek, to whose brain occurred the trick, reports that the plan has worked.
The wall has been torn down;
the horse in which the soldiers are hidden, is in the city.
Now continue the attack on Troy.
The Greek soldiers, the living contents of the wooden horse, ...begin their destructive work by setting fire to Troy in several places.
Through the gap that the Trojans had made to bring in the horse, ...now enter the Greek soldiers, and surprise the Trojans, already frightened by the fire.

I want...
Want a divorce from my wife.
My wife loves another and I...
I do not want to be an obstacle to their happiness.
A marriage blessed by the Church is sacred and indissoluble!
The law allows divorce in only three cases...
If one spouse does not show any sign of life for 5 years.
If there is a disability in the marriage...
In the case of duly proved adultery!
But keep in mind...
Three beings coexist: my wife and I and a third person...
Among us there is such great tension, the conflict of feelings so painful,
That divorce is the only possible solution!
What should I do?
Each one carries the cross imposed by the Lord!
In a similar case,
What remains to a mere mortal?
The law...
Excuse me...
Do you still want to get a divorce?
Adultery with a police report.
Who are these people?
Do you want to be with or without police?
With a policeman, it will be five rubles, but it is safer.
Dear Lisa!
Victor Karenin and you are in love.
I do not want to change your life.
You will not see me again.
I free you, and I want to be free, too.
Farewell, be happy.

I got a brief recess from a session...
So I came for a moment.
I came directly from a session...
Then stay for dinner!
Dad, please...
Stop it, Dad.
Do you want to finish?
What do you want?
I can provide a revolver for a price.
I have no intention of committing suicide.
Why then the farewell letter?
Once again, you have made Lisa cry!
This house has become a living hell!
We avoid each other, we are at our limits.
Where are you going?
They love each other.
You must understand me ...
I cannot lie or hide ...
And above all, I do not want to be an obstacle to the happiness of others.
With the gypsies, life is taken more lightly.
I love you.
I do not wish, nor will wish, to change your life.
I shall not return again.
I free you and myself, too.
From Fedor Vassiliévitch.
But I hate you!
So, you have come here!
Get your coat.

I have to say ... she is waiting for you outside.
I pray you to forget everything and return home.
I will not go back on my decision.
He came to convince me to return to my wife.
She is crying.
You should go see her, and return.
I think otherwise.
Some days later.
What do you want from me?
To make a divorce possible!
We live in a state that has its laws ...
Put yourself in the place of Lisa ...
I am incapable of lying.
I cannot act in this odious comedy.
For Lisa ...
Okay, I will do everything that you ask of me.
The hotel room.
The witnesses.
The police.
Do we really have to go through everything .. down to every detail?
Sure!
We cannot give false testimony.
This client is very nervous.
An idealist.
I think it is time.
Did you not even taste a little?
Police Report:
The signatories testify under oath that they
in the company of a lady, being guilty of adultery,
as one of the requirements of paragraph 286 ...
You understand me.
This I cannot do.
Totally impossible!
I cannot even want to lie.
I will not lie!
Go to hell!
If only there were grounds for divorce ...
He will do everything necessary; he has given me his word.
I hate lying and I refuse to act in an odious comedy.
I find it easier to die.
You should get married to be happy.
I am stopping you from getting married, therefore I must die.
When you receive this letter I shall no longer be living.
I would say that you do not need this, right?
Go to hell, damned demon!
Police Report:
A week ago some clothes were found on the banks of the Moscow River as well as documents belonging to Mr. Fedor Vassilievitch Protassov.
A portfolio contained a letter explaining his reasons for suicide.
Three days later, a body was found.
Are you coming to identify the body?
Show this lady the body of Mr. Protassov.
You could open the window, stupid!
We can certify that she recognizes the corpse.
Come quickly ...
My parents will wake up and lock me in!
I cannot go with you.
A man without documents, an outlaw.
I am a living corpse.
You cannot join me in the life that awaits me.
You must believe me and let me go alone.
How dear he has become since he died.
Everything was so uncertain, and now ... everything is clear.

Someone could get some money ...

The law.

Who would want such a man?
He is a ridiculous figure!
I am not guilty.
I wanted everything to be better ...
LAW.
When asked ... carry out the identification of the corpse ...
Why did you say you recognized your husband?
I was so convinced ... and so nervous also ...
Your name?
Your name, profession, confession?
How can you ask such dumb things?
You already know!
Three people ... waging a painful moral battle outsiders can never understand!
Only a divorce could clear that tension ...
Freedom!
But you place many obstacles in the way of that freedom!
So I found a way out ... without dying.
An exit that would have been distressing and painful.
I ruined my life.
MY LIFE!
All alive are relieved and happy.
To survive a vile individual, a hustler ...
Do you admit your guilt?
I wonder if he acknowledges his guilt!
The prosecutor.
First, the will of an individual.
Furthermore, the law.
Naturally, the law comes first!
The law is intangible.
The interest of the State requires punishment for a crime.
The defense.
What about the accused?
Is there some trial here with a crime and a criminal?
No, we have before us some unhappy beings.
Who could leave this room illuminated by the sagacity of this judgment.
They have recognized their faults ... and begin a new and happy life.
We must help.
The court retires to deliberate.
What might be the harshest sentence?
Banishment to Siberia, for your wife and for you.
What about the best?
A penance and, of course, the restoration of the marriage.
The jury room.
KARADJORDJE or Biography of immortal leader Karadjordje
Cica Ilija Stanojevic and Cira Manok Savkovic
Executive producer:
Svetozar Botoric Director:
Cica Ilija Stanojevic
Karadjordje, the first Serbian feature film was filmed in summer 1911. and presented on October 23rd.
For the last time, movie was presented in 1928. in USA and since than it was considered as lost.
Film was founded in Austrian film archive in Wien in July of 2003.
This copy was made in Cine laboratory in Rome.
Original movie was made without intertitles, but they were made by Aleksandar Erdeljanovic.
After Serbia was defeated in Kosovo battle in 1389, since 1459. it was occupied by Turkish empire.
For almost four centuries Serbian people was humiliated and without any rights...
But Serbs believed that they are going to be free and united again some day.
14th November 1762.
In the house of Petar Zivkovic child was expected.
Turkish landowner came with plea to spend the night.
Petar, the terrible lion came in my dream and ate me, but Childs voice awoke me.
I want to see that child.
Your son will be great man.
Take good care of him and always remember what I told you.
Years were passing by.
Little Djordje liked to play Serbs and Turks, but he enjoyed most... listening epic songs about Kosovo battle and death of sultan Murat who was killed... by Milos Obilic, great hero.
Once, vicious Turk came to Djordje, little Shepard.
Righteous anger.
More years passed by.
Girls were coming to the spring to talk, but Jelena was waiting for someone.
Envious and angry father.
Djordje got married.
But soon, Turks came to his hose in Topola.
Their leader was janissary Adem.
And you bride, come to serve, as you will be tonight.
For some time, Djordje was outlaw with Stanoje Glavas and he killed more Turks.
Turks called him Black Djordje because of his dark ten.
In fear of Turkish revenge, he went Over Sava river to Srem, but...
Base of Austrian army in Sombor 1787.
Fighting bravely, Karadjordje became sergeant in Austrian army, but he was homesick.
There was no comfort.
Hidden by the shelter of the night, again in Serbia.
After murder of Just Mustafa in 1801.
Serbia was under seven Turkish outlaws.
Robberies, raping, taking children into slavery became very often.
By the ending of 1803.
Serbs decided to organize uprising.
They were looking for signs from the sky.
In casserole they saw their bodies without heads.
In holly books they founded confirmation of their near ending, because of their actions.
Worst among them, Focic Mehmed-aga suggests killing leaders:
Palalija, Bircanin, Carapic and Karadjordje.
After death of more than 80 significant people, Serbs realized that it is time for uprising.
February 14. 1804.
Orasac
Serbian dukes came but no one wanted to take leadership, even greatest heroes.
And than voice said:
Here is the chosen one!
Long live Karadjordje Petrovic, commander and leader of Serbs!
Brothers, we know each other.
Will you be with me?
We will!
So help us God!
To the fight!
For cross of honor and freedom of gold!
After first victories, Karadjordje met Prota Mateja and Petar Novakovic.
Prota, did you send my order to the courts.
To be just and equal for all?
I did, but dukes and people want parliament.
Let it be as people want!
The parliament will take place in Smederevo.
Than Ibrahim and Izedin arrived and they brought peace offer.
There will be peace when we get all fortresses and see landlord under our feet.
There are charges against your brother.
Djordje, my son, what you did to me?
On Jun 28. 1806. there was great battle between Serbs and Bosnian Turks.
Karadjordje and his staff expecting Turkish cavalry led by Kulin Capitan on Misar field.
Attack, profits sons, heroes from wonderful Bosnia!
After he listened war plans of his officers, Karadjordje ordered attack!
In blood battle many Turks lost their lives.
Among them, Kulin Capitan.
Serbs are celebrating great victory and final liberation.
Karadjorjes rising among the immortal ones.
1811.
After great victories, leaders started to fight among themselves.
They wanted to restrict Karadjordjes power.
Most of dukes stood by leader.
Nenadovic changed his mind and entered the new Government.
Others were banished.
International political relations changed.
Napoleon attacked Russia, main allay.
Russia got draw with Turks.
Sultan asked Serbs to surrender.
War plans divided dukes.
Karadjordje wanted to go to the woods and from there to attack Turks.
Others wanted to defend cities to the last man.
Over voted, Karadjordje said:
In July 1813.
Turks took whole country.
Karadjordje went to Austria and than to Russia.
On March 30. 1815.
Milos Obranovic, duke of Rudnik area become leader of Second uprising, in Takovo.
In two years, by negotiations and in battle field, he managed to get autonomy and become grand duke.
After agreement with Milos Obrenovic and Vujica Vulicevic, Karadjordje comes back to Serbia on Jun 11. 1817.
He wanted another uprising.
Because of that Vujica came to Milos.
!
Move, someone important is coming.
Karadjordje is back.
Let me be short:
Let them believe it is blood revenge.
Kill him.
Him?
Never!
Your life, lives of your family and 2000 golden pieces, or you are going to strangled right away.
He is my godfather.
God, have mercy...
Godfathers blood...
But even fathers head will go if it is going to save mine.
July 24. 1817.
Radovanje woods.
I have your family.
Evening.
For people, for Serbia, for freedom!

Master or crazy he is our last chance, we must risk it!
Let me go too!
No!
Why not I need to catch Yung Man Kin myself!
You think I will go crazy and kill him?
I can tell from your silence!
It is for your own good!
We will talk about it when we get back!
Hey, Man!
Have you called the master sleuth here?
He told us to come first, he will call us when he arrives!
Hey, why did Yung Man Kin tell us to come here?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing!
Wa... wa... wa...
What are you doing!
What is this place
Wa... wa... wa...
Ah!
Wa... wa... wa...
Where have you been?
I have stayed here.
You are lying!
We saw you in Sriracha!
Yes!
And we saw you killing Yung Man Kin!
Good!
That bastard, I wish he can die ten more times!
You are actually behind the whole thing!
You made that phone call and lured us to Sriracha!
What does it matter?
Now he is dead!
Are you happy now?
Have you killed anyone?
Tell us!
I have already told you!
He told me to stay!
How can I kill someone?
You think I will still believe you?
So you have never trusted me!
Yes
Alright, let me tell you if I could I would kill them all!
You are packing your things?
There are still lots of places to see here in Malaysia!
Have I frightened you?
Ask yourself!
Do you know why?
It is very hard to trust a human let alone a ghost!
I tell you what is in front of you might not be real!
I told you I have nothing to do with him!
So you have never trusted me!
Yes!
When you see this photo you might
I start receiving awards when I was seventeen!
A foreign guy gave this to me!
Yip Chi Yuen Private Investigations
Pig!
Bao Gung!
Haha...
Bao Gung!
Bao Gung!
Bao Gung!
What a surprise.
Hey, what?
What happened?
What?
Yip Chi Yuen is Pig!
What?
The master sleuth?
I think Goat and Turkey are both killed by Pig!
What?
Then we have accused Siu Dip wrongly!
I saw him killed Bao Gung just now!
What!
A very strong sense of killing is coming towards this place!
The sense of death is strong here!
I have heard that there is a ghost in this house who is harming people.
She has already killed two people!
Every since the owner of this house died in a horrible accident this place has became a gathering place for ghosts!
Let me cleanse this place today for the common good!
Alright!
Then I will deal with them !
No!
He has a gun!
You want to escape?
Damn this monk is very powerful I am no match for him !
If I leave and he comes out where can he find me?
Abomination!
You have hurt humans too many times!
I am not forgiving you today!
Damn you stupid monk!
Damn you stupid monk!
I will let you know how good I am when I was young!
I will accept your challenge!
Ah damn
Ah .
Ai
Why do you have to head to certain death!
Ah ... wait!
Wait!
I am a disabled person!
I am a disabled person!
I am a mute!
I am a mute...
Yes yes we are half dead!
Hey actually this has nothing to do with us!
Haha yes
We should leave since it has nothing to do with us!
Wait what
What!
A gun!
We are all fucked!
Wu... wu...
30 years!
After 30 years everything should have ended!
I should have the chance to be a better person!
I have killed both Goat and Turkey!
Then nobody will know my secret!
No!
Man is in danger!
Save him!
I can hold on here!
What can you do if I leave?
Just go!
Come out to die!
Otherwise your death will be much more painful!
Hey, I have watched the movies his gun has 1 6 bullets!
So you want us to rush out out to risk his 2 bullets?
What if you counted wrong?
then we would be shot for nothing!
I am not wrong!
Hey we are here!
Where do you think you are going?
Ah
Hey!
This bullet is for you!
Yip Chi Yuen!
Hey
Yip Chi Yuen!
Ya
Hey ya
Ya
Hey ya Hey ya
Ya
Hey ya
Ya
Siu Dip!
I know you will come to find me!
You think I will come unprepared?
Ha
Hey
Ha
Ya
Ha
Let me take you with her!
If you can let him go I will leave the world immediately and forget about everything!
Alright!
Siu Dip, Siu Dip!
Siu Dip
Siu Dip Ai!
Siu Dip!
Why did this happen?
She finally agrees to leave the world.
Siu Dip refused to leave because she wants revenge!
Now she can give it all up because of Man do you still think she is a bad ghost?
On the other hand no matter how powerful you are you still cannot see through a human heart!
Are you afraid?
If you want to give it all up, follow me!
You are wrapped in red rope so you can never return to this world!
You two will be meeting Siu Dip soon!
Bastard
You are so naive!
Hey!
I was afraid that the ghost will refuse to leave and tell everyone about what happened to her!
Now that she is gone after you are dead no one will know my secret!
Put down the weapon to redeem yourself!
Hey ya
Whatnow?
Ah .
.Yip
Chi Yuen you heartless bastard!
I will come find you even after I became a ghost!
When I killed Goat and Turkey l wrap them with red rope just like you now!
Hey!
Help!
What can we do now?
Help me... helpme
Buddha please come out and help us!
come out and help us
Ai ai ai man man!
hey... hey
Man ... what ?
Haha is this really happening?
The Buddha really came to save us!
The Malayan police have release photos of the fugitive Yip Chi Yuen.
It is believed that he is involved lin the murder of two people in Sriracha of one Malayan Chinese and Police detective Weng Yung Man Kin .
Siu Dip has finally left the world and Ah Ngau will handle the rest of the things.
My trip has finally ended.
I have not believed Hiu Wa and Siu Dip in the end they both died for me!
And because of this I realized that for both human and ghosts trust is a very important thing!
I can finally be myself!
Ah!
Ah lt has killed someone!
A vase has dropped down!
So!
Are you dead yet?
How can I die and leave you behind?
Ouch!
It still hurts!
Just a bit relax
Actually it is not bad now I am in charge of the human world and you are in charge of the ghost world human and ghosts can now live in peace!

No actors appear in this film, just men, women and children who love the Seine.
And then with sparkling eyes, he adds...
The Seine is like a person sometimes she runs and rushes past hurrying her step when evening falls.
Sometimes in spring she pulls up short and gazes at you like a mirror.
And if you cry she cries or smiles to cheer you up and always breaks into laughter when the summer sun appears.
Up and downstream always the same turning handle fortunes in wine, coal and wheat which rise and fall with the river according to the tide of the market.
Fortunes in bottles and broken glass, treasure troves of rusted scrap of old bedsteads abandoned, reclaimed.
The Seine is a factory.
A woman from the ÎIe des Cygnes, telling herself the same in her dreams.
Risky, dangerous, tumultuous and dreamy all at once.
A river with bridges, docks and quays a river with eddies from sewers and sometimes a drowned man, if it is not a dead dog.
With anglers who never catch a thing.
And the Seine hears laughter and slips away like a cat.
A river like any other any other any other.
A waterway like any other waterway.
Water from glaciers and torrents and underground lakes and melted snow and vanished clouds.
A river like the Durance or the Guadalquivir or the Amazon or Moselle, the Rhine, the Thames or the Nile.
A river like the River Love like the River Love, sings the broadening Seine and at night the Milky Way accompanies its tender golden murmur and also the railway with its usual muffled din.
The Louvre, Tuileries, Eiffel and Pointue Towers and Notre Dame, Obelisk, Gare de Lyon, Austerlitz they are my châteaux of the Loire.
There once was the Seine once there once was love there once was misfortune and another time forgetfulness.
There once was the Seine and once there was life.
The End
Verbatim Yucatan, 23.976 fps.
For every action...
There is an equal, and opposite, reaction.
North Pole
EL MONSTRUO ALADO
Radar, designed to defend us against attack.
Radar stations on Mountain tops...
In deserts, deep in untracked forests.
In a thousand, secret and isolated places.
Over both oceans there are radar equipped picket planes.
In both oceans, manmade radar islands to guard our flanks.
There are the inshore pickets, and several hundred miles beyond them are the off shore pickets.
Another radar fence stretches across the long unfortified border between the United States and Canada.
A pine tree radar fence.
And beyond that...
Still another network of electronic eyes.
The Mid Canada Radar Fence.
Even farther north, in the very shadow of the North pole this fence... the Distant Early Warning System known as the DEW line.
Ready to transmit the first warning signal of a sneak attack across the polar region.
To build the DEW line an armada of ships was assembled in the largest, and most secretly planned operation since the Normandy Invasion.
Grinding through treacherous polar ice fields in a desperate gamble against time and weather
To land a mountain of supplies, machines, tractors, and men upon the ice.
First things first, level landing strips for heavy cargo planes,
then shelters for the men, for the planes, and for operations.
... and while some hands are busying laying long pipelines to transport fuel, others build tanks to store it.
The work continues, day and night, around the clock, 7 days a week.
At long last, the ships are gone, the summer is gone, but the job is finished.
Red Eagle One, centennial of the Arctic, nerve center of the DEW line, is operational.
Colonel Parkman arriving, dispatch jeep.
Colonel Parkman?
Glad to have you with us.
Across the roof of the continent still farther north, an outpost of the DEW line.
Hey Mike, Hey Mike, get a look at this.
Hey wait a minute...
Listen!
This is Kane, picket 7327 calling Red Eagle One come in Red Eagle One.
This is Kane, picket 7327 calling Red Eagle One...
Come in Red Eagle One.
Hello 7327 this is Red Eagle One, I read you, over.
Put the old man on the horn would you Pete?
... right, roger.
Colonel Parkman, Walter?
The building has been damaged.
I tried to contact them, but there was no answer, over.
Over and out.
When did Weather 4 report in last?
At uh, zero eight hundred, sir, right on the button.
See if you can contact them again.
alright.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
No answer, sir.
Keep trying.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
These did.
Everything was under control when they checked in at zero eight hundred.
Nothing unusual has been reported since then.
No storms...
The sides are caved out as though something crashed into the roof.
Well, if it was a plane that hit it...
Maybe the men are on the way back to base right now.
On foot?
They would leave footprints in the snow.
Do you see any?
Take a look here!
What do you got?
A plane?
No plane never made that short a run.
A helicopter?
If there is an ordinary explanation of what happened, then...
So, the only recent contact you had with the weather shack was when the helicopter dropped supplies there five days ago?
Yes sir.
You checked Weather 1?
Yes sir.
Weather 4 made contact with them at zero eight one three.
Everything was Jake!
I never saw a blip like that before.
Hey, there it is again.
What do you make of it.
Sound the red alert!
Vector 360 climb to Angels 3, bogey 90 miles.
Red leader to Control.
Nothing here.
Give us a new Vector.
Bogey has disappeared, Return to home plate.
Jerry!
Sugar Fly to Red Eagle One...
Come in Red Eagle One.
Sugar Fly to Red Eagle One.
Come in Red Eagle One.
Hello Sugar Fly, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead.
They found it Colonel!
Get his position.
Yes sir.
Alert Lieutenant Pizar.
Yes sir.
Colonel!
Looks just like the weather shack.
Yeah.
Where are they?
Where are the bodies?
Easy.
Look out!
What in the world is...
What is it?
Looks like it had been broken off of something.
I give up.
You got me.
Well where do we go from here?
This is CONAD.
The Continental Air Defense Command, at Colorado Springs.
The focal point of the super sonic shield that guards the North American Continent.
A shield that could mean the difference between life and death for millions of Americans.
These are Hot phones!
Using them it takes only 15 seconds, to talk to Alaska, 10 seconds to alert Newfoundland,
5 seconds to contact you!
3 seconds to reach the Pentagon Command Post.
General Ford Speaking...
Yes.
I see.
The Arctic command has delivered the package.
Good afternoon gentlemen.
Oh No, no, Please, sit down.
Gentlemen...
Professor Gunther I believe you are in charge.
All of us are agreed to accept one thing this appendage comes from some living creature.
... but as to what creature, it was once a part of, we we are completely in the dark.
Our mathamist, Dr. Arnold Burton, has been unable to identify this object.
That is correct, sir.
alright.
Right?
That sounds logical...
Now what was it that came aboard?
You know the animal life of the Arctic.
We have asked ourselves that, General.
How?
We recommend that you ask Dr. Nedrick Jackson of the museum of Natural History here in Washington, to look into this.
He deals with life of past geological periods... as shown by the fossil remains of, plants and animals.
He has been able to re-construct prehistoric creatures with, no more to start with then a hand full of bones.
Curator.
Hi Marge.
Hi.
What have you got there?
A kid in my junior science group made it.
Here, want to count them?
Life parades through the ages.
Showing the progression of prehistoric creatures from the jelly fish, to the dinosaur, to primitive man.
Sounds alright.
Oh, excuse me.
Jackson talking.
The Pentagon?
What do you know maybe they want to call me back in the service.
This is Dr. Jackson.
General Ford?
Yes.
Yes.
I see General.
Everything alright?
... course.
Okay be mysterious.
Hope to die!
They found an old bone up at the North Pole.
The Pentagon wants to know, to whom it belongs.
More like gristle or cartilage.
A structure as large as this would have to serve a very specialized purpose in order to be cartelized.
Have you any idea what it comes from?
No, not the faintest.
If it were bone we could start from that.
Because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton.
As a matter of fact the reptile structure is bony and gentlemen, even birds have bony skeletons.
Lots of things: worms, snails, insects, shell fish.
Some invertebrates where there skeletons on the outside, well it an outer shell called an exoskeleton which is hard and rigid enough to protect the internal organs.
Insects have thin flexible places within their heads and bodies which allows them freedom of movement.
Then they have folds where the muscles are attached.
An Insect?
Well find that out partly from what we know, but mostly from what deduce.
Sort of.
Professor Gunther, the fluid from the end of the hook...
You had it analyzed?
Well we, did what we could in the time we had.
Precisely.
With very few exceptions the blood of insects contains no red corpuscles.
Now that we suspect this hook may have come from an insect...
Would you test the fluid for me and let me know what you get?
Be glad to.
Thanks.
Professor Gunther will make his test and...
Maybe...
I know it is!
Maybe not!
Look.
The Pentagon has never consulted you before.
The papers say they have a mystery on their hands.
One and one still make two, so it follows that they must need information in your field.
Oh Ned, give me a break.
Well I...
You see?
There have been crashes and disappearances.
But the real story is, what they found at the last crash.
Probably broken off the body some place.
What are you talking about.
Something that must incredibly, unbelievably huge.
An Insect?
Here.
It looks like the spur on the leg of a grasshopper or a cricket.
If that is part of an insect...
Are you sure you are feeling alright?
there were long skid marks in the snow as... as though the thing flew in for a landing.
Jackson talking.
Oh hello Professor Gunther.
You have.
I see sir, thank you.
Well they just finished the blood tests.
There were no red corpuscles.
... and the ant inside this amber is at least 90 million years old.
That certain ancient insect forms have continued without variation until today.
That others have changed to meet changing conditions and certain species have vanished completely.
Look behind you on the wall professor.
That prehistoric dragonfly measures 2 feet from wing tip to wing tip.
... and like the modern dragonfly, it too was a flesh eater.
Is that the best you can do?
I never suggested I was looking for a dragonfly.
So what are you looking for?
The field of pathology is limited.
But the paleontologist field is narrow to what we understand.
On the contrary we stretch our understanding to, try and take in the universe.
alright, suppose, just for the sake of argument that we admit such an insect once existed.
How could it be alive today?
Exactly!
Even the recently discovered prehistoric Siberian mammals were dead.
The natives ate the flesh, used the skin for clothing, made tools from the ivory tusks.
But the mammoths were dead.
Are you sure they were dead?
Why?
Everyone knows they were.
Everyone says they were.
Suppose they were still alive when found in the ice.
Does your learned young friend always go on like this?
alright professor,
Which always happens when death occurs.
Theoretically yes.
Is it unreasonable then to ask yourself...
Whether the mammoths might have remained alive all those years, ... and it was the Siberians who killed them before they had a chance to thaw out and breathe again!
You... you believe this?
Look, five men have vanished.
To die is one thing.
To disappear without a trace suggests... complete destruction!
A flesh eating creature!
But there are scores of insects that live on other insects.
Where do you start?
By thinking of the hook as though it were infinitely smaller.
As though it were part of an insect no larger than those we know today.
Like oh, the grasshopper, the beetle, or the cricket, then ask yourself...
What flesh eating insect of normal size, has such a hook?
Every paleontologist does.
Look, you start with a jaw bone, a couple of teeth, you figure whether they come from a flesh or a grass eater and you go from there!
A normal insect, that is a flesh eater.
The diet consist mostly of small insects such as leafhoppers, grasshoppers, caterpillars and others.
A substantial part of the diet may also include small frogs and lizards.
Now the hook they found on the plane may very well be a spur from one of its forelegs.
If this is it, as large as a monstrous creature we looking for I doubt whether anything that ever lived could be as deadly.
It walks, leaps, and flies.
You mean, this cute little bug?
Yeah, that cute little bug.
In all the kingdom of the living there is no more deadly or voracious creature.
... than the Preying Mantis.
GREENLAND ESKIMOS TERRORIZED
Anything new on the disaster, General?
Nothing else gentlemen.
Well what have you been called in for?
Dr. Jackson is an old friend of mine.
Have you any theories Dr. Jackson?
Gentlemen, if you were in my position and what you had was a theory, not facts, just a theory,
I know I can count on all of you.
Well, Good luck to you Ned.
Hi!
Almost ready?
If can close this.
Here, make yourself useful.
Nice of you to see me off.
I think so.
Are those mine too?
Oh...
Yours?
My what?
I guess he forgot to tell you.
Boy this is really going to be a story.
Almost.
Well come on!
Colonel.
Colonel, sir.
Uh, Dr. Jackson is here from ah, Washington.
We...
Well speak up!
A female woman.
Then show them in.
Yes sir.
Excuse me, this is Miss Marjorie Blain;
Colonel Joe Parkman.
El General Ford sent me up.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, that will be all men.
Ah we have a little joke up here...
Only try and find a tree.
Well when do we see what we came for.
Fine.
These are the skid marks.
We found the same marks at the weather shack, and the Eskimo village.
Here Colonel.
Got it?
Eight and a half feet.
At ease.
Gentlemen, this is Marjorie Blaine.
Light and crosses absolutely boss.
Yes Corporal?
Well, ah, with your permission sir...
Would it be alright if...
would it be alright if I asked Miss Blaine to dance, sir?
Corporal that decision is entirely up to Miss Blaine.
Yes sir.
Miss Blaine would you care to...
Oh hi.
Hi.
Hi Ned.
Thought you were going to join us.
You two run along, have fun.
What are you up to?
You know, people used to think that carnivorous plants were the funk.
Actually there are about 450 species of them.
Some are almost 6 feet tall.
Well those who have are dead!
Ah, who can be sure?
It may have been locked in a prison of ice millions of years ago.
Well what could have released it after all that time?
Oh, any sort of unusual vibration,
You know how, mountain climbers are afraid of thunder?
Hit the alert button!
Yes sir!
Operations!
Colonel Parkman speaking...
Condition Red!
Scramble all aircraft immediately!
Condition Red!
Coffee Colonel?
Nine hours and not a whisper.
Which is alright with me.
Red Eagle One, this is Otter 4
Hello Otter 4, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead.
We have nothing here.
Request permission to return to base.
Over.
Request denied, continue search procedure.
Over and out.
And remember I want a report on anything from Mid Canada, or Pine tree.
Anything.
You understand?
Yes sir.
Got the Mid Canada Radar Fence on the line sir.
This is Colonel Parkman.
Oh Colonel, Blue Captain Hawkins, here.
This is just a stab in the dark but you chaps asked us to report anything unusual and... yes...
As I said, it may not mean a thing, but we caught an unidentified object in our scope.
Could have been a storm or a weather balloon.
It was a faint signal that came a West.
But it might be that oversized bug of yours?
What time was it?
Early.
Zero four hundred I suspect.
Thanks Hawkins.
Thanks very much.
Why not Joe?
The deer fly does 600 an hour!
The Mid Canada line is 1500 miles South of here, right?
Right.
And, where was that Weather shack 4?
Right there, straight on the eightieth meridian.
And the, and the C47 crash was here.
What are you getting at Ned?
And the Eskimo village?
Right there, between us and the C47.
Hey wait a minute.
Thanks.
This is Colonel Parkman.
Are you sure?
Thanks.
Pine Tree got it too.
It went through Newfoundland.
Come on Marge.
Grab your toothbrush.
All over the United States this morning...
Some 400,000 members, of the civilian ground observer corp are gathered to learn more about this fantastic creature.
This program is being presented by the Continental Air Defense Command.
Our first speaker is Major General Mark Ford.
Thank you.
I want to say at the outset...
That contrary to rumor, and certain newspaper headlines, the so called deadly Mantis is no imaginary scare.
With me this morning is Colonel Parkman.
Commanding officer of an advanced radar interceptor base deep in the Arctic Circle.
Colonel Parkman.
Thank you sir.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
I saw this creature attack our base.
I visited the weather shack, and I also inspected the wreckage of the aircraft that this thing destroyed.
Now we have every reason to believe that the Mantis is flying South...
Along the Gulf Stream.
And we believe that it will be one you devoted men and women of the Civilian Ground Observer Corp who will spot it next time it appears.
I have with me today Dr. Nedrick Jackson...
Curator of the department of Paleontology at the Museum of Natural History.
Dr. Jackson has something important to show you.
Doctor.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
This object, is a spur broken off the fore leg of the Mantis when it destroyed the C47.
Thank you, doctor.
Now you ground observers are well trained in the identification of aircraft.
Here, to scale, is the deadly Mantis, and here, is the C47, which it destroyed.
One other thing.
You spotters should listen for a loud droning sound, much like that of a squadron of heavy bombers flying in formation.
Now the Coast Guard and the Navy have been alerted and are standing by...
On the Eastern seaboard.
If the Mantis is sited the procedure will be the same as though an enemy aircraft had been spotted.
Take no chances.
Report any unusual flying objects.
Thank you.
Target is down!
Target is down!
Cannot confirm kill, due to low overcast.
Returning to Carrier.
Out.
Well, here comes another one.
Granary fire in Minneapolis.
Minneapolis not a stir.
Richmond Virginia?
Yeah.
Fresno, Fresno...
Where is Fresno?
California?
Fresno, California.
Hi.
Hi Marge.
Hello.
Ned.
Hey, what are you up to?
We call it operation Marge because she dreamed it up.
Oh?
Some may have been caused by the Mantis.
This might give us a clue.
Any luck?
You kids know what time it is.
But General I have the...
You heard what the General said.
Your going straight home young lady.
Night Ned.
Goodnight Marge.

Hey smart guy, I thought I told you to stay out of that road, now come on get back there!
Yeah, tell it to your neighbor will ya!
Shut it off!
Well we got about a 90 percent saturation of smoke in the tunnel now!
Those wet tarpaulins will hold the smoke alright.
Just keep pumping!
what about the smoke?
Did you go inside?
How far in do you estimate it to be?
That puts the Mantis below the water line.
What do you think Ned?
Is there anything between us and the Mantis on this end?
17 cars, according to the automatic counter.
What do you say, General?
Go ahead, Joe.
Good luck Joe.
Alright men.
Now the purpose of that smoke in there is to give us cover.
Use it!
Now which of you men is carrying the chemical mines?
Stay up front with me!
And remember, those 3-R-G mines are effective only in a limited area.
So watch for my signal before you throw them.
Alright men, Take Masks!
Well go on, take your picture.
Who me?
Well nothing at all.
Can I help you with the Camera?
No thanks.
Exactly where did you crash into him, Joe?
Well, just about center of the right hand side.
There.
I think you can see right there, sir.
Ned what do you call...
Look out Marge!
I thought you said you killed him?
Here, put me down.
I said, put me down!
Well, that can wait.
This is no place for romance Joe Parkman.
What about my pictures?
Let Ned do it.
ha, ha, ha, ha....
Yucatán Verbatim, 23.976 fps.
Follow the river
The river knows the way
Come to me, I pray
I miss you more each day
Follow the river
Wherever you may be
Follow the river back to me
Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
And tell the sky above
Does it matter how full the moon
Bring back the great love
The love that once we knew
Make my dreams come true
The dream I had with you
Follow the river
Wherever you may be
Follow the river back to me
Follow the river
Wherever you may be
Follow the river back to me?
Howdy, folks.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
McLaine!
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
Playing cards with matches?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
(?
Folk tune)
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
If you had two cents!
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
Consider yourself lucky.
Play what you please.
(?
Lively jig)
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
?
I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
?
So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
?
And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
Here.
You read it.
Urgent.
No.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
Much obliged.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
Uh-huh.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
What for are you mixing in?
Break any bones, son?
You want a lift?
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
I can pay for the pie.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
Now when did you see him last?
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
You got an omelette coming up.
Come on.
That means you.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
Want me to play a tune for you?
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
I want you to ride it.
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
Yes.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
Uh-uh.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
He said that.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
No.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
Grant.
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
I hope you have a nice trip.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
All right.
You can come along.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
You wanting to get on that car?
Here.
Otherwise ride the flats.
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
(?
Folk tune)
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
They just follow the river.
He had a little song about it.
?
Follow the river
?
The river knows the way
?
Hearts can go astray
?
It happens every day
?
Follow the river
?
Wherever you may be
?
Follow the river back to me?
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
The Utica Kid.
Even crazier than he is!
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Here.
Hold on to that.
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
Sure.
Come on.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
I asked you did you see him?
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
Or would you like to try?
And you know something?
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
Why?
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
Why not?
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
Or do you want a recount?
Sorry, the bar is closed.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
?
So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
?
And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
?
Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
?
And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
?
?
?
?
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
Torgenson!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Leary!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
Same as last time!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
Funny man!
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
Ladies is always first.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Whitey!
How come you missed out?
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Go on.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
You can bring it to me.
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
You gonna leave him here?
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
Which one do I ride with?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Give you a lift?
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
It used to be called Pay Load.
See the second one?
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
Did you bring the payroll?
Who wants your man?
Get back to work!
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
Ha ha!
That you made a mistake.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
Latigo, I want a drink!
Settle down.
I can see you.
I got it off your own bar.
Suppose I join you?
I watched you walk.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
I may not send you back.
You like another drink?
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
His name?
My family used to call me Lee.
Come out with your hands up.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
Not this kind.
Soon.
He just looked at me and smiled.
Tonight he has his answer.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
Grant...
Leave it alone!
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
What did Kimball say?
I came on my own.
Why?
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Any further objections?
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
I figured as much.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
He got the start that way too, huh?
Not when he takes your road.
Why bother?
Give Joey a chance.
No.
Think about her.
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
When?
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Why not?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now I get it from you!
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
No.
Grant was right.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
(?
?
?
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
?
There are tracks across the prairie
?
Where the buzzard builds his nest
?
There are tracks across the Rockies
?
To the Golden West?
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
After me.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
All right.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
I count mine.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
Now go on.
Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
And tell the sky above
Does it matter how full the moon
Follow the river
Wherever you may be
Follow the river back to me

Do you good, make you grow.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
You wanting to get on that car?
Here.
Otherwise ride the flats.
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
They just follow the river.
He had a little song about it.

Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
The Utica Kid.
Even crazier than he is!
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Here.
Hold on to that.
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
Sure.
Come on.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
I asked you did you see him?
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
Or would you like to try?
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
Why?
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
Why not?
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
Or do you want a recount?
Sorry, the bar is closed.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
SoI boughtmyselfashovel and I bought myself a pick
AndI laidalittletrack along the bullfrog crick
ThenI builtalocomotive out of 20 empty cans
AndI tootedon thewhistle and the darned thing ran
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
Torgenson!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Leary!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
Same as last time!
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
Funny man!
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
Ladies is always first.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Whitey!
How come you missed out?
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
You can bring it to me.
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr. Shannon!
Give you a lift?
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
It used to be called Pay Load.
See the second one?
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
Did you bring the payroll?
Who wants your man?
Get back to work!
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
Ha ha!
That you made a mistake.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
Latigo, I want a drink!
Settle down.
I can see you.
I got it off your own bar.
Suppose I join you?
I watched you walk.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognize all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
I may not send you back.
You like another drink?
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
His name?
My family used to call me Lee.
Come out with your hands up.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
Is there any reason why he should?
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
Not this kind.
Soon.
He just looked at me and smiled.
Tonight he has his answer.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
Grant...
Leave it alone!
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
What did Kimball say?
I came on my own.
Why?
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Any further objections?
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
I figured as much.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
He got the start that way too, huh?
Not when he takes your road.
Why bother?
Give Joey a chance.
No.
Think about her.
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
When?
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Why not?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now I get it from you!
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
No.
Grant was right.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?

How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbors
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
After me.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
All right.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
I count mine.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What?
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
Now go on.

Howdy, folks.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
McLaine!
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
Playing cards with matches?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
(?
Folk tune)
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
If you had two cents!
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
Consider yourself lucky.
Play what you please.
(?
Lively jig)
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
?
I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
?
So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
?
And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
Here.
You read it.
Urgent.
No.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
Much obliged.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
Uh-huh.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
What for are you mixing in?
Break any bones, son?
You want a lift?
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
I can pay for the pie.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
Now when did you see him last?
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
You got an omelette coming up.
Come on.
That means you.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
Want me to play a tune for you?
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
I want you to ride it.
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
Yes.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
Uh-uh.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
He said that.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
No.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
Grant.
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
I hope you have a nice trip.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
All right.
You can come along.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
Hey, Pilgrim!

Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?

?
Follow the river
?
The river knows the way
?
Hearts can go astray
?
It happens every day
?
Follow the river
?
Wherever you may be
?
Follow the river back to me?
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
No.
I was in Montrose.

She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
?
So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
?
And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
?
Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
?
And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
?
?
?
?
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
Torgenson!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.

A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
Ha ha!
That you made a mistake.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
Latigo, I want a drink!
Settle down.
I can see you.

How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
When?
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Why not?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now I get it from you!
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
No.
Grant was right.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
(?
?
?
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
?
There are tracks across the prairie
?
Where the buzzard builds his nest
?
There are tracks across the Rockies
?
To the Golden West?
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
After me.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
All right.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
I count mine.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
Now go on.
Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
And tell the sky above
Does it matter how full the moon
Follow the river
Wherever you may be
Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Come to me, I pray
# I miss you more each day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# Bring back the great love
# The love that once we knew
# Make my dreams come true
# The dream I had with you
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Howdy, folks.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
McLaine!
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
Playing cards with matches?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
If you had two cents!
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
Consider yourself lucky.
Play what you please.
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
# I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
# So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
# And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
Here.
You read it.
Urgent.
No.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
Much obliged.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
Uh-huh.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
What for are you mixing in?
Break any bones, son?
You want a lift?
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
I can pay for the pie.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
Now when did you see him last?
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
You got an omelette coming up.
Come on.
That means you.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
Want me to play a tune for you?
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
I want you to ride it.
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
Yes.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
Uh-uh.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
He said that.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
No.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
Grant.
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
I hope you have a nice trip.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
All right.
You can come along.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
You wanting to get on that car?
Here.
Otherwise ride the flats.
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
They just follow the river.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
The Utica Kid.
Even crazier than he is!
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Here.
Hold on to that.
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
Sure.
Come on.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
I asked you did you see him?
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
Or would you like to try?
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
Why?
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
Why not?
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
Or do you want a recount?
Sorry, the bar is closed.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
Torgenson!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Leary!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
Same as last time!
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
Funny man!
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
Ladies is always first.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Whitey!
How come you missed out?
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
You can bring it to me.
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Give you a lift?
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
It used to be called Pay Load.
See the second one?
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
Did you bring the payroll?
Who wants your man?
Get back to work!
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
Ha ha!
That you made a mistake.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
Latigo, I want a drink!
Settle down.
I can see you.
I got it off your own bar.
Suppose I join you?
I watched you walk.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
I may not send you back.
You like another drink?
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
His name?
My family used to call me Lee.
Come out with your hands up.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
Is there any reason why he should?
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
Not this kind.
Soon.
He just looked at me and smiled.
Tonight he has his answer.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
Grant...
Leave it alone!
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
What did Kimball say?
I came on my own.
Why?
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Any further objections?
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
I figured as much.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
He got the start that way too, huh?
Not when he takes your road.
Why bother?
Give Joey a chance.
No.
Think about her.
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
When?
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Why not?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now I get it from you!
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
No.
Grant was right.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track

# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies

You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.

Get a bucket and start carrying water.

Howdy, folks.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
McLaine!
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
Playing cards with matches?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?

Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
If you had two cents!

And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
Much obliged.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
No, just a few pieces at a time.

Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
Want me to play a tune for you?
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
I want you to ride it.
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
Yes.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
Uh-uh.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
He said that.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
No.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
Grant.
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
I hope you have a nice trip.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
All right.
You can come along.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
You wanting to get on that car?
Here.
Otherwise ride the flats.
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
They just follow the river.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
The Utica Kid.
Even crazier than he is!
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Here.
Hold on to that.
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
Sure.
Come on.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
I asked you did you see him?
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
Or would you like to try?
And you know something?
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
Why?
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
Why not?
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
Or do you want a recount?
Sorry, the bar is closed.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
Torgenson!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Leary!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
Same as last time!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
Funny man!
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
Ladies is always first.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Whitey!
How come you missed out?
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Go on.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
You can bring it to me.
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
You gonna leave him here?
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
Which one do I ride with?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Give you a lift?
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
It used to be called Pay Load.
See the second one?
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
Did you bring the payroll?
Who wants your man?
Get back to work!
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
Ha ha!
That you made a mistake.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
Latigo, I want a drink!
Settle down.
I can see you.
I got it off your own bar.
Suppose I join you?
I watched you walk.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
I may not send you back.
You like another drink?
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
His name?
My family used to call me Lee.
Come out with your hands up.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
Not this kind.
Soon.
He just looked at me and smiled.
Tonight he has his answer.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
Grant...
Leave it alone!
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
What did Kimball say?
I came on my own.
Why?
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Any further objections?
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
I figured as much.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
He got the start that way too, huh?
Not when he takes your road.
Why bother?
Give Joey a chance.
No.
Think about her.
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
When?
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Why not?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now I get it from you!
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
No.
Grant was right.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# There are tracks across the prairie
# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies
# To the Golden West #
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
After me.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
All right.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
I count mine.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
Now go on.

Howdy, folks.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
McLaine!
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
Playing cards with matches?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their rail road.
Am I right?
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your rail road.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
If you had two cents!
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
Consider yourself lucky.
Play what you please.
Hee-hee!

Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
Here.
You read it.
Urgent.
No.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
Much obliged.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the rail road to reach them.
First I was.
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Makes a mighty fine shod cut into town.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
What for are you mixing in?
You want a lift?
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, son of heavyset?
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
I can pay for the pie.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the rail road.
I guess a lot of people follow the rail road.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
Now when did you see him last?
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
You belong to the rail road and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
You got an omelette coming up.
Come on.
That means you.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
Want me to play a tune for you?
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.

A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Was she pretty?
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
Ha ha!
That you made a mistake.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
Latigo, I want a drink!
Settle down.

I may not send you back.
You like another drink?
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
His name?
My family used to call me Lee.
Come out with your hands up.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
ls there any reason why he should?
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
Not this kind.
Soon.
He just looked at me and smiled.
Tonight he has his answer.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
Well, then, why?
Because of a little thing called self-respect.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
Grant...
Leave it alone!
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
What did Kimball say?
I came on my own.
Why?
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
You see, when a man gets fired off the rail road, he has a little trouble finding a job.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Any further objections?
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
I figured as much.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
He got the start that way too?
Not when he takes your road.
Why bother?
Give Joey a chance.
No.
Think about her.
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
When?
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Why not?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now I get it from you!
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
No.
Grant was right.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey
Go on.
Play some more.

How does it go from there, Lee?

In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
Gentlemen!
Your memory is quite shod.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
After me.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the rail road!
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
All right.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the rail road.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
I count mine.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
Now go on.

Darling.
Come on.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Why?
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
A few years of school...
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
Well, have a good shoot.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
I want to shoot the gun too.
Lathela.
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
But you never, never argue with them.
We grew up together.
Not in our lifetime.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
White magic will not remove the curse.
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
CROWN COUNSEL:
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
Turn to something else for help.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
My daughter will visit you.
Please keep this for me.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
No, bwana.
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
His son, Kimani.
I want him found.
You want him found, what are the charges?
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
Maybe everything.
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
No.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
LITTLE JEFF:
What did you bring?
Hello.
LITTLE JEFF:
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
How many goats will be paid for me?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
Do you accept my son?
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
On the farm.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
What is it?
Something strange.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
Probably the fuse again.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
Remember me?
Kimani.
Jeff!
No.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
Yes.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
Meyli.
Who was with you?
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
GAME WARDEN:
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
Now, listen, man.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black or white.
Well?
All right.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
All right.
How?
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
LITTLE JEFF:
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
Absolutely right.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
He probably never had a chance.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
So am I.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
I feel empty.
Dead.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
Well?
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Ngai is angry.
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
You are afraid to face your god.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
GAME WARDEN:
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
GAME WARDEN:
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
The old man says yes.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
Yes.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
Why did you come?
He confessed many things, told us many names.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
Only when we take them.
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
You like a drink?
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
I asked her to go.
She was...
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
Anything wrong?
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
No, I was to blame.
You just gotta live in it.
Oh.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Why?
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
But they gave their word.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Come back with me.
No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.

Darling.
Come on.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Why?
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
A few years of school...
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
Well, have a good shoot.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
I want to shoot the gun too.
Lathela.
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
But you never, never argue with them.
We grew up together.
Not in our lifetime.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
White magic will not remove the curse.
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
Turn to something else for help.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
The city frightens me.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
My daughter will visit you.
Please keep this for me.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
No, bwana.
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
His son, Kimani.
I want him found.
You want him found, what are the charges?
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
Maybe everything.
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
No.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
Would you mind letting us by, please?
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
What did you bring?
Hello.
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
How many goats will be paid for me?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
Do you accept my son?
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
On the farm.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
What is it?
Something strange.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
Probably the fuse again.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
Remember me?
Kimani.
Jeff!
No.
Kimani.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
Yes.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
Meyli.
Who was with you?
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
Now, listen, man.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black or white.
Well?
All right.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
All right.
How?
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
Absolutely right.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
He probably never had a chance.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
So am I.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
I feel empty.
Dead.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
Well?
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Ngai is angry.
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
You are afraid to face your god.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
The old man says yes.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
Yes.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
Why did you come?
He confessed many things, told us many names.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
Only when we take them.
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
You like a drink?
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
I asked her to go.
She was...
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
Anything wrong?
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
No, I was to blame.
You just gotta live in it.
Oh.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Why?
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
But they gave their word.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Come back with me.
No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.

Darling.
Come on.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Why?
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
A few years of school...
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
Well, have a good shoot.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
I want to shoot the gun too.
Lathela.
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
But you never, never argue with them.
We grew up together.
Not in our lifetime.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
White magic will not remove the curse.
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
Turn to something else for help.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
The city frightens me.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
My daughter will visit you.
Please keep this for me.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
No, bwana.
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
His son, Kimani.
I want him found.
You want him found, what are the charges?
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
Maybe everything.
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
No.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
Would you mind letting us by, please?
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
What did you bring?
Hello.
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
How many goats will be paid for me?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
Do you accept my son?
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
On the farm.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
What is it?
Something strange.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
Probably the fuse again.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
Remember me?
Kimani.
Jeff!
No.
Kimani.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
Yes.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
Meyli.
Who was with you?
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
Now, listen, man.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black or white.
Well?
All right.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
All right.
How?
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
Absolutely right.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
He probably never had a chance.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
So am I.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
I feel empty.
Dead.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
Well?
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Ngai is angry.
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
You are afraid to face your god.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
The old man says yes.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
Yes.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
Why did you come?
He confessed many things, told us many names.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
Only when we take them.
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
You like a drink?
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
I asked her to go.
She was...
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
Anything wrong?
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
No, I was to blame.
You just gotta live in it.
Oh.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Why?
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
But they gave their word.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Come back with me.
No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Darling.
Come on.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Why?
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
A few years of school...
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
Well, have a good shoot.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
I want to shoot the gun too.
Lathela.
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
But you never, never argue with them.
We grew up together.
Not in our lifetime.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
White magic will not remove the curse.
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
CROWN COUNSEL:
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
Turn to something else for help.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
My daughter will visit you.
Please keep this for me.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
No, bwana.
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
His son, Kimani.
I want him found.
You want him found, what are the charges?
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
Maybe everything.
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
No.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
LITTLE JEFF:
What did you bring?
Hello.
LITTLE JEFF:
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
How many goats will be paid for me?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
Do you accept my son?
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
On the farm.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
What is it?
Something strange.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
Probably the fuse again.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
Remember me?
Kimani.
Jeff!
No.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
Yes.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
Meyli.
Who was with you?
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
GAME WARDEN:
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
Now, listen, man.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black or white.
Well?
All right.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
All right.
How?
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
LITTLE JEFF:
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
Absolutely right.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
He probably never had a chance.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
So am I.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
I feel empty.
Dead.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
Well?
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Ngai is angry.
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
You are afraid to face your god.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
GAME WARDEN:
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
GAME WARDEN:
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
The old man says yes.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
Yes.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
Why did you come?
He confessed many things, told us many names.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
Only when we take them.
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
You like a drink?
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
I asked her to go.
She was...
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
Anything wrong?
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
No, I was to blame.
You just gotta live in it.
Oh.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Why?
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
But they gave their word.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Come back with me.
No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.

Warning!
Give out!
Let pass, madam!
Pass!
Come!
Where is the farce Marcella?
Her brother.
You also guessing on a glass bowl and tea leaves?
If only, I do not believe that any penny.
In any case, things you better than mine.
My name Kvedchi.
Once I was an acrobat - I jumped from 12 meters into the bath.
A one night missed.
Since then - not worth a fig.
Keep.
I mended your pad.
Can you portray Lovelace evening.
I do not work the shoulder muscles more.
But the language works.
There.
The second trailer for the circus.
Thank you.
Go and prosperous branch of the family.
So smartly dressed!
Or a policeman or a thug.
But it expressed pretty well.
So bandit.
How do I see you has kept the family tradition.
How do you come from?
From prison.
A little rest in 6 months.
Clutter, shorter.
I wonder, when will you grow up and poumneesh?
Change the record, okay?
Give the best drink.
The buffet has a wine.
Wait a minute.
Oh, nothing.
Fatigue.
Heart...
It is you not the weakest link.
You know, all of this - the word.
We fight, finding fault, but generally...
We love each other, no?
Here we are!
I need you, yes?
Yes.
I...
I would have to...
I have to hide for a few days.
But do not worry.
Do not the cops.
So much the better.
Because here strictly look after us.
Fair - is a disease of the gendarmes.
No one knows why.
How do you think you can get me a job?
You are not going to tell me that looking for a job?
I was in prison.
I do not play face-down.
I have already told you about my former friend - gang Richoni?
They cranked a small business.
It is not weak.
We took a big jackpot - 14 million.
Wow!
Give me my pills.
There, in a box.
14 million - is hiding.
You - the shelter that I know.
You stole prey?
When you want to settle down, it takes money.
But do not worry, my friends about anything not guess.
Even the fact that I was known for their cache.
They are there, for sure, not see for several days, and during this time...
During this time?
I do not know, complications may occur, minor disassembly...
Accidents at work...
You sold them ?
!
I sell?
No.
Passed.
Do not you think the same, for the sake of the 14 million I will stand on ceremony?
14 million...
Can you imagine?
They will quickly realize which way the wind blows, if they have a head on their shoulders.
To get the moolah, they killed two agents and three passers-by.
So, believe me, my head on his shoulders at them - only temporarily.
The main thing that I could sit in the shelter,
Until they are caught.
Will you take stolen money ?
!
You would divide wrongfully acquired?
Would deprive his brother ?
!
What about your sister?
Will not work, there is no fuel.
Okay.
Come descend to Cinco.
It is the owner of the circus.
And it is more than one, - he owes me money.
Just hoof ragged.
It is necessary to treat with ointment.
Or maybe to get started is to call the vet?
Vet?
And why not pedicurists?
Do you think I have little parasites on contentment?
Come on, shoo!
Take it from here.
But mother and Marcella.
Again, probably came to knock out money from the owner.
Who is she?
And it is quite personal.
This is your show?
Oh well!
Cinco!
A, Marcella, my beauty!
Only you are not on time.
You just do not think I have my bad intentions.
Long for me - is sacred, but...
Do you still have no barkers?
And soon there will be nothing at all.
Things are deteriorating, people no longer go to the circus...
And you know why?
Exactly!
Circus offered to them right at home.
They baldeyut home with his family.
This is for him?
This is my brother, Fernand Bastia.
You do me a favor, if You take it.
To work for me, you must be hungry.
And I know how to be grateful.
Just keep in mind - here you are not a farce.
It is necessary not only to be a greeter.
I must still be helpful.
And much work to do here.
And in response to the generosity of Cinco:
2000 francs per week, and grubs.
2000!
Are you kidding ?
!
You pay the guy the previous 5!
And nearly bankrupt, with such a breadth of US!
Do you want to take it or not.
It you take a piece of bread!
Madeleine!
Take this guy for Dario.
Will live with him!
Tell me, do you want?
Yes, after the closing.
I can not walk after 10.
Okay, come when you want.
Something will think.
Oh, unwound, my mother is coming!
Lets go faster!
All the time an eyesore, and all the time with a servant!
All in father!
That did not stop my father to marry...
Society lady!
This small palace!
You must have not often worked in the circus?
How long are you going to stay here?
What?
Nothing.
Just like that.
And why did you suddenly decide to come here?
I am looking for work.
So bad luck, you found it.
Way or not?
I am looking for work and found.
What is your name?
And this - my trailer.
Only with flowers.
Since then, as the Cinco cut staff, I live alone.
This has its cons and pros...
.
Dario?
Dario!
Who else?
This brother Marcella.
Cinco hired him greeter.
Come here!
My name is Philip.
Philip Dario.
You surely have heard about me.
Of course!
There is no more room.
See you later.
Well, welcome...
Come!
Make yourself at home!
Your predecessor was sleeping on the right side,
If you have a preference or superstition...
No, no!
Take the couch, I will build on the cot.
Stella - this is my daughter.
Hey, Mom!
Mama!
What do you want?
The next...
Well, satisfied with their housing?
Oh, yes!
More than sugary hard to think!
Could get me anywhere else!
Where is it?
The trailer Marcella?
No...
I would have liked more than another.
Here is how?
What?
I do not know.
For example, the one with the flowers.
Beautiful colors, pleasant company and smells good...
For example, waking up in the morning, at breakfast...
When I as a child - More and croissants.
What are you laughing at?
A can converge see your trailer?
No.
Not now.
I have to go.
There will be a bakery, there will be no croissants.
All this chatter!
He must be somewhere!
Good.
We here will not uyd置.
A curtain!
It is nowhere seen.
Thinly noticed!
I do not whether you think that it will be waiting for us on the terrace of a cafe?
Pour a mug.
They I have always, and it is ill-advised.
For ideas - as friends, they should not be too much.
Hello?
Yes.
A?
What?
Yes.
Yes, I know!
Well, where is she?
Thank you.
What?
The name of his sister - Marcella fortune-telling.
Where she lives, this abnormal?
Powered by miserable fairs in provincial towns.
You will not find a cigarette?
What if he did not go to his Sis?
Now, with attendants, that it may fall down abroad.
Well, call Jojo.
You bastard!
He passed us!
Open!
Police!
Yes, all right, go to sleep.
I have played so!
Brigade for the Protection of morality!
O, it happens with them.
Open.
They better not mess with.
Ugolovka!
Hands up!
Hands up!
Well, Richoni?
What you say?
This time you got burned.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
No way!
Shoot, guys!
Shoot anything that moves!
What are you!
They have there just waiting for you!
Bastards!
In the hatch!
Faster!
Surrender!
I give you 2 minutes!
Now you can not rush.
To taste?
There is a way out?
What about the others?
As you said, friends should not be too much.
Exactly.
It would be nice.
Here!
Come executed by my 2000 francs!
Great idea!
With celebrities such as...
Madeleine, Gina, Stella and Dario ... and...
And also with the rest of the troupe!
If you think so you can get people to go to...
Just listen, as it should!
Come, ladies and gentlemen!
Come!
Cinco The circus - a circus, not like the others!
No billboards, no ads, no idle talk!
Just an idea!
We could show you 100 rooms!
These we have.
But we will show you only 10, but only with the stars!
Here Freni - Empress nudity!
Artistic art, in other words, educational,
Which you can watch the children.
Lovely Gina - goddess of dance!
You go?
Do not talk just started!
Lovely Gina - goddess of dance!
Dario and Stella - trapeze artists!
Calling gravity, puzzling scientists!
Mario - magnetic juggler!
Man flying pins!
Amedee and his dog, a tightrope walker!
Riri Fifi and clowns!
Finally, Mademoiselle Josiane - perfect woman!
And besides - daughter of yours truly!
Come, ladies and gentlemen!
Come!
This Circus Cinco - the only circus in the world, which they say friends!
Come in, come in, ladies and gentlemen!
The best places - 300 francs!
Military and children - 100 francs!
Come in, come in!
The show begins!
This, ladies and gentlemen!
d?
e.
Do you want some coffee?
No.
No, thanks, I already drank.
Listen, you do not have a newspaper?
Bulk!
And you do not have one, but...
today?
No.
I, you know, they just build up the fire, so...
Good morning!
Well, Dad, we do not work this morning?
Works.
But I had to repair the suspension strap.
Hey, yesterday I had no time to introduce you to Stella, my daughter.
We are preparing with a single number.
Number stunning!
Listen, I want to walk.
You do not have another key?
Why?
What is there to steal?
Yes, of course...
Well, Dario, your tenant already awake?
Half...
Such a strange type.
I do not know what time he arrived yesterday.
Sleeps dressed.
Maybe he a lunatic!
Oh yeah...
View Gina tired.
Perhaps she, too, a lunatic?
You could have knocked!
Still, good morning!
Well, you can not be the same day and at night.
Have to evening dance with the long sleeves.
You guided me bruises.
Do you want to tell you one stupid?
Well, tell me.
I really like you.
You do not have to answer me, in turn,
Maybe it was just a nice night, just for you...
I wanted to tell you...
I mean, if you want...
You would not mind every night dance with long sleeves?
Here!
Go!
Welcome!
No, well, you see?
Once he has a grandmother, it can no longer shake hands?
If he had a grandmother, he would not have worked for Cinco.
Teach by heart?
What?
Article about the fight at Pigalle.
3rd time already read.
Well, everything ?
!
Are you at home?
Check the pockets?
We follow the mail?
Would wait until I take a subscription before removing the meter reading!
These are your friends?
Why are you hiding?
Who are you afraid of?
Imagine, I do not like the slap.
Oh, forgive me!
You read that five were killed.
If you do not know them, why do you have such a person?
Because the other two.
Are you saying that you would be staged 7 dead?
You are strongly capable in the long run.
You got me with that thing!
END OF THE GAME
Do not be angry!
Waiter!
Stubborn around, huh?
Okay, come on.
You got into something bad, Fernand.
Oh!
Love - it is so beautiful.
Why do you say that?
Because you know that those types, which finished off, participated in the robbery of Marseille.
What the police did not find 14 million francs.
So you talk.
And since you are able to run, you divide 14 2.
Yesterday you took me for a bandit,
And you liked it.
Today you take me for a sucker, and you like it even more.
I had a good night, Gina, but...
Than 14 million.
I simply offer you my assistance.
Help to spend it?
See?
Do you believe that everything has already happened.
Wronged?
You too cunning for me, Fernand.
Talking to himself, and makes me tired.
I was fascinated, but wrong.
It happens.
Goodbye and good luck!
A pack of cigarettes.
Thank you.
Time is right, kids!
Hurry!
I feel sorry for Gina, she sunk down on a guy.
What is she in it found in this clown?
I do not understand.
If I were in your place, I would know what to do.
You have returned the money that I have a year must be his sister?
All work!
And with a soul!
And with enthusiasm!
Revenue today should be good!
You know my number with Stella
Ready.
This could save you.
Oh, wait a minute.
Posters fine, but it is not important...
For instance, I just thought...
What are you doing here?
Why?
Because you suggest it to all the girls.
But others - this is nonsense, does not mean anything.
Why would I be honest?
Because I love you.
Yes, you know it.
And this is life.
Do you want to be the only one with whom I do not want to sleep?
No, it is illogical to do everything!
Leave me alone!
What if I talk to your dad?
But for now, if he catches you in his trailer, he kicks your ass.
At once.
And in the church!
White dress, green plants, red carpet.
And the gatekeeper!
Well, I agree?
I am too poor, right?
Bastia?
Come help me prepare tickets.
You then asked.
I do not know.
The man who got out of the black car.
Only that will see you later.
And... he looked like?
In your style.
The style that we do not like, let it be known.
Thank you!
Thank you very much, that I was warned.
At the same time I will spare 2000 francs.
Even 5000 - I add myself a salary.
All the places for the parade!
Are you going to go?
We do not prevent, I hope?
Pepe feared hurt.
However, Pepe?
Yeah.
Ogonyok not find?
Yes.
You with Pepe lucky.
We lucky!
In our country such a friend like you!
We were wrong?
I was sure that we can count on you!
We Pepe plans to leave, but not enough money.
You know life - without the money does not go far.
But...
I have no money!
To tell where to find them.
Or rather, it is to remind you.
The last six months I was stunned.
I decided to change my life.
It is necessary to give up the old life to doing good, huh?
You will have a pleasant memory.
And it will be nice to Pepe.
The money is still in a place that you know.
Converge zaber群h and come back.
What if I caught?
On Piga, certainly, full of cops.
Do you know them!
I mean...
Do you know how to behave.
And then - you did not participate in Marseilles, so... 14 million for four - This is good, no?
A for the three do not want to?
Yes, it is tempting...
But very risky.
From my pedigree, I can get 10 years.
Understand me, Fredo...
Only Pepe will not be happy.
Pepe - he was.
I have to reason with him.
For example, at 7 pm.
Then - descends Pepe.
Go away?
Keep an eye on him.
You do not have to say.
But what did he want?
Money.
Do you hear?
I behaved with you is disgusting.
You could throw me.
I understand it now, because I start to see more clearly.
Because you are satisfied with it.
Imagine that also suits me.
How was I to guess that you have money?
I loved you with them or not.
Are you kidding over all?
The parade finished, the greeter was me.
Can I now draw a dancer ?
!
Come on, shoo!
This circus does not suit me!
Now
When they have to go back?
Where is the money?
The cell storage in the North railway station.
And if you will follow me?
Decide that you went for the money.
Yes...
Or maybe you prefer that I went for a suitcase?
Yes!
Yes, I prefer!
You see, I trust you.
In this and the good of the family are being built.
This is a farewell waltz.
Lovely Gina, the goddess of dance!
Do babes such a success!
Local public immediately legible.
It is a pity that we have to leave tomorrow.
Direction
What do I do in the North Station?
Pick up the suitcase on the receipt, which you stole from me.
Brock!
Thy name!
I pulled a receipt storage.
Receipt, which I hid here under the table!
And that you come back to me!
Look, Bastia,
Your pukalki can not force me to give what I did not take.
Do not give you in the face with it, too, will be able to make not.
A and so will happen, if you would not uber群h.
Do not be offended, I was joking.
Such things.
Yes.
Perhaps it would suit the owner.
Yes, but only if he paid the premiums.
Gina!
Come here.
I pulled it!
Then who?
What are you talking about ?
!
In addition to the receipt, I stole all the money out of a suitcase.
And so - no thieves!
What a fool!
This morning I took out a shirt out of the suitcase.
And the money was there still.
So it happened recently?
What does it change?
All!
If you hurry, you still catch my thief at Gare du Nord!
Do you have money?
I do not.
Maybe you have Marcella?
You carry nonsense.
Perhaps Cinco?
He told me to pay for a few weeks.
You should in any run.
Fernand!
Yes?
If you return the money, we will go to Italy.
If you deceive me, I shall hand you to the police.
You clear favorite?
You are not as good as I thought, Gina.
Okay, go.
If tonight everything goes well,
We will be able to pay taxes, for the light, and we can go tomorrow.
I do not need anything Dario, fortunately.
Madeleine - too.
And so well.
My poor Royal.
In such circumstances, we hold out long.
If Dario number will be successful, we will be able to get out.
This is our last chance.
Cinco!
What do you want?
I have to leave.
Right now, Gina, I can not.
But in the evening, after the presentation, I will try.
Sorry, Cinco.
I would have stayed, but I can not.
The rats are leaving the ship.
Can not find your number 3968.
Perhaps it has already taken.
Yes, but...
You do not know who?
How should I know?
I atonement for service in 8 hours.
And you tell me, as your colleague who works during the day, - where is he?
At home, I guess.
But if you think that he will be able to remember the customer...!
We then give out per day more than one thing, so...
Sorry, sir.
Marcella must leave.
She needed all of her money.
What kind of selfish!
Leave something we can always.
Depends only, under what conditions.
Any day fly off the vultures, hawks...
Hawks?
Bailiffs!
Do you think they will take my horse?
These people take everything.
Straw and logs, stairs and clocks, machinery and horses...
It Attila of our time!
Log in!
What do you want?
Nothing!
I was passing.
Well, Marcella sent you to hell?
This will facilitate the work.
Cinco!
You are sitting on the rocks.
Daughter you hard worker.
You already said that.
So what?
But if there was a guy, a good guy in all respects,
Which will accumulate?
What can you offer him?
Number of Stella and Dario is almost ready.
International Class!
You can repeat it without laughing?
Horse Josiane.
Horse Mademoiselle Josiane!
With or without a rider?
What do you mean?
I mean that is the only guarantee - if I become your kinsfolk.
I want to marry, and you need money.
For the salvation of the circus, my Kvedchi, you need a lot of money.
I have.
And where?
You know, after my accident I embraced you.
I won.
Yes - compensation, disability benefits.
400 thousand!
What do you say to this, father?
Josiane,
A woman was not created to live alone.
I do not marry Kvedchi!
What you are discussing here is disgusting!
Is that you talking with her father so ?
!
Strange you raised it.
If I knew...
Sidi.
Why do you refuse Kvedchi?
As it has charm.
And this charm he gives everything.
No one skirt missed!
Does it good!
Well, nothing can be done, Kvedchi.
I thought you were serious fellow.
Take your money.
Circus, certainly will not,
But my daughter will be happy.
I am happy with the ruined and robbed her father.
In the living corpse!
Television remove him hide,
Bailiffs will get seeds.
We beg, my girl.
But most importantly, I make you happy.
I agree.
I agree, if Kvedchi promise me that...
Oh, yes!
I swear!
Hide grandmother!
Till tomorrow.
How much do I owe you?
Today is...
34 thousand francs.
Wow!
With a small premium.
In life there are ups and downs.
At the moment - soon rise.
In vain you are leaving us on the rise.
Can I still and will be back.
Thank Cinco.
Gina!
So, is it true?
Are you leaving us?
Yes.
Where are you going?
In another place.
Cinco you paid?
I know.
This is Marcella.
Once they slept together.
And she always had a weakness for him.
Marcella?
Can not be!
Goodnight Kvedchi.
Monsieur!
Monsieur!
You call from Provence.
You can pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, yes?
Waiting.
Hello?
It is on the phone.
He got a call from Mersevalya, Marsevalya...
Stay here.
Yes, hello?
Is that you, Gina?
No, no, nothing happened.
I am late.
How is it not scary?
Yes.
And so, you are not thieves!
What?
How to...
Cinco ?
!
A lot of money?
Do you think you can still fix it?
Yes, it is.
Keep.
So will converge.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Here.
Up to 9 hours, you call the number 7 in Marsevale.
And leave this message to Mr. Roland.
Rely on me.
Well, mademoiselle.
Now the flowers?
Yes, flowers.
For Josiane.
What?
I told you that it will be mine.
She is mine.
Well... almost.
I wonder what made her change her mind?
What are these two again come to do here?
Do you know them?
Then be engaged in their business!
What do I do!
It comes back, but no money.
Go.
Nice to hire?
Fernand!
What?
Send it.
Fernand, be kind.
Fredo, you must listen to me!
Of course, Fernand, we are here to do just that.
I do not dare to go for the money.
At the last moment I was afraid that the police monitors the cafe.
You is surely arranged.
As they watched the cafe, they have not followed the North Station.
And I - a victim!
I know.
The only misunderstanding between us - I perceive you as a man.
I wanted to give you a chance.
You look like you could not use it.
You have passed the cops.
It is still possible to settle.
We all forget.
But the favor.
The money we need.
Even if you have to pull out of the bills one by one.
But this - work for Pepe.
I stuck it under the table.
We have a lot of time, Fernand.
Maybe you want to work Pepe?
Everything is ready.
Are you comfortable?
Yes?
Good feeling?
Where is the money?
I would, perhaps, have learned if you trusted me.
What are you risking?
It Again we throw!
I assure you, he can!
Pepe!
Calmly.
You should not tease him.
Where is the money?
Hell, Fred, if I knew, why would I come back?
In order for us to kill you!
I do it?
Turn around.
It blockhead!
You can only help me!
I now know the circus.
Take me back,
And I swear I will settle everything quickly.
What do you think?
I think that you are too diligent.
Forget the circus, I will do everything for you.
Especially not flutter.
I just I will go and have a look and come back immediately.
Admit it, it would be a shame to die so young, with hoarded money?
Recklessly!
How old are you?
Packaging.
And the matches.
No, the big boxes.
Please, sir.
With you 290 francs, monsieur.
Gina!
Gina!
So you did not go?
So you stay with us?
Listen,
I go from Arsha.
!
Listen Cinco, all very serious!
A petrol - is also seriously?
And be careful!
Strongly do not chase!
She left on your wheelbarrow!
Why did you give her?
Dahl gave!
I had time to give her?
Do not you see?
Log in!
Let me introduce myself - Angela Lombardi.
I said, your clicker left?
Maybe I could replace it?
!
I started peddler under the counter on the boulevards.
And then, I have always loved the circus.
Monsieur.
Mademoiselle ready to replace the strikers.
These pretty girls can not come.
But I can offer only 1000 per week.
More I did not ask.
I ran, Kvedchi waiting for me.
Goodbye, Mademoiselle.
Two days of work, and then...
Agreed?
Come later.
I will teach you the science barkers.
Intricacies of the profession.
It is an art!
Thank you!
You can sit down?
Do not worry.
Coffee with cream.
Do you want to eat?
They then very tasty sandwiches.
How rich.
And yet, you know, I thought about our honeymoon.
How?
Well, first, we make love in a gondola...
O Kvedchi!
And then?
Nothing.
You were fast.
Yes.
Now you have to find a guy who suspiciously quickly become rich.
Who is spending right and left.
You know what I mean?
I understand.
I think her dad has already hired.
I tell you that he will dismiss it, and together with Gina!
But Gina had gone.
She left and came back.
Our jeep!
Do you like crabs in the pot?
A string beans...
love?
You are pampered!
Yes, but...
If you want to nibble on, will have to begin to sit at the table.
How funny!
Well,
Figured you about money?
I asked the question!
If Fredo and his woman would find the money,
Them and they run away.
How to drink to!
Fredo left you here to his hands were free.
But... the case is not yet completed.
And we divide them into two.
I had been thinking about it.
Well, Fernand, I here you simply hold oaf!
Cigarettes do not want?
I want.
Here, in the pocket.
Tell me,
Do not be nervous, dear.
Now you know it.
Gina!
Do Cinco never had any money.
And now - there.
According Kvedchi he gave Marcella.
Fortune Teller?
Sis Bastia?
Yes.
But it is certainly not true.
Marcella had nothing to do with it!
You bastard!
So you gave the money to her Sis?
Be polite!
Will be explained with his maid.
I believe her.
Fredo also believe!
You are one against.
You do not leave me here to die alone!
Madam - the neighborhood.
Lucky!
Hey!
Repeat.
I put out the door.
It seems that fear of something.
Every fear, then there is a reason.
I left 2 more ball.
Yes.
Here the fair roaming gunmen.
You they probably know.
Interrogate circus acrobat Dario,
More and Gina, a dancer.
But who are you?
Answer!
Hello?
Hello!
Hello...
!
Will you speak ?
!
Will you say, vile creature ?
!
Hell!
The first right.
From such people - always nothing but trouble!
Dad!
Where is Dad?
Marcella!
Well, it just is not enough...
Okay, I go.
Here is a gift!
It is, for sure, mutila with his brother.
Doctor she is no longer needed.
So, parted, move!
You go out there!
Fast!
This is murder!
She kept the house all your money!
I think it strangled.
She has marks on her neck.
Call to the site, let people send.
Yes, chef!
Expenses on a trailer!
All forbidden to leave the area of the holidays!
This is murder!
Yes.
Only you - not a policeman.
4 dead man in Marseilles, 5 - at Pigalle.
Who is next?
If the case begins with a fight, a fight over it.
We are going to fight, I feel.
Rate - 14 million, and we have something to lose.
So I prefer you to leave the game.
We are all divided into two.
May, will continue?
Years in prison for two is not divided.
When the motley your age gets 10 years - this is the end.
Are you ready for 10 years wearing a gray robe and slippers tinkering?
I do not care.
Do not say that.
As long as you have the conscience of nothing.
Or almost nothing.
And tomorrow everything is going to be different.
Return to Paris and wait quietly.
Calmly wait what?
Exhaust itself?
Ask yourself, have arrested you or not?
Ask myself, what I bring, - oranges or flowers.
Shut up!
For fun you have to pay.
Life - is a journey.
I would like to go first class.
I have always loved silk shirts and shoes made to order.
And I have not traded in a row, it would be illogical.
Discover!
I thought I told you to go back and wait there?
Disaster struck, Fredo.
Chick Fernand came to explore, and I...
I caught it.
She uttered a few words about Marcello.
That she was involved.
More.
You went to Marcelle?
Yes.
To ask her any questions.
It is necessary to pass the buck, Fredo!
Marcella?
Marcella!
I assure you, I have nothing to do with!
In her heart she refused.
You do not leave me?
Where do I, in your opinion, go?
Where do you want.
To the Greeks.
Okay.
Then I will come back to the villa.
I left them there either.
Then finish them off for a full set.
Will you come, Fredo?
You do not leave me?
I will ask the President himself, so he put us together for the company.
Why did he kill her?
Misunderstanding, as it said Fernand.
Protracted misunderstanding.
Pepe was too stupid, Fernand - too cunning.
Police will be here soon.
I?
You go back to Paris.
If all goes well.
No.
They you more useful.
This is unlikely.
The car, for sure, in the search.
What are you going to do?
Either way, if I do not go down after 5 minutes they will rise.
Next!
Stop!
What?
Turns?
I sang this number 3 years ago Karpatto.
Pepe - a professional, and I have lost the knack.
My poor!
What are you naplela about my sister?
In general, I would have passed anyone but you.
Git!
Stagnant blood.
It will pass.
How did you get here?
I follow you on a jeep owner.
Keep.
Popey.
Come on.
Bastia foul!
Bastia was blown away!
They still know enough!
Come on.
In minutes as the score goes!
No.
Do not for a minute.
It can wait.
Oh, you... you bastard!
Yes, it can wait!
He accused me of stealing receipts from storage.
He even guided me the gun.
Bring it in a report.
Nothing.
He saw that I was not to blame, and calmed down.
Okay, good.
We have already moved.
The owner of the circus - are you?
Go.
You can be free.
But do not leave your trailer.
You must have a fortune of money?
So what?
If I had to kill all those who I have money,
You would have to double the staff.
Well that ended this market?
I think they are looking for a suitcase.
Will conduct searches.
Let there be sought!
The one who searches will find!
The search...
The search...
The search...
Stay here.
Hey, there!
Where are you?
Someone looking for?
Get down.
No, I...
I have come to my sister.
Well, okay, I go to next time.
Show me the documents!
The one who searches will find...
And find what?
Kvedchi!
Those guys!
Those guys will not find!
Those guys!
Hey, Kvedchi, open the door!
What are you doing, Kvedchi?
Tell me!
You open it or not ?
!
Are you crazy?
Why do you close?
Carriages will be searched.
It is mine!
Money!
Do not touch the money!
They curse!
Yes, leave the money!
They curse!
Gimme!
Give it to me!
Thanks to you, give here!
I tell you, it will be searched!
If they find us...
Exploded gas cylinder?
Faster!
Do not approach!
Get away!
Here it is dangerous!
Save yourself!
Caution!
Caution, Fernand!

Boris!
Do you hear?
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
The most talented ones will be exempted.
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
Wait!
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.

See you tomorrow.
Give me the blanket.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
I won.
All right.
Why not?
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
Listen...
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
Not even the war.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
Hi!
Tell me.
Make it short, will you?
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
For you?
We both volunteered...
When?
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
Do you hear?
a hundred years.
Go on now.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
He was furious.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
What are you putting in there?
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
And help her.
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
Quiet now, Grandma.
Come over here.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
Her fiance is going away.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
Well, are we all here?
At last!
Is Boris home?
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
I feel left out...
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Mark, stay with Dad.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
Drink it.
Where?
What is it?
For your birthday.
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
Where were you?
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
Oh, this damn war!
Have you decided about a job?
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
Get your things.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
The filthy murderers!
Oh, he must have written.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
Get down here!
Come back!
Are you crazy?
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I promised Boris.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
For you.
Veronica!
Come on.
Come with me.
I love you.
No.
No!
No!
No!
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Sachkov!
In the incubator.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, let me try that thing.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
We...
Oh, I forgot.
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Can you hear me?
I want to rest for a while.
Hold on to me.
Now hang on, hold tight.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
How are you?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
There she is!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Of course not.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
You have your whole life before you.
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
The meaning of life?
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Your place is nice and cozy.
Bundle up.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
The war!
Yes, this war.
What do I owe you?
Mark, can you do me a favor?
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nurse!
Thanks.
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
Good riddance!
Right.
What a petty soul!
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
Daydreaming, you fool!
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
Now, now, be quiet.
Stop rattling.
Here, play with the cover.
Oh, my God.
Keep him quiet!
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
My squirrel to a boy?
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
Arrange for a ride now.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I love you!
Look, a note!
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
I must go.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
Why?
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Going home?
Not yet.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
What do you want me to play?
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
He was really in love with her.
Thanks very much.
I will.
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
Anything could happen.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Boris is alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!

Thursday, on the embankment.
Squirrel!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
Squirrel!
A harmless mental disturbance.
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
Outrageous!
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
Boris!
Do you hear?
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
The most talented ones will be exempted.
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
Wait!
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
Save your sketches.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Take care.
See you tomorrow.
Give me the blanket.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
I won.
All right.
Why not?
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
Listen...
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
Not even the war.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
Hi!
Tell me.
Make it short, will you?
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
For you?
We both volunteered...
When?
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
Do you hear?
a hundred years.
Go on now.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
He was furious.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
What are you putting in there?
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
And help her.
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
Quiet now, Grandma.
Come over here.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
Her fiance is going away.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
Well, are we all here?
At last!
Is Boris home?
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
I feel left out...
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Mark, stay with Dad.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
Drink it.
Where?
What is it?
For your birthday.
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
Where were you?
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
Oh, this damn war!
Have you decided about a job?
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
Get your things.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
The filthy murderers!
Oh, he must have written.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
Get down here!
Come back!
Are you crazy?
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I promised Boris.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
For you.
Veronica!
Come on.
Come with me.
I love you.
No.
No!
No!
No!
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Sachkov!
In the incubator.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, let me try that thing.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
We...
Oh, I forgot.
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Can you hear me?
I want to rest for a while.
Hold on to me.
Now hang on, hold tight.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
How are you?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
There she is!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Of course not.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
You have your whole life before you.
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
The meaning of life?
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Your place is nice and cozy.
Bundle up.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
The war!
Yes, this war.
What do I owe you?
Mark, can you do me a favor?
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nurse!
Thanks.
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
Good riddance!
Right.
What a petty soul!
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
Daydreaming, you fool!
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
Now, now, be quiet.
Stop rattling.
Here, play with the cover.
Oh, my God.
Keep him quiet!
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.

I love you!

Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Your place is nice and cozy.
Bundle up.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
The war!
Yes, this war.
What do I owe you?
Mark, can you do me a favor?
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nurse!
Thanks.
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.?
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
Good riddance!
Right.
What a petty soul!
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
Daydreaming, you fool!
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
Now, now, be quiet.
Stop rattling.
Here, play with the cover.
Oh, my God.
Keep him quiet!
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
My squirrel to a boy?
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
Arrange for a ride now.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I love you!
Look, a note!
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
I must go.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
Why?
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Going home?
Not yet.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
What do you want me to play?
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
He was really in love with her.
Thanks very much.
I will.
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
Anything could happen.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Boris is alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well....
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Squirrel!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
Squirrel!
A harmless mental disturbance.
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
Outrageous!
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
Boris!
Do you hear?
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
The most talented ones will be exempted.
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
Wait!
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
Save your sketches.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Take care.
See you tomorrow.
Give me the blanket.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
I won.
All right.
Why not?
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
Listen...
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
Not even the war.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
Hi!
Tell me.
Make it short, will you?
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
For you?
We both volunteered...
When?
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
Do you hear?
a hundred years.
Go on now.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
He was furious.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
What are you putting in there?
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
And help her.
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
Quiet now, Grandma.
Come over here.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
Her fiance is going away.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
Well, are we all here?
At last!
Is Boris home?
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
I feel left out...
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Mark, stay with Dad.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
Drink it.
Where?
What is it?
For your birthday.
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
Where were you?
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
Oh, this damn war!
Have you decided about a job?
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
Get your things.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
The filthy murderers!
Oh, he must have written.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
Get down here!
Come back!
Are you crazy?
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I promised Boris.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
For you.
Veronica!
Come on.
Come with me.
I love you.
No.
No!
No!
No!
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Sachkov!
In the incubator.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, let me try that thing.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
We...
Oh, I forgot.
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Can you hear me?
I want to rest for a while.
Hold on to me.
Now hang on, hold tight.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
How are you?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
There she is!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Of course not.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
You have your whole life before you.
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
The meaning of life?
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Your place is nice and cozy.
Bundle up.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
The war!
Yes, this war.
What do I owe you?
Mark, can you do me a favor?
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!

Nurse!
Nurse!
Thanks.
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
Good riddance!
Right.
What a petty soul!
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
Daydreaming, you fool!
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
Now, now, be quiet.
Stop rattling.
Here, play with the cover.
Oh, my God.

Musician!
Are you deaf?
Can you hear me?
I want to rest for a while.
Hold on to me.
Now hang on, hold tight.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
How are you?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
There she is!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Of course not.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
You have your whole life before you.
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
The meaning of life?
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Your place is nice and cozy.
Bundle up.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
The war!
Yes, this war.
What do I owe you?
Mark, can you do me a favor?
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nurse!
Thanks.
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
Try to see what you can do, nurse?
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
Good riddance!
Right.
What a petty soul!
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
Daydreaming, you fool!
Here you are.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
Now, now, be quiet.
Stop rattling.
Here, play with the cover.
Oh, my God.
Keep him quiet!
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
My squirrel to a boy?
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
Arrange for a ride now.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I love you!
Look, a note!
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
I must go.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
Why?
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
Feodor?
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Going home?
Not yet.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
What do you want me to play?
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
He was really in love with her.
Thanks very much.
I will.
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
Anything could happen.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Boris is alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
Look, look!
There you go.

Well, okay.

Squirrel!
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
Okay.
Squirrel!
And he about her.
a harmless mental illness.
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
Did you tear it?
Disgraceful!
He works a lot.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
Drafted?
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
You understand?
Wait!
Watch out!
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
So you should stay.
Take care of your drawings.
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Nothing yet.
Are you going home?
Well, say hello to her!
What?
Why should I rush it?
See you tomorrow.
Let go.
Give it to me!
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
So?
Too bad.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Who am I?
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
You know, I like this blackout.
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
I went straight to your place.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
Squirrel.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
All right.
Boris!
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
Where are Irina and Mark?
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
That sounds suspicious.
From the medicine cabinet.
Drink it yourself.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
And I thought the bride had arrived.
Sorry.
This one.
What you want to say is:
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Stay with Father.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
Where did he go?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
Where were you?
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
Grandma?
Nothing?
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
Go get your things.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
For you.
Only for your sake.
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
Sachkov!
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Borozdin!
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
Hold on to me.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
Leave me here.
Shut up.
Hold on, hold on.
So, are you alive?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
Are you wounded?
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 3 26 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
Unload!
Siberia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
From whom?
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
The mail.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
...45, 46, 47...
For you.
Lededeva?
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
Was?
Of course not.
My dear, what are you saying?
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
Yes... the war.
How much do I owe you?
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
I hope so.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
Here comes another batch!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
Thank you.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
He got word from home this morning.
She married someone else, the bitch.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
Stop it this minute!
Are you trying to get discharged?
He got a letter.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
Boris.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
Interesting, but unintelligible.
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
Go there yourself!
Quiet, quiet.
Stop that noise!
Here, play with this cap!
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
Where did he go?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
Just to spite me!
I have a husband.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I love you.
Sorry.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
On this day you came into this world.
But what can we do?
This is war.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
Going home?
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
Thank you.
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
A lot of things could have happened.
Boris is alive.
Boris!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!

From the medicine cabinet.
Drink it yourself.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
And I thought the bride had arrived.
Sorry.
This one.
What you want to say is:
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Stay with Father.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
Where did he go?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
Where were you?
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
Grandma?
Nothing?
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
Go get your things.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
For you.
Only for your sake.
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
Sachkov!
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Borozdin!
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
Hold on to me.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
Leave me here.
Shut up.
Hold on, hold on.
So, are you alive?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
Are you wounded?
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 3 26 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
Unload!
Siberia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
From whom?
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
The mail.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
...45, 46, 47...
For you.
Lededeva?
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
Was?
Of course not.
My dear, what are you saying?
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
Yes... the war.
How much do I owe you?
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
I hope so.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
Here comes another batch!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
Thank you.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
He got word from home this morning.
She married someone else, the bitch.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
Stop it this minute!
Are you trying to get discharged?
He got a letter.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
Boris.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
Interesting, but unintelligible.
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
Go there yourself!
Quiet, quiet.
Stop that noise!
Here, play with this cap!
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
Where did he go?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
Just to spite me!
I have a husband.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I love you.
Sorry.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
On this day you came into this world.
But what can we do?
This is war.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
Going home?
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
Thank you.
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
A lot of things could have happened.
Boris is alive.
Boris!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
Look, look!
There you go.

Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
Squirrel!
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
Okay.
Squirrel!
And he about her.
A harmless mental illness.
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
Did you tear it?
Disgraceful!
He works a lot.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
Drafted?
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
You understand?
Wait!
Watch out!
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
So you should stay.
Take care of your drawings.
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Nothing yet.
Are you going home?
Well, say hello to her!
What?
Why should I rush it?
See you tomorrow.
Let go.
Give it to me!
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
So?
Too bad.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Who am I?
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
You know, I like this blackout.
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
I went straight to your place.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
Squirrel.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
All right.
Boris!
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
Where are Irina and Mark?
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
That sounds suspicious.
From the medicine cabinet.
Drink it yourself.

Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
The most talented ones will be exempted.
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
Wait!
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
Save your sketches.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Take care.
See you tomorrow.
Give me the blanket.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
I won.
All right.
Why not?
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
Listen...
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
Not even the war.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
Hi!
Tell me.
Make it short, will you?
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
For you?
We both volunteered...
When?
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
Do you hear?
a hundred years.
Go on now.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
He was furious.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
What are you putting in there?
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
And help her.
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
Quiet now, Grandma.
Come over here.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
Her fiance is going away.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
Well, are we all here?
At last!
Is Boris home?
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
I feel left out...
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Mark, stay with Dad.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
Drink it.
Where?
What is it?
For your birthday.
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
Where were you?
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
Oh, this damn war!
Have you decided about a job?
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
Get your things.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
The filthy murderers!
Oh, he must have written.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
Get down here!
Come back!
Are you crazy?
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I promised Boris.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
For you.
Veronica!
Come on.
Come with me.
I love you.
No.
No!
No!
No!
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Sachkov!
In the incubator.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, let me try that thing.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
We...
Oh, I forgot.
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Can you hear me?
I want to rest for a while.
Hold on to me.
Now hang on, hold tight.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
How are you?
Hey, buddy!
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
There she is!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Of course not.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
You have your whole life before you.
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
The meaning of life?
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Your place is nice and cozy.
Bundle up.
I admire your wife.
She must be very happy with you.
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
The war!
Yes, this war.
What do I owe you?
Mark, can you do me a favor?
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
Nurse!
Thanks.
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
Good riddance!
Right.
What a petty soul!
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
Daydreaming, you fool!
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
Now, now, be quiet.
Stop rattling.
Here, play with the cover.
Oh, my God.
Keep him quiet!
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
My squirrel to a boy?
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
Arrange for a ride now.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I love you!
Look, a note!
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
I must go.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
Why?
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Going home?
Not yet.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
What do you want me to play?
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
He was really in love with her.
Thanks very much.
I will.
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
Anything could happen.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Boris is alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...

Boris!
Do you hear?
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
The most talented ones will be exempted.
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?

Listen...
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
Not even the war.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
Hi!

Bring that thing from the medicine chest.

Boris is alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Oh, mighty God
Please take my soul, to ask You why You torture me
Take my soul or alleviate the suffering
Oh, God, are You...
I ask Your forgiveness
I know You exist, my heart shivers hearing Your name
But I wonder, and You are the Most Merciful and Righteous
Why are we led to temptation?
Why does sin take over virtue?
Why does the evil in our souls overcome the goodness?
Why does one sin then remorse and ask for forgiveness?
I have committed many sins but I am confused;
was it my deprivation from my mother that pushed me towards evil?
My parents were divorced when I was two
And my father was responsible for bringing me up
He was my father, brother and mother as well
He granted me his youth, he lived only to please me
Nevertheless, nothing compensated for the loss of my mother
I envied any girl that had a mother
These things were like a barrier between me and my dad when I started to turn into a young woman
It made me feel lonely and deprived
My father was the only thing I really possessed
I considered myself responsible for his happiness
We lived with my uncle who was only a few years older than I was
I was the lady of the house
My face had no sinister look to it
I started my evil deeds by pulling small pranks that later developed into big disasters
Even my schoolmates were not exempted from them
Kawthar was in love with my cousin, Medhat
I convinced her falsely that Medhat loves me
I was able to part between them and ruin their lives just because I liked being evil but I would cry also
I cried for long nights, in regret for what I had done
And I was forever sleepless
SLEEPLESS
Based on a novel by:
Ehsan Apdel Koddous
Directed by:
Salah Apu Seif
Then came the day when I felt my life was really falling apart
I was sixteen, attending boarding school
My father came and took permission from the principal to take me home
You know something, Nadia
Why?
You know I sent you there because I had to
Nanny Halima is like a mother to me
I have worried about you all my life
Only a woman could talk to you about those issues
I never complained
Yes, but we have to live together forever
You know, when you get married,
I will make sure that your husband will take us both
We can never live together though unless I married
I have lived without marriage for 14 years, for your sake
And now I married for your sake too
The only condition in the woman I was going to marry was that she would take care of you, and I found her
If you love her, Nadia, I will love her
I only want you to be happy, Daddy
Hello, Nadia
Aunt Safiya
Planning to get drunk, Aziz?
This is your third drink
What to do?
How posh!
Bless your hands, Safy
What have you done to yourself?
What is this hairstyle?
You look just like Aunt Safiya now
I am not as cute as Nadia
Nadia is beautiful, have a seat
Sit over there, Nadia, in the seat across me
Come on, darling
Well, get yourself a bride
You are always at night clubs!
When I was young, I wanted to marry Daddy
No man in this whole world is worthy of Nadia
Not even Daddy?
Your father is one of a kind
But I hope you find a man like him
Oh, God!
I have a long night yet, tonight is the big night
Do you hear that?
All his nights are like that
Actually, I asked the cook to make Messakaa because I learned that Nadia likes it
Oh, now you are reminding me of the 100 pounds I owe you!
Let him go, he probably has a date;
You are not a niece, you are a wicked mother-in-law!
Stop drinking, would you?
Good night
Will you sleep this early?
Good night, darling
As long as you are by my side, I feel on fire
This is not how to do it..
Not yet, sir
Put this vase on the cupboard over there
I hope you get married soon
Your father, Lady Safiya and your uncle are waiting for you
Everything has changed since Lady Safiya came
I feel that everything in the house is newer and prettier
The furniture is still the same, it was just too close together
I never thought I would ever wake up this early
Early?
We should take Nadia to the doctor
Vitamins?
No, all she needs is a husband
Husband?
Who could we fool into marrying her?
Remember when I asked you to make me scrambled eggs
You burned your hand, and nearly burned the house down!
We all did that as kids
Why do you want to marry me off?
Bored of me?
Safiya?
No one is answering
You answer it
Hello, how are you, Auntie?
Thursday?
What time?
Seven?
Bye-bye, Auntie
You know what, Daddy?
Why?
I was once at her place, she left me alone and talked to her boyfriend on the phone
She was talking to him while her mother was sitting next to us
Be fair!
She was talking to him, pretending he was a girl
Who wants to come to the club for some fun?
I am very sorry, miss
I apologies again, a hundred times
And you are straight?
Where were you just now?
Playing backgammon
So, was your opponent a brunette or a blonde?
Watch it, Ahmed
Yes, who is this?
I am sure you would enjoy talking to me
No one prodded me to call you, no
I happen to like you
This is selfishness!
You can imagine me as we speak
But I will always be asking myself: who is she?
Is she pretty or ugly?
Who told her to call me?
Later, when I feel comfortable about you
Who told you I needed more women?
Did I beg you to call me and test me - to see if I am worthy of you or not?
Wait a minute
This phone thing is old-fashioned
Times have changed
There are now clubs and social gatherings for people to meet and know each other
People have no time for such hypocrisy
Did you expect me to jump at you and say I loved you?
I will count till three
My father is Ahmed Lotfy, we live in Dokki
You saw me and you liked me
You even threw your ball at me this morning
Great!
When will we meet?
Please, Nadia
Since we will meet anyway, then the sooner, the better
Tomorrow at 4:30 in front of the Horse-Riding Club
No, 4:30
I am confused, almost lost
As if an invisible hand pushed me towards an unknown fate
I needed someone by my side
I needed someone to guide me to the path of security
But I had no one
I felt just as lonely as I had before
I feel afraid of Mostafa
He is stronger and older than I am, and more experienced
Should I turn back?
I think I should
I am not young, I am 18
I wish!
I am 36
Double your age
So?
So, if I am 36,
I should be dating two 18-year-olds!
I was afraid someone would see me getting in your car
Tell me more about yourself
You tell first, I have heard horror stories of you!
Listen up now
See, as I was saying...
What do they want from us?
They have done nothing wrong
The street is just as much theirs as it is ours
They saw a nice girl, they can look as they please
How are your mom and sisters?
Great.
Were you really thinking of me?
I will make you dresses that will make men fly after you
You want to get rid of me?
All girls want to get rid of their families and marry
On his way. go change for supper
Are you home?
Are you angry with me?
I waved at you when I got out of your car - you left as if you were thinking: good riddance!
Why not?
At the Aquarium Park?
But Mostafa...
I promise you.
I was supposed to meet him at five
But I found myself out of the house at eleven to look up his place
It was a huge building, I passed it hesitantly
I felt everyone was watching me
As if they knew I would be back at five to meet Mostafa in his apartment
Then I went to the back of the building as if I were studying the scene of the would-be crime
I was afraid that someone would see me
But the building had offices for lawyers and doctors, companies and a dressmaker
Would you like to take a look around?
I was looking for a picture of a girl that looked like you
Would you like to listen to music?
Am I just another page in a diary?
Ask me this question after two weeks
By then I will know how you stand compared to them
There is one obvious thing I can tell you now
I never admired younger men
You like older men?
You are the first man I have ever known
There is a twenty-year difference between us
When you are 38, I will be 56
You will be great at 56
Not any more
When I first walked in, I almost died of fear
I was afraid you put something to drug me in the chocolate
Mostafa kept his promise
I walked out, untouched
I went for a second time, and a third
But he was always conservative, frigid
I enjoyed his amusing conversations about his life, his books, his experiences
I also talked to him, about everything in my life
He knew what was going on at home
I feel sorry for Aunt Safiya
Why did he marry her then?
For my sake, to take care of me
But why her?
He could have married someone he loved
Not too fat or too ugly
She can barely read or write though
You have to make him love her
If he married her for your sake, you can make him love her
I was happy with the new life that Mostafa opened before my very eyes
There was something I was waiting to happen
I was waiting for him to kiss me
Every love story begins with a kiss
So where was my kiss?
Maybe there was another woman in his life
I wonder who else you are seeing?
No one, these days
A bachelor like you with no woman in his life?
A man in my age can go without a woman forever
You are 36, my dad remarried at the age of 39
He found a woman worth marrying
Not yet
What is this?
Whose earring is it?
I wonder who broke it?
Not me, it was broken when I found it
I love this record
Have you excused me from the promise?
What promise?
Remember the promise I made before your first visit?
Your earring, Nadia
I sent Nanny to hurry her up
What do you think of Dr. Helmy, my cousin?
A good lad, I have no objection to him
She wants to get rid of me to take over the house
She is very kind and she loves you
Love or no love, I am not meeting anyone!
They are guests, and very nice people
What shall we say to them?
Get dressed if you love me at all
Okay
But tomorrow, I will surprise you
No, thanks
You were always talkative, Helmy, why are you quiet now?
You have annoyed her, talk about something else
What do you say if you came over for supper tomorrow?
I have no problem, what about you, Nadia?
Why?
The chauffeur will pick you up after the party
Please, Dad
Okay
Wait a minute, Nadia
This is very suitable
The party is full of kids anyway
Go see why the elevator has stopped
Have I done anything wrong?
No, life did you wrong
Maybe they will ask about me
So the only solution is to keep their phone busy all the time
Nanny Halima hung up
Do you know what I really want?
To walk with you in the street, in front of everyone
To tell everyone that your beauty is mine
Your eyes are mine
Your lips are mine
Turn around
I need that dress tonight, Teresa
We are going out tonight, thank you
Your dress turned out marvelous, you will be a star
Where?
I want to tell you something
What is it?
Tell me, dear
I am in love
What?
In love, with a guy
You mean someone will come and propose?
Why are you so shy about it?
Consider yourself married, congratulations
No one is coming to propose
Apdou!
Those servants are a nuisance!
She refused to share my misery
Mostafa is all I need
But does he really love me?
Will he marry me?
He runs away from any responsibility
the sun is to your right and the moon to your left
My niece, Mrs. Lotfy
And our sweet little Nadia
And Mr. Mostafa El Sherif, you have all heard of him
We see each other at the club
But we have never met before tonight
Please
Are you related to Khalil El Sherif who was - in the Higher Institute of Commerce?
We are old friends and schoolmates
Where is he now?
Nadia!
Hello!
I miss you so much
Guess who I saw yesterday
Damn these people!
Why do they make such a fuss?
When will she stop her nonsense?
Safiya is laughing more than she usually does
What has he told her?
Excuse me
You have very bold opinions
No, not too bold
Everyone is doing wrong and if someone is right they call him bold, crazy or a criminal
Which opinion was he discussing with her?
I know his conversation is intoxicating
Was he trying to impress her?
I saw a marvelous statue depicting this idea in a museum in Rome
I must take part in their conversation
I must say something
I can tell them about the sculptor that killed himself
Mostafa is the one that told me that story
But I must prove myself
I always listen to that program
Have you heard of the intellectual butcher Apu Nekaya?
All the women are admiring your dress tonight, Safiya
They are asking me about your dressmaker
I made this dress myself
It is really classy.
I think...
Mrs. Shushu is really strange
I felt like a stranger
People at parties should mingle
You promised me a dance, Nadia.. if I may, Uncle
May I have this dance, Mrs. Safiya?
Two ice-creams, right?
The smoke inside is suffocating
We are late, we should be leaving anyway
Excuse me
They say Mostafa is a good farmer
His feddan yielded 7 kantars of cotton last year
Am I that cocky?
If you want people to stop calling you cocky, get married
Safiya, you are the last one I will go to for advice
Why did Safiya allow him to dance with her like that?
There must be something between them
Maybe they agreed to talk on the phone
Or maybe even...
They will do like he did with me
I am very sorry to be late, Nadia
Looks like you enjoyed it the most
Because you were so pretty
You gave me a very bad impression of her
She seems nice and pretty, your dad must love her madly
Why did you dance with her like you did?
She was dancing with respect
She is very respectable, everyone who sees her will respect her
Are you mad?
What will you have?
Yesterday Safiya drank juice
She must be highly educated and self-confident
Two cups of raspberry juice
Nadia!
Nadia!
What day is today, Ahmed?
May 3
You have made me the happiest man on earth
I hope our happiness lasts forever
We will all take our tea in the garden
What about Aziz?
Looks like he drank too much in the party
I will go on a small errand and come pack
Bye-bye
Is something wrong?
Are you ill?
I just wanted to spend some time with you
30 blacksmiths with 60 hammers are banging in my head!
Your aunt had bad whiskey
Drink up
Yuck!
This tastes like cod-liver oil!
Are you here, Nadia?
Where did you come from?
Come help me drag this man out of bed
Pull his other leg
No, not my leg!
I think I will sit like this for another week
This afternoon, you must come down
Today is our anniversary
Hope both of you are married soon too
Me?
God forbid!
I am going downstairs, if you want me, call
I fear you will catch cold
You have an excuse for not getting a gift
There is something prettier
Wow!
It matches the earrings perfectly
I knew you would call your jeweler to pick a gift
So I called him and got my gift in bed!
Thanks, I hope I return it in your marriage soon
I am worried about Nadia these days
I am a bit exhausted
You should see a doctor
Doctor Kenawy will pass by, let him check on her
I am not used to sleeping early and eating good food
Thanks to Aunt Safiya
Yes, she spoiled me
Dear Mother,
I kiss you a thousand kisses
I fear I will wet you with my tears
I cry so much that I can no longer sleep
Imagine that I live among cheaters, in silence
The cheater is Aunt Safiya
She is cheating on Dad and with whom?
My uncle!
She was kissing him and he was...
And my uncle, who never stayed home no longer stays out or eats out like before
He even pretends to be sick to stay home
She goes up to his flat till gullible Dad comes home
And with whom?
My uncle!
She was kissing him and he was...
Nadia!
Nadia!
Dad!
Why are you up till now?
I wrote a letter to Mom then tore it up
Nothing, just a bit tired
Shall I make you a cup of tea?
Shall I wake up aunt Safiya?
You are back early
What are you saying?
What is wrong?
Leave me alone, stay away
Have you been drinking?
I am not drunk or staggering, am I?
Eat your breakfast before it goes cold
I have no appetite
No one wants to eat
Maybe he has problems with his estate
God be with him, and with you too, dear
You must see a doctor, you are so pale
Good morning, Dad, why are you back so early?
Or maybe she went upstairs
Ahmed, why are you back so early?
Where is Aziz?
What do you see?
I never depend on them
I am sick and left my room for your sakes
I already ate
She told you already?
What else does she do besides wake me up and feed me?
Safiya has turned the house into an army camp!
I wanted to show you our account at the Credit Bank
You are up to it, leave the credit to me and the banks to you
Of course I am up to it, I handle the farm affairs, bank accounts, taxes
And I marry a woman to wake you up every morning
You married me to wake your brother up?
All will be well in the end
Is there anything you want me to do, Ahmed?
You never did anything
You wanted it this way
Shall we go or should I apologize right now?
Why not go?
Is anything wrong?
Whatever you like, Nadia.
Aziz, are you coming or not?
Are you inviting me or pushing me away?
You never liked these gatherings but all of a sudden you love them
Safiya made me like a lot of things even the silly things
Come in
Did you sleep well last night?
You know something?
I feel that we have drifted away from each other
Remember when we lived alone?
Those were the days
All we had was each other
I will never want anyone but you, Daddy
Wash up and eat your breakfast
You must eat well, you look weak and I am worried
We will go to the farm, take care of yourself
Uncle Aziz
What is it?
Imagine that Dad and Aunt Safiya went to the farm?
Really?
I am worried too.
Can I ask a favor of you?
We are the only two people Dad has in this world
What if we went to the farm?
He seems upset, we must be there for him
Who knows what he is thinking of, or what he intends to do
Forget it, you go alone
Would you like me to take a cab to the farm?
Get up, please
Hello
What brings you here?
I came to see if you were okay
How kind of you!
Uncle Aziz is very worried about you
Aunt Safiya said you were ill
She said I was ill?
What joy!
You came?
Welcome
God be with you
What is it?
He is acting strangely these days
We just got here!
I am taking my wife and daughter with me
I want to stay where we can talk
Here you are, sir, juice for Miss Nadia
What happened to this house?
Are you awake, Uncle?
Awake and dressed since early morning waiting for you all to leave, so as not to see any of you!
A husband and wife hate each other, what is it to us?
Pity!
Is she downstairs?
Both of them went out, each on his own
I am going to the club, want to come along?
I wish, but a friend of mine is coming over
Can I ask you to do me a favor?
Yes?
Before you go to the club, go to the dressmaker
Ask her to send me the blue dress
I called the phone company, they said her phone is down
What will people say?
Your favors are all really silly
Get out of here!
What is wrong, Nadia?
Is anything wrong?
Has something happened to your father?
Take your clothes and go back where you came from!
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
Are you crazy?
I divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee
I was crazy the day I married you, I was fooled by you and your family
Now I know I gave my name to someone unworthy of it
You are divorced, get the hell out!
I will not answer you, but be sure that if I walk out,
I will never come pack again
She is innocent, Dad
She is a dishonest woman, you know that very well
She is dishonest, she is a cheater!
Get out!
Out!
Aunt Safiya!
Aunt Safiya!
Aunt Safiya!
She has a nervous breakdown, she is very weak
Rest is very crucial, as I said
and a shot a day, and three of these pills daily after meals
and this medicine is to be taken only at night
Uncle Aziz, Uncle Aziz
Better!
They say he broke the door and found them together!
He is a bastard!
He deserves to be burnt alive!
His sister-in-law?
He was going to shoot her but his daughter stopped him
Poor Nadia!
Master Aziz?
How do you do?
Miss Nadia, she is well
God, have mercy!
Nothing is worth all this grief, Nadia
And just to prove you are wrong, your uncle has told everyone he will marry her
Is this your final answer?
Do you need time to consider?
I have thought a lot about this and I thank you for your noble offer but you know what your brother said about us if we do get married now, everyone will believe him even those who were convinced of our innocence
and they will believe every single word
I never had a brother, Aziz and I always considered you my brother, as you know
Excuse me
The phone never stops ringing, and when I pick up the phone, no one answers
You go rest, and plug in the phone
Close the door
Where are you, Nadia?
Where have you been all this time?
I know you were sick, I called you fifty times
Thank you, Mostafa
Every time the phone rang and no one would answer, I would know it was you
Yes, I am better now
He goes to bars?
Unbelievable!
And how have you been, Mostafa?
I miss you a lot
And what is this story I hear?
The divorce?
Your dad, your uncle and Safiya
The story that people are talking about
No specific reason.
I swear by your life
I knew Safiya could never do such a thing
What did the doctor tell you?
You need a change, take a vacation somewhere
Me?
No, I have to stay here, I have work
But you must call me everyday
Okay, Mostafa, good-bye
Why does he care about her so much?
What does he care if she was having an affair or not?
Does Mostafa love me?
Or do I love Mostafa?
No, this is not love
Maybe I am just fooling around or maybe I was just..
imitating and defying my stepmother
But could it be that I took revenge on Aunt Safiya out of jealousy over Mostafa?
or maybe over my father?
My father who was all mine and was taken away by another woman
The house is all mine now, I am the mistress here
I am on top now
Father came back to me..
I alone carry his name
He comes home only to me again
I ruined Aunt Safiya but alongside, I ruined everything
Our home, my father even I felt ruined
Oh, God, I fear Your wisdom and I fear Your revenge
Yes, surely God will take revenge on me
I ask for Your forgiveness
I ask that You have mercy on me
Hey!
Watch it!
Nadia Lotfy?
!
How are you?
No one has seen you since school days
I will wait for you under the umbrella
Come
I got married then got divorced
And you?
Did you marry your cousin, Medhat?
Not at all
You made me ditch him then you left him?
You still remember?
Hello
Dad, Kawthar was the prettiest girl at school
OK, then you were the prettiest brunette and I the prettiest blonde
Black and white, then?
How enchanting!
Kawthar says you look young
Kawthar is young since she was your schoolmate
I am not young, Dad!
I am older than Nadia, I am 25
I have nothing planned for tomorrow
I have to go take a dip, excuse me
She looks well-bred
She was always kind and loyal
It shows
I am sure that man is crazy over you
Good luck, darling
Hello
The atmosphere is awesome, so romantic
It seems that you are very romantic
I love romance
Are you from Cairo or Alexandria?
From Cairo
Yes, but life is full of worries
What worries you?
Are you married?
No, I had only one divorce!
Never seen a woman blurt out her real age like that
I may be cheating a little bit
You have gotten along already!
You are very lucky to have such a sweet father, Nadia
He sneaks his way into your heart
Give him a break!
As if you were his mother, looking for a bride for him!
I am the only woman in his life so far
So, do you want to be his mother, daughter, or wife?
Come on
She wants to marry my father but does she love him?
Maybe
Who cares?
All that matters is that Dad will be happy
Maybe I can redeem myself of my crime
I miss you, Mostafa, I was so busy
Dad is okay, thanks
Everyday, parties, outings, and presents
Okay..
Good-bye, Mostafa
No, not yet
Do you know that she likes you?
You really make a charming couple, but this time..
We will have a big celebration the day you get married, dear
May God bless
The master will never find a better wife, God damn the culprits!
We will never hear the end of this, will we?
Still no answer
Did I lose or gain weight during the honeymoon?
Remember, we were going to Europe for our honeymoon?
How much money did I save you?
A good sum
Then get me the car you promised me
We already have two cars here
No, I want my own car
As you wish, my darling
Answer, stop being so rude!
Ever since we came pack from Alex, everyday he calls 2 or 3 times
How rude!
Hello, good morning, Mom!
How are you?
I miss you so much
Ahmed?
Mom says hello
Invite her over for lunch
Why, Mom?
You were okay, yesterday
Good bye, dear
Mom is sick and wants us to visit her
Darling, you know I have to go to the farm with the lawyer to close the deal and sell it
Okay
I drove the loyal wife away from his life and put a cheat in her place
I sold out the innocent woman to buy a criminal instead!
God, has Your revenge started to take effect?
Oh, God, O Mighty Avenger
Please forgive me
What is eating at you?
You have changed, you are not like you used to be
I was very busy these days
Do you still love me, Mostafa?
Sometimes you ask the most awkward questions
Listen up, dear
I knew it!
Knew what?
Sometimes I feel we are so far apart
I have to go
Call me
What is this?
Only 15 pounds?
Your husband is getting very stingy
Have mercy!
He just bought me an expensive car last week
Tell him to give you a little more
Time has passed really quickly
I called her mother and she said she left at ten
I have the power to crush her, to kick her out of the house
But will my Dad take another blow?
Dad asked your mom about you and she said you left at ten
Thanks, Nadia
Where were you till now?
I was worried about you!
I asked her not to tell you
Tell me what?
Really?
Nadia, have them serve lunch, I am starving!
Okay
No, no, no
One step at a time
The doctor story, you made up and perfected in an instant!
Listen here, you know that your dad loves me and that he is happy with me
I am worried about Nadia these days
Why so, Nadia?
You should take care of yourself
How kind you are, dear!
Two ice creams, please
Have you met Nadia?
Kawthar is always raving about your beauty
Is this why you brought me here?
Ice cream?
How innocent!
Dad!
Why are you here?
We finished early so we said we sit here for a while
Kawthar will tell you all about it later
She and Kawthar would choose the right time
Here is definitely not the right time or place
Come on, Nadia
Nice to meet you, bye
Where did you meet him?
Is he related to Hossam Pacha, the cotton merchant in Alex?
I think he said he was his father
They are from a big family but they lost all their money.
What does he do?
I think in an insurance company, right, Nadia?
Yes
I will ask around, and since you love him, Nadia, the only thing I can demand is decency money was never important
Listen, you got me into this mess, so get me out!
Do you understand?
Why not marry Samir?
He is a cute young man, his father was a pacha
Your father is rich and can support you
So that your husband and lover are under the same roof?
Be a sport
I asked about you in the company you work for but as I told you..
come, Nadia
Overdoing what?
Samir proposed and I agreed
He was so embarrassed, and I felt even more embarrassed
So you just wanted to have a boyfriend?
You met him and you had no intention of marriage?
And would I have agreed without asking about him?
All my friends at the club said he is from a good family and his manager says he is..
But we should wait till we make sure, right?
I see no reason to delay things
You have always been hesitant in marriage
Listen to me, Nadia dear
People have proposed to you ever since you were sixteen and every time, you would say no
I will ask Samir that you live here with us
Please, do that, Ahmed
Money is not important, we have enough to go around
What is this nonsense?
You chose him, not me
Leave her for now, we all did that
I thought once that I was an evil person but God sent me more evil person
The plot is now clear
Marrying me would guarantee Samir a luxurious life and at the same time he would be close to Kawthar
Poor Dad!
Samir was going to take his daughter, his wife and his money!
Dear God, is this Your revenge?
Who would get any sleep on a night like this?
Nadia has always been a good, sensible girl
You must love your husband and be faithful to him
See how much I love Kawthar?
I never imagined falling in love like this
You should take her as your role model for her love and loyalty
Listen, this marriage is not happening, understand?
Why not?
Samir is a good guy
Good for you
I hate him and despise him
So what?
I was in love with Medhat when we were in school and I never married him
Love is something, and marriage is another thing
How unethical!
I will not marry him, and come what may!
Do what you want
I have a message for Daddy
I am having lunch with Samir in his apartment
If he likes it, so be it if he objects, he can divorce me
His life and mine
There was no other way
But could I have exposed her?
I would only ruin our lives once again
I covered up for her infidelity to protect my father
So why is God taking revenge on me?
Is covering up a sin a crime that deserves such a punishment?
But was this my only crime?
Oh, God, have mercy on me, save me
Who do I go to?
Who can I consult?
If I had a brother or sister, if only my mother understood me, or if I had a friend
Is Mostafa there?
He moved?
Thank you
Are you sure of the affair between Kawthar and Samir?
I fear it may be a rumor
You have to tell him, Nadia
Admit everything, save yourself and save him
Tell him
Safiya!
I am sure, very sure
Hello, Nadia
What a beautiful surprise!
Please come in, dear
I missed you
How are you all?
How is Nanny Halima and Apdou?
All are well
I was thinking of you, I wanted to call you but you know how things are
What is wrong?
I have come to beg something of you
Yes, dear
Excuse me, Nadia
I suppose you remember Nadia Lotfy
Hello, Miss Nadia
Mostafa, my fiancé
Congratulations
God, this is Your will, Your revenge
Hello
A blessed marriage, God willing
Please
Many happy returns
Peace on you
May I speak to Nadia?
My uncle has always loved me
Okay, hurry because everyone is waiting
I want you for a second, come
I am sorry to keep you
I want your opinion in a legal issue
It is a really serious issue
If someone is caught having an affair with a married woman do you know what sentence he gets?
I have no idea
A short time in prison
But that has got nothing to do with me
End of what?
Do you think that your affair with Kawthar is a secret?
Kawthar?
You still have a chance to escape!
One word from Nadia will send you to hell
This is nonsense
I heard you talking to Kawthar with my own ears
Where was that?
She recorded your sweet voices on the phone
about your little love nest and the red hot nights you spend together
Think quickly
Congratulations, Nadia
Congratulations, Nadia
She is so pretty
I ask God for forgiveness the only God the Almighty
We regret our sins and ask for forgiveness
and salvation from hell
and that God grant the couple good, pious children
Amen
Give me your hand
In the name of God, the Beneficent the Merciful
Say after me
I wed my daughter, Nadia Lotfy, to you according to the teaching of Apu Hanifa and as per the dowry we have agreed to
I accept the marriage
Nadia!
What is it?
What happened?
I will tell you everything
Unfortunately, it is true
What is between Kawthar and Samir?
I have all the proof you need
Who told her uncle?
Probably her, we can still run
I will never leave this place
Even so!
Are you crazy!
It is a criminal offense!
Come with me
Is there any where we can run away from?
We apologies
You wait here
Call Nanny Halima for me
Nadia!
Aunt Safiya is innocent, Dad and my uncle is, too
I was jealous of her, and God took revenge
Call the hospital right away!
Nadia!
Nadia!
Will the burns leave scars?
Unfortunately, her body has been maimed
Nadia, the doctor put me at ease
Did he tell you everything?
Did he tell you I will live...
Be thankful that God saved you
Saved me to torture me
God is the Most Merciful
I deserve no mercy
We can turn a new leaf, Nadia
Oh, God
~ The end of a journey ~
~ No longer burning ~
~ To fill us with sorrow ~
~ Glad are we to lose ~
~ The sting of yesteryear~
~ Glad are we to see ~
~ A springtime reappear~
~ And so we stand ~
~ A new world before us ~
Mighty nice transportation you got here.
You know a guy around here named Cameron
Sure, I know Ben.
He knows this country like the palm of his hand.
How far is his place?
Oh, about 22 miles straight ahead.
Then you take the left fork.
Got himself a new wife.
He stays, uh, pretty close to home these days.
Is she a nice girl?
Pretty as a picture.
City girl.
Kind of a redhead, about, oh- about 5 foot 3?
Say, you must know her.
They got married up in San Francisco, right after Ben got back from Korea.
Excuse me.
Well, that does her.
I have to haul the stuff.
It kind of ups the price a little bit.
What sort of place does he run?
Straight down the road.
Ben, look out!
Stay where you are!
Ben, are you all right?
Did he gore you?
Nah, he just stomped on me a little.
It happens all the time on a ranch.
I got to brand this fella.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I
All right, Ben.
Ooh!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben, come in here right now!
Ben, come right in here!
Here.
Just shut it off!
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!
I told you not to use it.
I told you I had to clean out the water tank.
I bet you will from now on.
Oh, get out of here!
Go on.
Get out!
All right.
All right.
Look, but that stuff dries fast in this climate.
It was right here in a tin can.
You mean that stuff that looked like brown water?
It cost 11 bucks!
Well, how did I know it was calf medicine?
Eleven bucks thrown away.
You bet I did.
Sure, sure!
At a hundred dollars a week.
This is a cattle ranch.
Honey.
Honey, there will be.
Butane is a very explosive gas.
You have.
Wha-What was it?
It was a cake, you big goon.
Or have you forgotten today was your birthday?
I guess I had.
No.
You never think about anything... except those ugly-looking cows, and you never have.
Aw, come on.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Look, what can I do, huh?
You can get the truck unloaded so you can drive me into town.
And throw in some oats and some hay.
Oh, honey, Meg.
I like it.
Where would you be if I-
Finish it.
Serving nine more years in the penitentiary for violation of parole.
Meg, forget it.
You were lonesome, you were out of the army... and you thought it was a good caper to get a girl out of a jam by marrying her.
Well, it was a good caper.
It was no way to start a marriage.
Aw, hey.
Come on.
Meg, come on now.
Forget it.
Look, baby.
Come on.
There was plenty of love with the other guy, I suppose, huh?
He got you in a jam and ran out on you.
Left you alone to face a 10-year rap!
I bet you still love the guy.
Come on.
Say it.
Meg.
One man got me into jail, and another man saved me from going back.
What do you want?
Ben Cameron?
My name is Denning.
How do you do, Mrs. Cameron?
Just, uh, what is it you want, Mr., uh, Denning?
Well, I wanted to go across the border and do some shooting at Lagos de Zapitan.
Just cross the international bridge at Arivaca.
Hire yourself a guide.
No problem at all.
Well, frankly, I was expecting to come back with a little more than the legal limit.
I want you.
Uh-huh.
Well, why me?
The only other route is 50 miles of pure up and down.
They tell me your fee is a hundred dollars a week.
Will you let me handle this?
Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.
Think it over, Mr. Cameron.
Oh, uh, by the way, my wife is driving to town.
How about giving her a lift?
Why, certainly.
Maybe I better wait till this evening, Ben, and let you drive me.
Why wait?
Let me take that.
Good-bye, Mr. Cameron.
Remember, Ben.
This is the way you wanted it.
Yeah.
I missed you, honey.
You were supposed to come back from Los Angeles that morning.
You never did.
I know.
I started, but I just never got there.
I started the night before.
Then I hit a truck on that straightaway going into Bakersfield.
Took me six months before I could even write you a letter.
So I got ahold of a lawyer.
I gave him some dough to work on your parole.
Then I had to get out of town.
I know, honey.
I got the news two weeks late.
I know, honey.
After all, we-we did find each other.
Take me into town, Nardo.
You know how I hate that.
I know, honey.
Let me take that.
Meg.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
I have a lot of thinking to do.
Hello, Mrs. Cameron.
Having a night on the town?
Ben still working?
First room up on your right.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
~ I miss you ~
~ I care ~
~ And if I tried ~
~ My love for you ~
~ You ought to know ~
~ A million or more times ~
~ You went away ~
~ And my heart ~
~ Went with you ~
~ I speak your name ~
~ In my every breath ~~
And this dress-Where?
Peacock Room, Palace Hotel, San Francisco.
We decided to become a team.
Ah, you do remember.
And what a team.
Best in the business.
We only took the people who could afford it.
We only took those who thought they could take us.
Nothing dishonest about that.
Remember that wildcatter in Dallas?
Boy, what a killing.
You bought me a mink coat and a diamond clip.
Yeah.
Oh, those were the days.
I hocked them when we went broke in Paris.
Listen, honey.
Okay?
Right over there.
That section of land next to yours is open now, if you want it.
I came to sell you my place.
Still want to buy it?
Well, I changed my mind.
Just count me out.
And when I got it, I came for you.
How did you get it?
Look, sweetheart.
It was knowing about my deals that got you that jail term.
But this is all wrapped up.
No description, no photograph, no nothing.
Well, Ben or anybody else.
I wanted Ben because I wanted his wife.
Always will be.
Come on.
Drink your drink.
You mean that farmer?
I thought you were walking out on him anyhow.
But why worry about it, honey?
No, but I like him.
What about me?
I guess I love you, Nardo.
I
I guess I was wrong.
The minute I saw your face, it all came back to me.
Okay.
212, huh?
Where is she?
She left a couple of minutes ago.
Well
Right, Ben.
Can I see your registration certificate?
Was I going too fast?
Can I see your registration certificate?
This far from the border?
Nine miles.
We cover back as far as 20 miles.
At 10 miles, we have quite a few spot checks.
Sure.
Right back here.
Do you have the key?
Look, Officer.
I got to get her back home fast.
You have no right to search my car without a warrant.
Now, look, mister.
Now get that key and get it fast.
Here.
He wants me to pull up a little.
Nardo!
Nardo, what have you done?
Meg.
Leave me alone!
I was only trying to stop you, honey.
I thought you killed him- I mean, deliberately.
Come on.
The rocks have busted the gas tank.
Look, Ben.
It happens all the time.
Sheriff, give us a hand here!
Guy... ran over me... twice.
Had a
On
Go on, Harry.
Talk!
Meg!
Meg!
Open the door.
Meg!
Meg, open the door!
And another thing.
You never saw me before in your whole life, okay?
The man you killed has four kids.
That was an accident.
She was there.
Get some decent clothes on.
All she has to do is tell the truth.
I told you to get dressed.
No!
Please let me go!
Let me go, Ben!
I need you.
The lady generates a little heat.
I wondered why you married him.
Now I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Boy- You two really deserve each other.
How much would you say she was worth?
Well, I offered you $200 before, and you turned it down.
That was before you killed Harry Castleton.
A thousand.
That may be all your stinking carcass is worth.
Look.
What about hers?
Well, you would know more about that than I would.
5,000 for the whole deal.
Nah.
Will ya listen?
I believe you would.
You might decide to turn me over on this side of the border.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Ben, I
Shut up.
I picked a tramp, and I know it.
Especially for 10,000 bucks.
I got a feeling I can trust you.
You got three minutes to get dressed, pack some grub and join us.
Change of underwear.
You must have problems.
You and Meg are riding in here.
Look, Mac.
Because when you stop taking orders, I stop moving.
In the trailer.
When the motor starts, turn the lights off.
Here.
You two get some sleep.
I know I can trust you together.
Hay?
If it means what it sounds like, uh, congratulations.
Any chance of him double-crossing us?
No.
He never made a living at it.
He almost made a square out of you, sweetheart.
A slug in my head right now would send 30,000 volts through yours.
Denning-
You might get hurt.
She slides in at the base of the throat, moves straight up into the brain.
Okay.
Or any other time!
If that ever happens again, Denning-
From now on, we walk.
Most of the time, straight up.
You grab a pack.
Get your stuff together.
What if we have to turn back?
I got news for you, Mac.
You get out on the point and watch her splatter.
Better toss over that case too.
You just take care of your end.
You never liked it anyway.
Come on.
Hiya, pop.
Ben Cameron!
Hiya, Ms. Cameron.
Phew.
Well, we could save time if we had a rope.
You wait right here!
Here, here.
Let me do it.
Okay, son.
All right, Denning, you go first.
Hey, pop.
Tie the dude on, will ya?
Okay.
Sure hope this holds.
Do you, uh, got that five dollars handy?
Here.
Denning, you just hold on.
Uh, you just use your feet as much as you can.
Let me down, Cameron!
Wow!
Oh, wow!
Let me down!
Hey!
Maybe you will.
Say, uh, where is that claim of yours?
Right over here.
Come on.
Take care of this, Meg.
There she be!
You got to play it the way the cards fall.
Bury him!
Well, that ought to tie it up, especially with this fingerprint report.
That dress was found in their cabin.
As for Ben, why not?
He sold his place and moved out the night of the murder.
Ben was with me when Harry Castleton was brought in.
So Cameron helps his wife out of a jam.
After her two-timing him with that fancy Dan?
Yeah, it figures, all right.
Go ahead.
You, uh- You a music lover, Denning?
Then we start out again.
All night.
You can carry her pack.
We have all day tomorrow for sleeping.
I can walk right alongside of you night and day, Cameron.
We have to cross the upper end of the Papago Reservation.
We have to make it tonight.
Sounds reasonable.
Just how far are we from the border?
Too far.
I had to do it.
Me too.
We might never have gotten together again.
The first thing they teach you in the Marine Corps is to cover yourself.
You come first.
You make it sound like a virtue... as if it were our Christian duty to kill anyone that gets in our way.
Wait a minute.
You had nothing to do with it.
And it always will be us.
Think of the future.
Think of us together... once we get rid of that husband of yours.
As far as I can see, I never should have.
I meant when we get across the border.
Nardo, get the $10,000.
How close?
Maybe less.
We can make it alone.
This is something we waited for for three years.
Listen.
I want to get away from the rest of it.
Get what you need.
Get gun.
Help!
Help, somebody!
Help!
What are you trying to do to me?
Nice cow.
You pay.
Drop the gun, Denning.
Pick it up.
Give it to me.
Five of those bills you got in your pocket.
We were hunting out on the reservation by mistake.
How close to the border you think we are?
I thought about five miles.
Five miles?
Why do you look at her?
Is that what she told you?
How would she know?
Something terrible.
I thought the first one was an accident.
I do my own killing.
You want a judge to do yours.
Ben, I
She kept your picture.
She was pretty crazy about you.
We can sleep till noon.
You go down there.
Ben?
Ben, I-
Almost did.
I never saw anybody so anxious to get back to the penitentiary.
He wanted to kill you.
Well, we have a lot in common.
I want to kill him.
Yeah?
Maybe.
Besides, I want to be around when Denning dies.
Ben-
Look.
Do you know why?
Not for the money?
No, not- not just for the money.
It hurts.
Go on.
Go and get some sleep.
Too painful!
Honey
Come on.
Can you make it?
Sit down.
Here, let me help.
Let me look at that arm.
How is it?
You gather it.
If he makes a wrong move, shoot him.
I got to have something dry to start it with.
Fat chance.
You got anything that might be dry?
All right, Denning.
Give it to me.
Give me my 10 grand.
9,500.
You must have trained for it.
Here.
Keep your eye on him.
The next batch oughta do it.
No.
Meg, the rifle.
I might hit you.
Just... cock the hammer... and aim like I taught you.
And thank you.
Here, baby.
Come on.
Good girl.
Here.
You lie down.
Come on.
One thing I gotta say for us, we sure got money to burn.
Oh, a fellow I know left it with me.
He was a little hot, so I held it until he cooled off.
Oh, he knew me very well.
He was my best friend.
All right, baby, come on.
Turn over, huh?
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, baby.
Raise up a little.
All right, baby, this is gonna be hot now.
Easy.
Easy, honey.
Easy.
Now, baby, this is gonna hurt.
Now, you just yell as much as you want, huh?
I know.
I know, baby.
Easy.
There.
Easy.
Now, easy.
Now the dead flesh is cut away, the pain goes awfully fast.
Thank you.
What are you so nervous about?
How do you feel, huh?
If
I
But-You-You loved that scraggly old piece of desert.
Nah, I was getting a bellyful of it.
Besides, I figured it was either you or the ranch... and I
We gotta have money to stay clear.
Not that kind, Ben.
What-What can you do with it, except run for the rest of your life?
Me, honey?
Buy you some new shoes.
Pardon me.
Maybe I should have knocked.
A little more than I can afford.
Besides, the storm is clearing up anyway.
I was just thinking what a fool I am... trying to stay awake to watch you.
Good night, Cameron.
Is that better?
Look.
How far away is that storm?
About four miles.
Yeah.
That puts me in Mexico right now.
Since, uh, yesterday.
I think you will.
But she stays there.
Get away from him.
Get away from him.
No, Nardo!
What do you think your chances are of getting out of here?
About 60-40... maybe a little less.
A lot less.
My chances would be a lot better if you give me some instructions.
Down this canyon, about two and a half miles... you come to a road.
It goes to the left.
Indian village called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10... tell them where we are.
Your other choice is- when you get to the road, you look to the right.
They have an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could- you could be on your way to Mexico City.
I like that better.
She needs a doctor.
No reason for you both to die here... unless you want it that way.
It makes a crazy kind of sense, Meg.
I should have killed him while I had the rifle on him.
Meg, get a- get a stick or something.
Scoop the dirt from under the rock.
Your other choice is- you look to the right.
In two hours you could be on your way to Mexico City.
Some mo- more, Meg.
Under my-
Oh, come on.
Just-Just a little farther, huh, honey?
Come on.
Just-Just- Just a little ways more, huh?
Come on.
Stop!
Get into the truck.
Into the truck.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Meg.
Meg.
Hmm.
It came from the stream.
Meg
Ben!
Meg, stay back!
He was headed for Santa Isabel.
He was going for help.
How do you like that?
Go on.
Go on.
Cry.
The guy loved you.
He deserves a few tears.
Come on, Meg.
Come on.

How did you get it?
Look, sweetheart.
It was knowing about my deals that got you that jail term.
But this is all wrapped up.
No description, no photograph, no nothing.
Well, Ben or anybody else.
I wanted Ben because I wanted his wife.
Always will be.
Come on.
Drink your drink.
You mean that farmer?
I thought you were walking out on him anyhow.
But why worry about it, honey?
No, but I like him.
What about me?
I guess I love you, Nardo.
I
I guess I was wrong.
The minute I saw your face, it all came back to me.
Okay.
212, huh?
Where is she?
She left a couple of minutes ago.
Well
Right, Ben.
Can I see your registration certificate?
Was I going too fast?
Can I see your registration certificate?
This far from the border?
Nine miles.
We cover back as far as 20 miles.
At 10 miles, we have quite a few spot checks.
Sure.
Right back here.
Do you have the key?
Look, Officer.
I got to get her back home fast.
You have no right to search my car without a warrant.
Now, look, mister.
Now get that key and get it fast.
Here.
He wants me to pull up a little.
Nardo!
Leave me alone!
I was only trying to stop you, honey.
I thought you killed him- I mean, deliberately.
Come on.
The rocks have busted the gas tank.
It happens all the time.
Sheriff, give us a hand here!
Had a
On
Talk!
Meg!
Meg!
Open the door.
Meg, open the door!
And another thing.
You never saw me before in your whole life, okay?
The man you killed has four kids.
That was an accident.
She was there.
Get some decent clothes on.
All she has to do is tell the truth.
I told you to get dressed.
No!
Please let me go!
Let me go, Ben!
I need you.
The lady generates a little heat.
I wondered why you married him.
Now I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
How much would you say she was worth?
Well, I offered you $200 before, and you turned it down.
That was before you killed Harry Castleton.
A thousand.
That may be all your stinking carcass is worth.
Look.
What about hers?
Well, you would know more about that than I would.
5,000 for the whole deal.
Nah.
Will ya listen?
I believe you would.
You might decide to turn me over on this side of the border.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Ben, I
Shut up.
I picked a tramp, and I know it.
Especially for 10,000 bucks.
I got a feeling I can trust you.
You got three minutes to get dressed, pack some grub and join us.
Change of underwear.
You must have problems.
You and Meg are riding in here.
Look, Mac.
Because when you stop taking orders, I stop moving.
When the motor starts, turn the lights off.
Here.
You two get some sleep.
I know I can trust you together.
Hay?
If it means what it sounds like, uh, congratulations.
Any chance of him double-crossing us?
No.
He never made a living at it.
He almost made a square out of you, sweetheart.
A slug in my head right now would send 30,000 volts through yours.
You might get hurt.
She slides in at the base of the throat, moves straight up into the brain.
Okay.
Or any other time!
If that ever happens again, Denning-
From now on, we walk.
Most of the time, straight up.
You grab a pack.
Get your stuff together.
What if we have to turn back?
I got news for you, Mac.
You get out on the point and watch her splatter.
Better toss over that case too.
You just take care of your end.
You never liked it anyway.
Come on.
Hiya, pop.
Ben Cameron!
Hiya, Ms. Cameron.
Phew.
Well, we could save time if we had a rope.
You wait right here!
Here, here.
Let me do it.
Okay, son.
All right, Denning, you go first.
Hey, pop.
Tie the dude on, will ya?
Sure hope this holds.
Do you, uh, got that five dollars handy?
Here.
Denning, you just hold on.
Oh, wow!
Hey!
Maybe you will.
Say, uh, where is that claim of yours?
Right over here.
Come on.
Take care of this, Meg.
There she be!
You got to play it the way the cards fall.
Bury him!
Well, that ought to tie it up, especially with this fingerprint report.
That dress was found in their cabin.
As for Ben, why not?
He sold his place and moved out the night of the murder.
Ben was with me when Harry Castleton was brought in.
So Cameron helps his wife out of a jam.
After her two-timing him with that fancy Dan?
Yeah, it figures, all right.
Go ahead.
You, uh- You a music lover, Denning?
Then we start out again.
All night.
You can carry her pack.
We have all day tomorrow for sleeping.
I can walk right alongside of you night and day, Cameron.
We have to cross the upper end of the Papago Reservation.
We have to make it tonight.
Sounds reasonable.
Just how far are we from the border?
Too far.
I had to do it.
Me too.
We might never have gotten together again.
The first thing they teach you in the Marine Corps is to cover yourself.
You come first.
You make it sound like a virtue... as if it were our Christian duty to kill anyone that gets in our way.
Wait a minute.
You had nothing to do with it.
And it always will be us.
Think of the future.
Think of us together... once we get rid of that husband of yours.
As far as I can see, I never should have.
I meant when we get across the border.
Nardo, get the $10,000.
How close?
Maybe less.
We can make it alone.
This is something we waited for for three years.
Listen.
I want to get away from the rest of it.
Get gun.
Help, somebody!
Help!
What are you trying to do to me?
Nice cow.
You pay.
Drop the gun, Denning.
Pick it up.
Give it to me.
Five of those bills you got in your pocket.
We were hunting out on the reservation by mistake.
How close to the border you think we are?
I thought about five miles.
Five miles?
Why do you look at her?
Is that what she told you?
How would she know?
Something terrible.
I thought the first one was an accident.
I do my own killing.
You want a judge to do yours.
Ben, I
She kept your picture.
She was pretty crazy about you.
We can sleep till noon.
You go down there.
Ben?
Almost did.
I never saw anybody so anxious to get back to the penitentiary.
He wanted to kill you.
Well, we have a lot in common.
I want to kill him.
Yeah?
Maybe.
Besides, I want to be around when Denning dies.
Look.
Do you know why?
Not for the money?
No, not- not just for the money.
It hurts.
Go on.
Go and get some sleep.
Too painful!
Honey
Come on.
Can you make it?
Sit down.
Here, let me help.
Let me look at that arm.
How is it?
You gather it.
If he makes a wrong move, shoot him.
I got to have something dry to start it with.
Fat chance.
You got anything that might be dry?
All right, Denning.
Give it to me.
Give me my 10 grand.
9,500.
You must have trained for it.
Here.
Keep your eye on him.
The next batch oughta do it.
No.
Meg, the rifle.
I might hit you.
Just... cock the hammer... and aim like I taught you.
And thank you.
Here, baby.
Come on.
Good girl.
Here.
You lie down.
Come on.
One thing I gotta say for us, we sure got money to burn.
Oh, a fellow I know left it with me.
He was a little hot, so I held it until he cooled off.
Oh, he knew me very well.
He was my best friend.
All right, baby, come on.
Turn over, huh?
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, baby.
Raise up a little.
All right, baby, this is gonna be hot now.
Easy, honey.
Easy.
Now, baby, this is gonna hurt.
Now, you just yell as much as you want, huh?
I know, baby.
Easy.
There.
Easy.
Now, easy.
Now the dead flesh is cut away, the pain goes awfully fast.
Thank you.
What are you so nervous about?
How do you feel, huh?
If
I
But-You-You loved that scraggly old piece of desert.
Nah, I was getting a bellyful of it.
Besides, I figured it was either you or the ranch... and I
We gotta have money to stay clear.
Not that kind, Ben.
What-What can you do with it, except run for the rest of your life?
Me, honey?
Buy you some new shoes.
Pardon me.
Maybe I should have knocked.
A little more than I can afford.
Besides, the storm is clearing up anyway.
I was just thinking what a fool I am... trying to stay awake to watch you.
Good night, Cameron.
Is that better?
Look.
How far away is that storm?
About four miles.
Yeah.
That puts me in Mexico right now.
Since, uh, yesterday.
I think you will.
But she stays there.
Get away from him.
Get away from him.
No, Nardo!
What do you think your chances are of getting out of here?
About 60-40... maybe a little less.
A lot less.
My chances would be a lot better if you give me some instructions.
Down this canyon, about two and a half miles... you come to a road.
It goes to the left.
Indian village called Santa Isabel.
You go there, you give them $ 10... tell them where we are.
Your other choice is- when you get to the road, you look to the right.
They have an airplane charter service there.
In two hours you could- you could be on your way to Mexico City.
I like that better.
She needs a doctor.
No reason for you both to die here... unless you want it that way.
It makes a crazy kind of sense, Meg.
I should have killed him while I had the rifle on him.
Meg, get a- get a stick or something.
Scoop the dirt from under the rock.
Your other choice is- you look to the right.
In two hours you could be on your way to Mexico City.
Some mo- more, Meg.
Oh, come on.
Just-Just a little farther, huh, honey?
Come on.
Just-Just- Just a little ways more, huh?
Come on.
Stop!
Get into the truck.
Into the truck.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Meg.
Meg.
Hmm.
It came from the stream.
Meg
Ben!
Meg, stay back!
He was headed for Santa Isabel.
He was going for help.
How do you like that?
Go on.
Go on.
Cry.
The guy loved you.
He deserves a few tears.
Come on, Meg.
Come on.
Mighty nice transportation you got here.
You know a guy around here named Cameron
Sure, I know Ben.
He knows this country like the palm of his hand.
How far is his place?
Oh, about 22 miles straight ahead.
Then you take the left fork.
Got himself a new wife.
He stays, uh, pretty close to home these days.
Is she a nice girl?
Pretty as a picture.
City girl.
Kind of a redhead, about, oh- about 5 foot 3?
Say, you must know her.
They got married up in San Francisco, right after Ben got back from Korea.
Excuse me.
Well, that does her.
I have to haul the stuff.
It kind of ups the price a little bit.
What sort of place does he run?
Straight down the road.
Ben, look out!
Stay where you are!
Ben, are you all right?
Did he gore you?
Nah, he just stomped on me a little.
It happens all the time on a ranch.
I got to brand this fella.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I
All right, Ben.
Ooh!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben, come in here right now!
Ben, come right in here!
Here.
Just shut it off!
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!
I told you not to use it.
I told you I had to clean out the water tank.
I bet you will from now on.
Oh, get out of here!
Go on.
Get out!
All right.
All right.
Look, but that stuff dries fast in this climate.
It was right here in a tin can.
You mean that stuff that looked like brown water?
It cost 11 bucks!
Well, how did I know it was calf medicine?
Eleven bucks thrown away.
You bet I did.
Sure, sure!
At a hundred dollars a week.
This is a cattle ranch.
Honey.
Honey, there will be.
Butane is a very explosive gas.
You have.
Wha-What was it?
It was a cake, you big goon.
Or have you forgotten today was your birthday?
I guess I had.
No.
You never think about anything... except those ugly-looking cows, and you never have.
Aw, come on.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Look, what can I do, huh?
You can get the truck unloaded so you can drive me into town.
And throw in some oats and some hay.
Oh, honey, Meg.
I like it.
Where would you be if I-
Finish it.
Serving nine more years in the penitentiary for violation of parole.
Meg, forget it.
You were lonesome, you were out of the army... and you thought it was a good caper to get a girl out of a jam by marrying her.
Well, it was a good caper.
It was no way to start a marriage.
Aw, hey.
Come on.
Meg, come on now.
Forget it.
Look, baby.
Come on.
There was plenty of love with the other guy, I suppose, huh?
He got you in a jam and ran out on you.
Left you alone to face a 10-year rap!
I bet you still love the guy.
Come on.
Say it.
Meg.
One man got me into jail, and another man saved me from going back.
What do you want?
Ben Cameron?
My name is Denning.
How do you do, Mrs. Cameron?
Just, uh, what is it you want, Mr., uh, Denning?
Well, I wanted to go across the border and do some shooting at Lagos de Zapitan.
Just cross the international bridge at Arivaca.
Hire yourself a guide.
No problem at all.
Well, frankly, I was expecting to come back with a little more than the legal limit.
I want you.
Uh-huh.
Well, why me?
The only other route is 50 miles of pure up and down.
They tell me your fee is a hundred dollars a week.
Will you let me handle this?
Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.
Think it over, Mr. Cameron.
Oh, uh, by the way, my wife is driving to town.
How about giving her a lift?
Why, certainly.
Maybe I better wait till this evening, Ben, and let you drive me.
Why wait?
Let me take that.
Good-bye, Mr. Cameron.
Remember, Ben.
This is the way you wanted it.
Yeah.
I missed you, honey.
You were supposed to come back from Los Angeles that morning.
You never did.
I know.
I started, but I just never got there.
I started the night before.
Then I hit a truck on that straightaway going into Bakersfield.
Took me six months before I could even write you a letter.
So I got ahold of a lawyer.
I gave him some dough to work on your parole.
Then I had to get out of town.
I know, honey.
I got the news two weeks late.
I know, honey.
After all, we-we did find each other.
Take me into town, Nardo.
You know how I hate that.
I know, honey.
Let me take that.
Meg.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
I have a lot of thinking to do.
Hello, Mrs. Cameron.
Having a night on the town?
Ben still working?
First room up on your right.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
And this dress-Where?
Peacock Room, Palace Hotel, San Francisco.
We decided to become a team.
Ah, you do remember.
And what a team.
Best in the business.
We only took the people who could afford it.
We only took those who thought they could take us.
Nothing dishonest about that.
Remember that wildcatter in Dallas?
Boy, what a killing.
You bought me a mink coat and a diamond clip.
Yeah.
Oh, those were the days.
I hocked them when we went broke in Paris.
Listen, honey.
Okay?
That section of land next to yours is open now, if you want it.
I came to sell you my place.
Still want to buy it?
Well, I changed my mind.
Just count me out.
And when I got it, I came for you.
How did you get it?
Look, sweetheart.
It was knowing about my deals that got you that jail term.
But this is all wrapped up.
No description, no photograph, no nothing.
Well, Ben or anybody else.
I wanted Ben because I wanted his wife.
Always will be.
Come on.
Drink your drink.
You mean that farmer?
I thought you were walking out on him anyhow.
But why worry about it, honey?
No, but I like him.
What about me?
I guess I love you, Nardo.
I
I guess I was wrong.
The minute I saw your face, it all came back to me.
Okay.
212, huh?
Where is she?
She left a couple of minutes ago.
Well
Right, Ben.
Can I see your registration certificate?
Was I going too fast?
Can I see your registration certificate?
This far from the border?
Nine miles.
We cover back as far as 20 miles.
At 10 miles, we have quite a few spot checks.
Sure.
Right back here.
Do you have the key?
Look, Officer.
I got to get her back home fast.
You have no right to search my car without a warrant.
Now, look, mister.
Now get that key and get it fast.
Here.
He wants me to pull up a little.
Nardo!
Nardo, what have you done?
Meg.
Leave me alone!
I was only trying to stop you, honey.
I thought you killed him- I mean, deliberately.
Come on.
The rocks have busted the gas tank.
Look, Ben.
It happens all the time.
Sheriff, give us a hand here!
Guy... ran over me... twice.
Had a
On
Go on, Harry.
Talk!
Meg!
Meg!
Open the door.
Meg!
Meg, open the door!
And another thing.
You never saw me before in your whole life, okay?
The man you killed has four kids.
That was an accident.
She was there.
Get some decent clothes on.
All she has to do is tell the truth.
I told you to get dressed.
No!
Please let me go!
Let me go, Ben!
I need you.
The lady generates a little heat.
I wondered why you married him.
Now I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Boy- You two really deserve each other.
How much would you say she was worth?
Well, I offered you $200 before, and you turned it down.
That was before you killed Harry Castleton.
A thousand.
That may be all your stinking carcass is worth.
Look.
What about hers?
Well, you would know more about that than I would.
5,000 for the whole deal.
Nah.
Will ya listen?
I believe you would.
You might decide to turn me over on this side of the border.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Ben, I
Shut up.
I picked a tramp, and I know it.
Especially for 10,000 bucks.
I got a feeling I can trust you.
You got three minutes to get dressed, pack some grub and join us.
Change of underwear.
You must have problems.
You and Meg are riding in here.
Look, Mac.
Because when you stop taking orders, I stop moving.
In the trailer.
When the motor starts, turn the lights off.
Here.
You two get some sleep.
I know I can trust you together.
Hay?
If it means what it sounds like, uh, congratulations.
Any chance of him double-crossing us?
No.
He never made a living at it.
He almost made a square out of you, sweetheart.
A slug in my head right now would send 30,000 volts through yours.
Denning-
You might get hurt.
She slides in at the base of the throat, moves straight up into the brain.
Okay.
Or any other time!
If that ever happens again, Denning-
From now on, we walk.
Most of the time, straight up.
You grab a pack.
Get your stuff together.
What if we have to turn back?
I got news for you, Mac.

Okay.
Sure hope this holds.
Do you, uh, got that five dollars handy?
Here.
Denning, you just hold on.
Uh, you just use your feet as much as you can.
Let me down, Cameron!
Wow!
Oh, wow!
Let me down!
Hey!
Maybe you will.
Say, uh, where is that claim of yours?
Right over here.
Come on.
Take care of this, Meg.
There she be!
You got to play it the way the cards fall.
Bury him!
Well, that ought to tie it up, especially with this fingerprint report.
That dress was found in their cabin.

He sold his place and moved out the night of the murder.

Ben-
Look.
Do you know why?
Not for the money?
No, not- not just for the money.
It hurts.
Go on.
Go and get some sleep.
Too painful!
Honey
Come on.
Can you make it?
Sit down.
Here, let me help.
Let me look at that arm.
How is it?
You gather it.
If he makes a wrong move, shoot him.
I got to have something dry to start it with.
Fat chance.
You got anything that might be dry?
All right, Denning.
Give it to me.
Give me my 10 grand.
9,500.
You must have trained for it.
Here.
Keep your eye on him.
The next batch oughta do it.
No.
Meg, the rifle.
I might hit you.
Just... cock the hammer... and aim like I taught you.
And thank you.

Come on.
Good girl.
Here.
You lie down.
Come on.
One thing I gotta say for us, we sure got money to burn.
Oh, a fellow I know left it with me.
He was a little hot, so I held it until he cooled off.
Oh, he knew me very well.
He was my best friend.
All right, baby, come on.
Turn over, huh?
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, baby.
Raise up a little.
All right, baby, this is gonna be hot now.
Easy.
Easy, honey.
Easy.
Now, baby, this is gonna hurt.
Now, you just yell as much as you want, huh?
I know.
I know, baby.
Easy.
There.
Easy.
Now, easy.
Now the dead flesh is cut away, the pain goes awfully fast.
Thank you.
What are you so nervous about?

How far away is that storm?
About four miles.
Yeah.
That puts me in Mexico right now.
Since, uh, yesterday.
I think you will.
But she stays there.
Get away from him.
Get away from him.
No, Nardo!

Just-Just- Just a little ways more, huh?
Come on.
Stop!
Get into the truck.
Into the truck.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Meg.
Meg.
Hmm.
It came from the stream.
Meg
Ben!
Meg, stay back!
He was headed for Santa Isabel.
He was going for help.
How do you like that?
Go on.
Go on.
Cry.
The guy loved you.
He deserves a few tears.
Come on, Meg.
Come on.
La Vie financière, please.
Thanks.
Hullo, is that the police?
Louis, we better ditch the car.
Louis, not there, eh.
Are you gonna shut up?
Do we split now?
Hang on.
Why?
Wait for the others.
Count it.
15 million.
How does that divvy up?
3 million each.
3 each?
Not more.
We gotta pay the guy who fixed the job.
But not a whole share.
Yeah.
That was the agreement with the guy.
How can we be sure of that?
What are you getting at?
The guy has never seen you, while I... if he squeals...
You could also chicken out and talk.
You were shitting yourself in the car.
Take that back, Raymond, or...
Frédo, I swear you have all the nerve of an old woman.
Is this a stick-up?
Whadda you wanna say?
It must be stress...
or nerves...
like you say.
No, Pépito.
No.
You dare... pull a gun on us!
Raymond, you go along to help with the payment.
You bet!
Else he just might think about screwing us.
Beat it.
For tonight, it still stands?
Yeah, at the bar as usual.
Whadda you think of Frédo?
Come off it!
You going to your hotel?
I should give them some money.
Say hi to your wife for me.
Come for a bite some evening.
You off to the track, this afternoon?
Oh... shit!
I was given a sure thing for the fourth race.
Rubbish.
Drop by the caravan first and leave a little moolah.
Divvy up soon, right ?
See you.
OK.
Hey!
tell me....
Would that be your winner?
This is crazy!
I hope so.
You can tell him.
I assure you that it was there yesterday.
Are you dining with me tonight?
No.
Not with another woman?
Yes.
An infant.
Anyway, see you tomorrow.
You want me to wear my blue dress?
You may.
It cost me enough.
The pneumatic hoist, same cost as my appartment.
I needed to modernise a bit.
You want to see the accounts.
Not now.
He wanted to buy the land It would have looked good.
2 nightclubs side by side.
Talk about competition.
Now we can expand.
What are we looking for for this work?
2.5 million pesos.
Where do you want me to take it?
Last time in Caracas I gave you 10.
Wait a sec.
The main thing, is that you agree.
This is money for jam.
This is good for your friend Fredo.
That old rascal, it must be 10 years since I saw him.
As mean as ever?
Always the miser.
And his floozy?
Nowadays his floozy is a respectable lady:
Shack in the suburbs, slippers by the fire, mass on Sundays.
You know the type?
As you get older you whitewash yourself.
A christening?
No, a bit of a party.
You gotta stay...you can see your old pal,
Once upon a time, a veritable lion.
I think your lion has lost his mane.
How many bottles have you put on ice?
These here.
And there are others.
This is all I got to bring back.
Hi, Linotte.
The American!
Salut, Antoine.
So you had your beard trimmed?
I was robbed.
Bonsoir, Frédo.
Payday, eh?
.
Just a bit of a stomach.
When he came to New York every time a Yank spoke, he asked me:
Old scoundrel.
Excuse me a minute.
See you all later.
I took the guy his dough.
Good-oh!
Set a place for me.
Antoine, there needs to be flowers here.
We do have florists.
Frédo...
There, Grenouille, go and find us some flowers.
Flowers are expensive in winter.
Bonsoir, maman.
Bonsoir, Louis.
Bonsoir, madame Frédo.
Hortense!
Delighted to see you again.
Bonsoir, madame Frédo.
Madame Frédo, my homages.
May I present...
Monsieur Pépito, manners, please!
.
Dinner is served, ladies.
Mme Frédo will place the table.
Louis, on my left,
Zé on my right, and Madame opposite me.
Well I never!
It was dusty.
Voilà, my beauty.
Frédo, tell your broad to clam up.
Leave it alone.
Mademoiselle, the lemon, please.
Louis, pass me a little butter.
Grenouille, go and draw the curtains.
You too, sweetie.
Hervieux.
Open the door.
What have you been up to?
I think of you, you know.
Turn off the light.
We make a good couple.
Our worries will soon be over.
Whadda you thinking?
I think the golden-sheepskin would suit me better.
Hélène, wake up.
I gotta hurry.
There, monsieur.
Hey there!
Whadda you doing?
Take it easy, Pierre Bertain.
Quietly.
You want to go to HQ sir?
No.
Go to the nearest station.
You been whooping it up all night!
Shuddup.
Good morning gentlemen.
This is for us?
Siddown.
You know the penalty?
Infraction of your parole restrictions:
2 or 3 months.
Gimme a break.
Lemme keep going.
2 or 3 months?
More.
Especially if there are false papers.
Have you got your area restriction passbook?
There are no forms here, in this dump.
Of course, but...
But what?
Dunno... he might be given a permit to move around.
With a police assistance pass.
With one of those, he could circulate freely.
Did you here that?
That you can walk out of here free?
Just that, free.
And even better, free to remain in Paris.
Are you just trying to wind me up?
Why would you let me go?
What do I have to do?
Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Just give us 1 or 2 tips.
You should be well acquainted with a few thieves?
or something along those lines.
But who said anything about Lagny?
You can stay there.
No need to return to Lagny.
Ok sign this.
Come on.
Sign here.
I know nothing.
If you come back to Paris, you know my conditions.
To get me, phone HQ.
Turbigo 9200.
Extension 907.
Ask for officer Pluvier.
Get in there.
Move it, you too.
You going to keep me long?
The superintendent will decide.
Yeah.
You seem out of sorts.
With the life you lead...
I heard you come in.
The clock said 5.
I was out on a bender with friends.
I ask myself just how you do it.
You know what that led to!
13 months in the can and 5 years stick for some tires...
But I have some well-placed friends who are gonna try and have his ban lifted.
You think they can?
I hope so.
To stop the stuff-ups.
Exactly, he wrote me.
Will you take me along?
You expecting someone?
Pierre Bertain has given me a message for his mother.
Come in.
Who is it?
A faggot, maman.
A what?
Pierrot has sent us a faggot.
Curious way of announcing me.
Your from Lagny?
Where have you seen my brother?
Just at the police station.
Had he been arrested?
Yes.
He takes the 11am wagon.
Then?
This morning he was taken to a security cell.
I want you to know that I am victim of a miscarriage of justice.
Last night I found myself near a public convenience, the police have conclu...
And my brother?
Your brother asked me to warn you:
He was sent to the depot.
Where did they pick him up?
Near Avenue Bolivar.
Good.
Au revoir, madame.
Take it.
I was just doing a favor.
Take it.
You can buy yourself a new handbag.
Au revoir.
Thanks.
Buck up, Maman.
What was he doing up to at Avenue Bolivar?
How would I know?
Hélène!
Still with that piece of....?
I forbad him see her, the little jerk!
Louis!
I should go.
Clémence will be waiting for me.
That kid!
That kid!
Bye, big-boy.
Bonjour, Louis.
A pack of Chesterfields?
Cheers, Louis.
Gimme some change, Maurice.
Have one, Bébert?
Here, have a game on me.
Thanks, Louis.
What do take me for?
You better believe it.
Cheerio.
Get your oranges!
Oranges, oranges!
See you then.
Beautiful oranges!
Buy my oranges!
Who wants oranges?
Finest oranges!
Is that OK, sir?
Thanks.
Do you need to know someone long before accepting an invitation?
Yes.
Is he young?
Yes.
Handsome?
Yes.
Is he rich?
His father is.
Who are the chocolates for?
The gentlemen opposite.
Here you are, monsieur.
Put them there.
Excuse me.
What do I owe you?
6000 francs, monsieur.
Keep the change.
Merci, monsieur.
Is there no way at all to arrange this lunch?
Like every Wednesday.
And if I should have a word with this young man?
There, my sweet, your tip.
Fine.
With the manicure, 1500.
Pardon, monsieur.
She would have warned me.
I arrived unexpectedly.
What are you getting at?
That you should beat it.
And at full speed.
Whadda you mean?
but, monsieur...
He was charming.
How about lunch at the Cascade?
Fine.
What do you do exactly?
How about we take a bit of a walk to work up an appetite?
OK?
OK.
I would have loved to do horse-riding.
Have you done it?
Yes, in the artillery.
You have a pretty laugh.
But with you I feel good.
Are you cold?
A bit.
Not yet.
Apart from the youngster in the car, anyone else?
No.
A woman always needs a man to help her.
You slut!
I forbid you to see him again, you understand?
I forbid you!
You did say Industrial and Commercial Bank, one Pug 203, blue panelvan body?
Armored?
No.
Number 8021 BA 78, leaves Dourdan at 2pm towards Étampes.
Sure.
Are they sweet peas?
I treat mine with compost.
On the whole you gain with that.
And still we talk about the high life.
Suez, OK.
But phosphates?
Have you seen how much they are?
27,000.
I thought you paid 30 for them.
Whose been kidding you?
I never said that
Did you get a flat?
Yes.
Thorn, stone...
I dunno.
Oh, to be young again.
Come through here, maman.
A Malaga for my mother and two small Ricards.
No.
You can always find time to write.
Thanks.
Sound good?
Look at him.
He sees himself in a collar and tie already .
Cheers!
Happy now?
And how!
Wish I was there.
Beef stew?
Of course, my son.
You want me to dine alone?
Ah well, off you go.
Au revoir, Hélène.
My feet go wild.
Au revoir.
Au revoir.
Thursday, then?
Can I come up?
Whadda you mean?
Ask your brother.
Bravo!
Your chances are coming back.
Bonsoir, monsieur.
Sleep well.
Have fun!
Au revoir.
Yesterday Mimile phoned Fredo.
Some heavies are driving with the loot.
No.
What the hell are you doing here?
You hear me?
So answer.
No, Louis.
I was taking a nap.
Louis...
Take it from me, Pépito.
Keep cool.
No, no.
Pierre...
I swear it, Louis.
On what?
What?
That I will speak to no one.
Good.
Why did you come back so early?
I gave you enough to play with.
You wanted to see Hélène again.
Answer my question!
I forbid you to chase after that screwed up...!
Louis!
Have you no shame?
Your little brother?
Louis!
Are you crazy?
Scram, bikes are coming.
Come on, Raymond.
Bravo, Raymond.
The other one.
You see, Louis?
Whadda you waiting for?
Raymond!
Frédo, your go, go on!
Piece of shit!
Hang in there.
The bullet holes will make us obvious.
Stop, you arsehole!
We gotta torch the wagon.
His helmet saved his life.
And the first man?
Oh!
You alone?
Mimile had a nose for it.
The 60 seem to be there.
Have you ever seen him miss the split, that one?
When I think what he made us today.
But surely not a full share for Frédo?
For that shit.
You want to send him packing?
No.
You can find another gang.
Whatta you gonna do?
Take a trip.
Yep.
I wonder what a new life can give.
What are you doing there?
Your golden-sheepskin.
Come in.
Put it on the table.
Quickly...open it.
Thank you.
Help me put it on.
I wanna know, about the Bois de Boulogne woods.
Pass me my scarf.
With this coat...
Hélène...
What happened?
Nothing.
He came to invite me out, supposedly to speak about you.
We were close by the Cascade restaurant...
It was nothing.
No, go on.
Just that, nothing.
He made some... propositions.
He got fresh, then I slapped him.
Is that all it was that he refused to tell me?
Take it easy.
Go sit down.
It really suits me you know.
Hullo?
I thought he was with you.
When your nerves crack, you can expect anything.
OK.
Are you sick?
No.
Tell me what it is.
Nothing.... promise.
What is it?
You can get out then.
Pierre!
Hélène, if you knew...
Hélène, it was my brother who pulled the Dourdan job.
They robbed a bank and killed two guys.
Freeze!
You seen le Blond?
We were to meet at 9.
The cops hauled him off.
Oh, Mi-Fa-Sol!
OK...
OK.
A burglar, me?
But you admitted tonight...
Be sensible.
Sign here as you promised.
What...!
Did I say that?
Well?
You going to stuff us around for long
Speak up!
...
you hear me?
We know everything.
We know who sold you out.
So ask them.
Raoul, bring in you know what.
So... what do you think of that?
Pretty, eh?
Give in!
And tell us where to find The Gypsy.
Out with it!
Take a photo.
It was found at his place.
She followed us.
She hopes to see him.
No way.
She seems prepared to wait.
Let her wait.
Come on, admit it.
Stop it.
Word of honor.
Out here!
Happy to see your old friend?
You can stop your performance.
Who were you with at Dourdan?
With Raymond, The Gypsy... and Louis.
Who gave you the job?
Émile, who runs a bar on the Dourdan road.
10 million was for him.
Who hit the motorcyclists?
The Gypsy and The Sailor.
Who decided to throw The Sailor out onto the road?
Louis.
Who stuck up the bank?
We did.
Who came here to HQ this morning?
Who asked to see me?
Who fingered the whole gang?
I had to.
I was scared, scared, scared.
Can you understand?
I was terrified of you, The Gypsy, the cops, everybody.
You gotta understand!
I had to!
Too much killing!
Too much killing!
Too much killing, I tell you.
Too much killing!
Too much killing!
You can finish this puppet show.
lunch.
And give the photo of The Gypsy to the press.
Get up.
Hook him up.
Good-oh!
Send in a man to guard him.
Enjoy your lunch.
Will you bring me a snack?
You can starve, scumbag.
You got a butt, chief?
Or maybe not.
Understood, chief.
What do you prefer?
Paté or sausage-loaf?
Whatever you like.
You have my full confidence.
I like night shift.
Not for me.
War teaches you nothing.
How?
I made it through the last one.
No...
I tried other things
Me neither.
Then there was my wife, Paris meant nothing to her.
You know how it is.
Her uncle had lodgings at the Bastille.
When she came and saw all the cinemas and stuff, she was hooked.
Parents?
No.
What?
I need a piss.
Hurry up.
It takes time.
Just a minute.
Go pay the taxidriver, Grenouille.
Just a smidgen more.
Leave it there.
Put everybody wise to that.
You need lolly?
Yeah.
How much?
A 100 thou, OK?
A piece.
Ciao, Antoine, and thanks for everything.
Ciao.
Bébert!
He wanted to see her.
Bolivar Place, 5 or 6.
Hang on, here he is.
Yes.
I must find my brother.
Go up to our place.
Tell him to lock himself in and answer the door to no-one.
No-one, understand.
Tell me, have you seen The Gypsy?
What?
Is Pierre there?
Yes...
Louis?
Listen, Pépito...
Give us another one.
I told you...
You crazy piece of shit.
Speak up, scum!
Piece of shit!
Go... you scum.
Through there up the stairs.
Come on!
This way.
FatPlank
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that english kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is NichoIson.
I am colonel Saito.
In the name of His imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
battalion, stand at ease.
fall out, Major Hughes.
battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
mostly Aussies.
Some Iime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has CIipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
AII right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps col.
NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears--
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
But may I add another word?
please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the Iaw, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
english prisoners!
Notice I do not say english soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
AII men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, colonel Saito to article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read english, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absoIved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
AII enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
battalion, take up tools.
Move to the Ieft in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, colonel....
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I couId have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I couId have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
also two others, corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, CIipton, I understand.
truly.
No.
principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
well?
should a tragedy occur, it wouId be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
battalion, attention.
english prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
AII work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
english corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London PoIytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers beIow--
No officers will do manual labour.
please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
CIipton did mention that.
please sit down.
Now.
tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
DemoraIization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
battalion, attention!
battalion, stand at ease.
please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
incorrectly?
unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
AII the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
colonel, it wouId save time if we could work during dinner.
would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
AII I need is love.
AII you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is in the botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
general salute!
general salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
well, come along, then.
col.
Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you Iike with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
would you Iike to see where you were?
AII right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
MaIaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
col.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
actually, col.
Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
well....
Good show!
Oh, colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
really?
Good show!
jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
hello, CIipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no Ionger abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, CIipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
hold him!
hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
AII right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
exactly what did you do?
well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
could you use it in cold blood?
could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
well, at Ieast he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
blast!
This is awkward.
silly, it never occurred to me!
well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
tell that to Chapman.
lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
jolly good fun.
jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I couId have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
explosives and L-piIIs go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that colonel NichoIson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
AII right.
Come on.
still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
AII clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
AII right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it wouId turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I Iove India.
But there are times....
suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a Iong and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
help!
kill him!
kill him!
Let me go, sir!
kill him!
kill him!
kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears--
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till l--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
Two jumps, 80º/0.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears--
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
it was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Here lies--
Ah, yes.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
Well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
I think he understands the situation now.
I must be pushing on.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
I understand how you feel.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
Queer bird, even for an American.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
You read English, I take it?
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He only suggested--
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir?
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Take this bridge of yours.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
I know our men.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
That would be something.
Good morning.
Down on the beach.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
Like a martini?
Of course.Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
Carry on, driver.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
Wait a minute.
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Utterly charming.
It has such a melodramatic air.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
By the way, I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, thejapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
Lucky you.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Is this your photograph?
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
A simulated major.
That figures.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
Are you all right?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
You were in need of medical attention?
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
What was the answer?
Thank you,Joyce.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
Cambridge don and all that.
Fascinating story.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
He hates thejapanese.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Go ahead.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
Read it.
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Good hunting.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Heave!
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on,Joyce.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, Major.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by thejapanese.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble forJoyce.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Do it now.
Why?
As you please.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Here lies--
Ah, yes.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
Well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
I think he understands the situation now.
I must be pushing on.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
I understand how you feel.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
Queer bird, even for an American.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
You read English, I take it?
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He only suggested--
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir?
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
I only have 12 weeks.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Take this bridge of yours.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
I know our men.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
That would be something.
Good morning.
Down on the beach.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
Like a martini?
Of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 10:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
Carry on, driver.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy, Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
You see?
Wait a minute.
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Utterly charming.
It has such a melodramatic air.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
Here is the River Kwai...
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, the Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
Lucky you.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Is this your photograph?
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
A simulated major.
That figures.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
Are you all right?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
You were in need of medical attention?
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
What was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
Cambridge don and all that.
Fascinating story.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
He hates the Japanese.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Go ahead.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
Read it.
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Good hunting.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Heave!
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, Major.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble for Joyce.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Do it now.
Why?
As you please.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I...
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now...
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant...
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now...
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your CINC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your CINC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new L pill.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Now, look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears...
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labor.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80%.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Subtitles by Gelula/SDI
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Here lies--
Ah, yes.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
Well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
I think he understands the situation now.
I must be pushing on.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
I understand how you feel.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
Queer bird, even for an American.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
You read English, I take it?
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He only suggested--
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir?
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Take this bridge of yours.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
I know our men.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
That would be something.
Good morning.
Down on the beach.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
Like a martini?
Of course.Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
Carry on, driver.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
Wait a minute.
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Utterly charming.
It has such a melodramatic air.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
By the way, I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, thejapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
Lucky you.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Is this your photograph?
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
A simulated major.
That figures.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
Are you all right?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
You were in need of medical attention?
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
What was the answer?
Thank you,Joyce.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
Cambridge don and all that.
Fascinating story.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
He hates thejapanese.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Go ahead.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
Read it.
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Good hunting.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Heave!
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on,Joyce.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, Major.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by thejapanese.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble forJoyce.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Do it now.
Why?
As you please.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Here lies--
Ah, yes.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
Well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, You will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard...
You will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, You can finish that shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
I think he understands the situation now.
I must be pushing on.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
I understand how you feel.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
Queer bird, even for an American.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
From the moment you surrendered...
You ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
You read English, I take it?
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order Your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count...
You and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He only suggested--
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir?
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, You are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think You quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Take this bridge of yours.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
I know our men.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
That would be something.
Good morning.
Down on the beach.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
Like a martini?
Of course.Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
Carry on, driver.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
Wait a minute.
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Utterly charming.
It has such a melodramatic air.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears...
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasión I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80%.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokio signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it. I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes. I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape. lt was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new L pill.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it. I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears...
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasión I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80%.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokio signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Subtitles by GelulalSDI
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears...
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasión I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80%.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokio signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Subtitles by GelulalSDI
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears...
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labor.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80%.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears--
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
it was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!

Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it. I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes. I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape. lt was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new L pill.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it. I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
FINISH WORK.
GO TO HUT.
YEAH, THAT FIGURES.
THOSE NEW PRISONERS SEE US DIGGING GRAVES, THEY MIGHT ALL RUN AWAY.
NO TIME FOR JOKES.
FINISH WORK.
DIG, DIG !
HEY, HOW ABOUT PUTTING US ON SICK LIST ?
PUT US IN HOSPITAL.
YOU NO SICK.
YOU NEVER SICK.
WHY YOU ALWAYS PLAY SICK TO ME, SHEARS ?
CAPTAIN KANEMATSU, HOW ABOUT A BUTT ?
I GIVE YOU BUTT THIS MORNING, BOTH OF YOU.
I WANT TO RETURN THE FAVOR.
WHEN A MAN GIVES ME SOMETHING FROM THE GOODNESS OF HIS HEART,
LIKE YOU GAVE ME THAT BUTT THIS MORNING, I REMEMBER IT FROM THE HEART.
YOU THINK I STOLE IT ?
IT BELONGED TO THAT ENGLISH KID WE JUST BURIED OVER THERE.
AND BEFORE I PASS ON, I WANT TO DO THE SAME FOR YOU.
OKAY, YOU GO ON SICK LIST.
HIM TOO.
FAR AWAY.
HERE LIES--
THOMPSON.
OH, YES.
HERE LIES CORPORAL HERBERT THOMPSON,
SERIAL NUMBER 01234567,
WHO DIED OF BERIBERI IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1943...
FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF--
WHAT DID HE DIE FOR ?
AH, COME OFF IT.
NO NEED TO MOCK THE GRAVE.
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.
HE FOUND LITTLE ENOUGH OF IT WHILE HE WAS ALIVE.
FORM A LINE NOW !
COMPANY,HALT!
BATTALION...
HALT!
IN THE LINE...
LEFT TURN !
STAND AT EASE !
STAND EASY !
WELL DONE, WELL DONE.
YOU GONNA TELL HIM THE TRUTH, COMMANDER ?
OF COURSE NOT.
BATTALION...
STAND !
MY NAME IS NICHOLSON.
I AM COLONEL SAITO.
IN THE NAME OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY...
I WELCOME YOU.
I AM THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THIS CAMP,
WHICH IS CAMP 16...
ALONG THE GREAT RAILROAD...
WHICH WILL SOON CONNECT BANGKOK WITH RANGOON.
YOU BRITISH PRISONERS HAVE BEEN CHOSEN...
TO BUILD A BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER KWAI.
IT WILL BE PLEASANT WORK...
REQUIRING SKILL,
AND OFFICERS WILL WORK AS WELL AS MEN.
THE JAPANESE ARMY CANNOT HAVE IDLE MOUTHS TO FEED.
IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU WILL BE TREATED WELL.
BUT IF YOU DO NOT WORK HARD,
YOU WILL BE PUNISHED !
A WORD TO YOU ABOUT ESCAPE.
THERE IS NO BARBED WIRE,
NO STOCKADE, NO WATCHTOWER.
THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY.
WE ARE ON AN ISLAND IN THE JUNGLE.
ESCAPE IS IMPOSSIBLE.
YOU WOULD DIE !
TODAY YOU REST.
TOMORROW YOU WILL BEGIN.
DISMISSED !
BATTALION, STAND AT EASE !
FALL OUT, MAJOR HUGHES.
BATTALION, STAND AT EASE.
HUGHES, GET THE MEN TO THEIR QUARTERS.
TELL CLIPTON TO SEE TO THE SICK.
VERY GOOD.
COLONEL!
I HEARD YOUR REMARKS JUST NOW, SIR.
I CAN ASSURE YOU MY MEN WILL CARRY ON IN THE WAY ONE EXPECTS OF THE BRITISH SOLDIER.
AND NATURALLY, MY OFFICERS AND I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CONDUCT.
SIR, YOU MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT THE USE OF OFFICERS FOR MANUAL LABOR...
IS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN BY THE GENEVA CONVENTION.
IS THAT SO ?
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A COPY OF THE CONVENTION WITH ME...
AND WOULD BE GLAD TO LET YOU GLANCE THROUGH IT, IF YOU WISH.
THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY.
ATTENTION !
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
YES, SIR.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
AH, CLIPTON.
NEARLY HEALED, SIR.
OH, SIR, THIS IS COMMANDER SHEARS OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
GOOD HEAVENS !
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR ?
WE FOUND HIM AND AN AUSTRALIAN.
THE U.S. NAVY, OUT HERE ?
FOR A DEEPWATER SAILOR, I AM SORT OF LANDLOCKED.
YOU LOST YOUR SHIP ?
THE HOUSTON.
I MADE IT ASHORE, BUT I GOT SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER SURVIVORS.
AND YOUR GROUP HERE ?
MOSTLY AUSSIES, SOME LIME--
SOME BRITISH, INDIANS, BURMESE, SIAMESE.
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM ?
THEY DIED...
OF MALARIA, DYSENTERY, BERIBERI, GANGRENE.
OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH:
FAMINE, OVERWORK,
BULLET WOUNDS, SNAKE BITES, SAITO.
AND THERE WERE SOME WHO JUST GOT TIRED OF LIVING.
HAS CLIPTON HAD A LOOK AT YOU ?
JUST ABOUT TO, SIR.
COME OVER HERE, COMMANDER.
YOU CAN SHAVE LATER.
ALL RIGHT.
BESIDES, THIS IS WORKING KIT.
THE OFFICERS IN YOUR PARTY DID MANUAL LABOR ?
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.
SAITO.
I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION NOW.
IS THAT SO ?
I MUST SAY HE SEEMS QUITE A REASONABLE TYPE.
WELL, I MUST BE PUSHING ON.
GIVE ME YOUR REQUIREMENTS.
YES, SIR.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO.
OH, THANK YOU, SIR.
WHAT IS IT ?
NEVER MIND.
GO ON, SAY IT.
I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF THINGS TO CALL SAITO,
PERHAPS COLONEL NICHOLSON DEFINES THE WORD DIFFERENTLY.
ANY OTHER POINTS ?
BY YOUR LEAVE, SIR.
YES, JENNINGS ?
ABOUT THE ESCAPE COMMITTEE, SIR.
LT.
JENNINGS HAS A PLAN.
WHERE ?
INTO THIS JUNGLE ?
THAT FELLOW SAITO IS RIGHT.
NO NEED FOR BARBED WIRE HERE.
ONE CHANCE IN A HUNDRED OF SURVIVAL.
RIGHT.
BUT MAY I ADD ANOTHER WORD, COLONEL.
PLEASE.
THE ODDS AGAINST SURVIVAL IN THIS CAMP ARE EVEN WORSE.
TO GIVE UP HOPE OF ESCAPE, TO EVEN STOP THINKING ABOUT IT...
IS LIKE ACCEPTING A DEATH SENTENCE.
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
BUT MY MEN AND I ARE INVOLVED IN A CURIOUS LEGAL POINT OF WHICH YOU ARE UNAWARE.
IN SINGAPORE, WE WERE ORDERED TO SURRENDER BY COMMAND HEADQUARTERS.
ORDERED, MIND YOU.
THEREFORE, IN OUR CASE,
ESCAPE MIGHT WELL BE AN INFRACTION OF MILITARY LAW.
INTERESTING ?
YES, INTERESTING POINT.
YOU MEAN, YOU INTEND TO UPHOLD THE LETTER OF THE LAW, NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ?
WITHOUT LAW, COMMANDER, THERE IS NO CIVILIZATION.
HERE, THERE IS NO CIVILIZATION.
THEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE IT.
I SUGGEST WE DROP THE SUBJECT OF ESCAPE.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ?
I WANT EVERYTHING TO GO OFF WITHOUT A HITCH STARTING TOMORROW MORNING.
AND REMEMBER THIS:
OUR MEN MUST ALWAYS FEEL THEY ARE STILL COMMANDED BY US AND NOT BY THE JAPANESE.
ARE YOU WITH ME THERE, COMMANDER ?
WELL, I, UH-- I HOPE THEY CAN REMAIN SOLDIERS, COLONEL.
QUEER BIRD, EVEN FOR AN AMERICAN.
CUT OFF FROM HIS UNIT.
THAT SHOULD BE A LESSON TO ALL OF US.
ATTENTION !
ENGLISH PRISONERS !
FROM THE MOMENT YOU SURRENDERED,
YOU CEASED TO BE SOLDIERS.
YOU WILL FINISH THE BRIDGE BY THE 12th DAY OF MAY.
YOU WILL WORK UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A JAPANESE ENGINEER,
LIEUTENANT MIURA.
TIME IS SHORT.
ALL MEN WILL WORK !
YOUR OFFICERS WILL WORK BESIDE YOU.
THIS IS ONLY JUST.
FOR IT IS THEY WHO BETRAYED YOU BY SURRENDER.
YOUR SHAME IS THEIR DISHONOR.
IT IS THEY WHO TOLD YOU,
IT IS THEY WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE, NOT I !
THEREFORE, THEY WILL JOIN YOU IN USEFUL LABOR.
THAT IS ALL.
OFFICER PRISONERS, COLLECT YOUR TOOLS.
BRADLEY, BACK IN YOUR PLACE.
I MUST CALL YOUR ATTENTION, COL.
SAITO, TO ARTICLE 27 OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION.
GIVE ME THE BOOK.
BY ALL MEANS.
YOU READ ENGLISH, I TAKE IT.
DO YOU READ JAPANESE ?
YOU SPEAK TO ME OF CODE ?
WHAT CODE ?
OF BUSHIDO ?
NOTHING !
YOU ARE UNWORTHY OF COMMAND !
SINCE YOU REFUSE TO ABIDE BY THE LAWS OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD,
WE MUST CONSIDER OURSELVES ABSOLVED FROM OUR DUTY TO OBEY YOU.
MY OFFICERS WILL NOT DO MANUAL LABOR.
WE SHALL SEE.
ALL ENLISTED PRISONERS TO WORK !
SERGEANT MAJOR, TAKE THE MEN TO WORK.
SIR.
BATTALION, TAKE UP TOOLS !
MOVE TO THE LEFT, KEEP IN COLUMN AND ROWS.
TO THE LEFT, MARCH !
COMPANY, FOLLOW THE LINE !
FORWARD MARCH !
EYES FRONT !
EYESRIGHT!
NOW YOU WILL BE REASONABLE.
YOU WILL ORDER YOUR OFFICERS TO WORK.
NO.
I WILL COUNT THREE.
IF BY THE THIRD COUNT...
YOU AND YOUR OFFICERS ARE NOT ON THE WAY TO WORK,
I WILL GIVE THE ORDER TO FIRE.
SAITO.
TWO.
COL.
SO HAS EVERY MAN IN THE HOSPITAL.
THERE ARE TOO MANY WITNESSES.
SHUT UP !
YOU SEE, JENNINGS, THERE ARE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES TO BEING ON THE SICK LIST.
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH RODE THE 600.
THAT KIND OF GUTS.
ALSO THE KIND THEY HAD IN 1914...
WHEN YOUR OFFICERS WENT OVER THE TOP WITH NOTHING BUT A SWAGGER STICK.
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.
THE KIND OF GUTS THAT CAN GET US ALL KILLED.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
REALLY IT IS.
WHAT ABOUT HIM ?
HE ONLY SUGGESTED--
LISTEN, KIDDO.
COL.
SAITO SAYS ALL OFFICERS TO PUNISHMENT HUT.
TELL THEM TO GO.
NOT YOU.
COME.
¶ AND SO SAY ALL OF US ¶
¶ AND SO SAY ALL OF US ¶
¶ AND SO SAY ALL OF US ¶
¶ AND SO SAY ALL OF US ¶¶
HURRAY !
HURRAY !
HURRAY !
SPEED UP !
ONE, TWO, THREE, PULL !
NO, NO, NO !
LET GO !
LET GO !
YOU WISH TO SEE ME ?
NICHOLSON.
I COULD HAVE YOU SHOT.
THOSE PRISONERS WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE-- THEY WERE IN YOUR CHARGE.
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ESCAPE.
IT DOES NOT MATTER.
ONE MUST EVEN RESPECT THOSE WHO TRIED.
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT BETWEEN ESCAPE AND DEATH...
THEY WERE SOLDIERS AGAIN.
BUT IT IS INSANE TO TRY AND ESCAPE.
TWO SOLDIERS SHOT, THE THIRD DROWNED !
TO WHAT END ?
IT WAS AN ESCAPE FROM REALITY.
HERE IS REALITY.
THIS SHOWS THE POSITION WORK SHOULD HAVE REACHED BY NOON TODAY,
AND THIS SHOWS THE POSITION OF ACTUAL PROGRESS.
WE ARE FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE !
THAT IS NOT ALL.
ENLISTED PRISONERS SABOTAGE THE WORK.
YES, I HAVE SEEN IT.
I COULD HAVE THEM ALL SHOT.
THEN WHO WOULD BUILD YOUR BRIDGE ?
MY OFFICERS WILL DIRECT THEM.
YOUR OFFICERS WILL WORK BESIDE THEM.
NICHOLSON TO DECIDE.
DO NOT SPEAK TO ME OF RULES.
THIS IS WAR !
THIS IS NOT A GAME OF CRICKET.
QUITE MAD.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
I HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW YOU ONE VISIT TO YOUR COLONEL.
THANK YOU.
TELL HIM THAT IF HIS OFFICERS WILL NOT WORK,
AND YOUR PATIENTS WILL WORK IN THEIR PLACE.
MANY WILL DIE, AND HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE.
GO AND SPEAK TO HIM.
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES.
SIR ?
I BROUGHT YOU A FEW THINGS.
FINE, SIR.
FINE.
WE SCRAPED TOGETHER A LITTLE MEAT AND A COCONUT.
A-AND THE OFFICERS ?
AND LT.
JENNINGS-- JENNINGS IS DEAD.
WHAT ?
KILLED ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE.
ALSO TWO OTHERS WITH HIM.
CORPORAL WEAVER AND THE AMERICAN.
JENNINGS-- POOR, BRAVE LAD.
CARRY ON.
BLACKMAIL.
I KNOW, SIR, BUT HE MEANS IT.
THAN SUFFOCATING IN THAT HOLE ?
THE MEN ARE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB.
AND IF HE MAKES THE SICK MEN WORK,
YES, CLIPTON, I UNDERSTAND, TRULY.
NO.
PRINCIPLE ?
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW OR CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO US.
GIVE IN, SIR.
PLEASE.
I WILL NOT HAVE AN OFFICER FROM MY BATTALION WORKING AS A COOLIE.
TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
PLEASE THANK THOSE CONCERNED.
EVERYBODY IN THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTED ONE PIECE.
REYNOLDS STOLE THE COCONUT.
OH.
GOOD-BYE, SIR, AND GOOD LUCK.
MANY THANKS.
CLIPTON !
SIR ?
DID YOU SAY THAT AMERICAN CHAP WAS KILLED ?
YES, SIR.
SHOT AND DROWNED.
HMM.
THREE MEN KILLED, AND TO WHAT END ?
TIME.
HERE.
TIME.
TIME.
THE DOC JUST LOOKED AT US AND SHOOK HIS HEAD, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
MEANS ONLY ONE THING:
WELL ?
COL.
SHOULD A TRAGEDY OCCUR, IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO MURDER.
HE IS RESPONSIBLE, NOT I.
YOU SICK ?
ARE THEY BOTH MAD...
OR AM I GOING MAD ?
OR IS IT THE SUN ?
BATTALION, ATTENTION !
ENGLISH PRISONERS, LET US ASK THE QUESTION:
WHY DOES THE BRIDGE NOT PROGRESS ?
YOU KNOW WHY.
BECAUSE YOUR OFFICERS ARE LAZY !
THEY THINK THEMSELVES TOO GOOD TO SHARE YOUR BURDENS.
THIS IS NOT JUST.
THEREFORE, YOU ARE NOT HAPPY IN YOUR WORK.
THEREFORE, THE BRIDGE DOES NOT PROGRESS.
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CAUSE.
I DO NOT HIDE THE TRUTH.
WITH DEEP SHAME AND REGRET, I ADMIT TO YOU...
THE FAILURE OF A MEMBER OF THE JAPANESE STAFF.
I REFER TO LT.
MIURA.
THEREFORE, I HAVE REMOVED HIM FROM HIS POST.
TOMORROW WE BEGIN AGAIN.
I SHALL BE IN PERSONAL COMMAND.
TODAY WE REST.
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKE JACK A DULL BOY.
AS TOKEN OF REGARD FOR YOUR EFFORT IN THE FUTURE,
I GIVE PRESENTS TO YOU ALL.
LET US BE HAPPY IN OUR WORK.
COMPANY...
DISMISS.
BATTALION, DISMISSED !
HEY, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS !
RED CROSS ?
SHHH.
HEY, LARRY, LOOK.
MOST LIKELY GONNA GIVE HIM ANOTHER PASTING.
GOOD EVENING, COLONEL.
DO YOU MIND SITTING OVER HERE ?
I AM HAVING RATHER A LATE SUPPER.
ENGLISH CORNED BEEF.
NO, THANK YOU.
PRODUCE OF, UH, SCOTLAND.
I PREFER IT TO SAKE.
I SPENT THREE YEARS IN LONDON, YOU KNOW ?
I STUDIED AT THE LONDON POLYTECHNIC.
CHEERS.
LATER, PERHAPS ?
PERHAPS.
I WAS NOT A GOOD ARTIST.
MY FATHER DISAPPROVED.
HE FELT I BELONGED IN THE ARMY,
SO I CHANGED FROM ART TO ENGINEERING.
I MUST TELL YOU, COLONEL...
SAITO,
I INTEND TO MAKE A FULL REPORT OF YOUR ACTIVITIES IN THIS CAMP.
I DO NOT THINK YOU QUITE REALIZE MY POSITION.
I MUST CARRY OUT MY ORDERS.
OH, QUITE.
QUITE.
MY ORDERS ARE TO COMPLETE THE BRIDGE...
BY THE 12th DAY OF MAY.
TIME IS SHORT.
I HAVE ONLY 12 WEEKS MORE.
NO DOUBT.
THEREFORE, I AM COMPELLED TO USE ALL AVAILABLE PERSONNEL.
BUT NO OFFICERS, EXCEPT IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY.
BUT OFFICERS ARE WORKING ALONG THE ENTIRE RAILWAY !
YOU KNOW IT !
I KNOW IT !
BETTER NOT GET EXCITED.
WILL YOU HAVE A CIGAR ?
NO, THANK YOU.
WHEN I SAID ALL OFFICERS MUST WORK,
NATURALLY I NEVER MEANT YOU, THE COMMANDING OFFICER.
MY ORDERS WERE ONLY INTENDED FOR OFFICERS BELOW--
NONE OF MY OFFICERS WILL DO MANUAL LABOR.
PLEASE.
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY...
I HAVE BEEN THINKING THE MATTER OVER...
AND DECIDED TO PUT MAJORS AND ABOVE ON ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES,
LEAVING ONLY THE JUNIOR OFFICERS TO LEND A HAND.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME...
IF THE BRIDGE IS NOT READY IN TIME ?
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU ARE ME ?
I SUPPOSE, IF I WERE YOU,
CHEERS.
I WARN YOU, COLONEL,
IF I AM TO DIE, OTHERS WILL DIE BEFORE ME.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ?
MAJOR CLIPTON DID MENTION SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.
WELL ?
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
NOW, TELL ME, UH, COLONEL,
DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT AGREE THAT THE FIRST JOB OF AN OFFICER IS COMMAND ?
OF COURSE.
GOOD.
TAKE THIS BRIDGE OF YOURS.
AND TO BE FRANK, I HAVE GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER YOUR LIEUTENANT--
MIURA.
MIURA, HMM.
IS CAPABLE OF TACKLING A JOB OF SUCH IMPORTANCE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE OFFICERS-
WHO HAVE BUILT BRIDGES ALL OVER INDIA.
THE MEN RESPECT THEM.
IF HE LOSES IT, HE CEASES TO COMMAND.
AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN ?
DEMORALIZATION AND CHAOS.
AND A PRETTY POOR COMMANDER I WOULD BE IF I ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN TO MY MEN.
PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT AWARE...
THAT THE BRIDGE IS NOW UNDER MY PERSONAL COMMAND.
REALLY ?
AND MAY I ASK, ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE WORK ?
I AM NOT !
YOU PROVE MY POINT.
I HATE THE BRITISH !
YOU ARE STUBBORN, BUT HAVE NO PRIDE.
YOU ENDURE, BUT YOU HAVE NO COURAGE.
I HATE THE BRITISH !
POINTLESS GOING ON LIKE THIS.
STAY THERE !
STAND DOWN.
STAND DOWN !
BATTALION, ATTENTION !
BATTALION, STAND AT EASE !
PLEASE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DATE TODAY, COLONEL ?
OH, YES.
THROUGHOUT EAST ASIA, WE ARE CELEBRATING THIS DATE.
IN HONOR OF THIS OCCASION,
I HAVE GIVEN YOUR TROOPS A DAY OF REST.
MANY THANKS.
YOU AND YOUR OFFICERS MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.
AS PART OF THIS AMNESTY,
IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR OFFICERS TO DO MANUAL LABOR.
SOMEBODY DESERVES A MEDAL, SIR.
HMM.
HOW MANY MEN IN YOUR PARTY, CORPORAL ?
OH, SIR, 12 USUALLY,
BUT ONE OF THE MEN TOOK SICK VERY SUDDENLY THIS MORNING.
HE TOOK THREE OR MAYBE FOUR OF THE OTHERS TO HELP HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.
AND, UH, HE JUST TOOK TERRIBLE SICK, SIR.
A CORPORAL SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY MEN HE HAS UNDER HIM AT ALL TIMES.
OH, YES, SIR.
HAVE YOU A NERVOUS AFFLICTION ?
IF NOT, STOP MAKING THOSE FACES AT ONCE.
NO, SIR.
WE MUST PUT A STOP TO THESE DEMONSTRATIONS.
YES, SIR.
I SAY, REEVES.
YES, SIR.
HAVE YOU EVER CONSTRUCTED A BRIDGE ACROSS A STREAM LIKE THE KWAI ?
YES, SIR.
HALF A DOZEN OF THEM, IN MADRAS AND BENGAL.
IF THIS WERE YOUR BRIDGE,
HOW WOULD YOU GET IT UNDERWAY ?
GET IT UNDERWAY, SIR ?
OH ?
WHY NOT ?
AS I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU A WHILE AGO, SIR,
YOU SEE THOSE PILES ?
WHERE WOULD YOU BUILD IT ?
WHY, FURTHER DOWNSTREAM, SIR, ACROSS THOSE NARROWS.
HUGHES, IF THIS WERE YOUR BRIDGE, HOW WOULD YOU USE THE MEN ?
SOME OF THOSE PARTIES ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AGAINST EACH OTHER.
YES.
I TELL YOU, GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS.
THANKS TO THE JAPANESE, WE NOW COMMAND A RABBLE.
OUR TASK IS TO REBUILD THE BATTALION.
YES, SIR.
THE BRIDGE, SIR ?
THE BRIDGE.
WE CAN TEACH THESE BARBARIANS A LESSON IN WESTERN METHODS AND EFFICIENCY...
THAT WILL PUT THEM TO SHAME.
YES.
I SEE YOUR POINT, SIR.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.
YOU MEAN YOU REALLY WANT THEM TO BUILD A BRIDGE ?
I KNOW OUR MEN.
THAT WE WOULD, SIR.
NOW HERE AGAIN, I KNOW THE MEN.
RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, AND HUGHES AND I WILL ORGANIZE IT.
CAN WE MAKE A GO OF IT ?
FINE.
WE MUST DRAW UP OUR PLANS,
THEN ARRANGE A CONFERENCE WITH SAITO...
AND SET HIM STRAIGHT.
WELL, I THINK THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE PROCEDURAL MATTERS.
NOW-
WE FEEL THE POSITION OF THE BRIDGE WAS FIXED RATHER HASTILY...
AND, I HAVE TO ADD, INCORRECTLY.
INCORRECTLY ?
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.
MAJOR REEVES, OUR ENGINEER, HAS MADE A CAREFUL STUDY...
AND HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE RIVER BOTTOM THERE IS TOO SOFT.
TOO SOFT ?
MUD.
ALL THE WORK UP TO NOW HAS BEEN QUITE USELESS.
REEVES, WILL YOU CARRY ON ?
YES, SIR.
THAT BRIDGE WOULD COLLAPSE UNDER THE FIRST TRAIN TO CROSS IT.
PRESSURE AND SOIL RESISTANCE FIGURES IN TONS PER SQUARE INCH.
JUST A MOMENT, REEVES, BEFORE YOU GET TOO INVOLVED.
COLONEL, DO YOU SUPPOSE WE COULD HAVE A CUP OF TEA ?
WE BUILD A NEW BRIDGE AT THE SITE SELECTED BY MAJOR REEVES, 400 YARDS DOWNSTREAM.
ALTER ?
FROM A YARD AND A HALF OF EARTH MOVED TO TWO YARDS.
MAJOR HUGHES HAS THE FACTS AND FIGURES.
HUGHES, WILL YOU TAKE OVER ?
YES, SIR.
AS YOU CAN SEE AT A GLANCE, THE AVAILABLE FORCES HAVE BEEN BADLY DISTRIBUTED.
I STRONGLY URGE WE REVISE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WORKING PARTIES.
JUST A MOMENT.
YOU KNOW, COLONEL, IT WOULD SAVE CONSIDERABLE TIME...
IF WE COULD CARRY ON WORKING DURING DINNER.
DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A MEAL HERE ?
OF COURSE.
CARRY ON, HUGHES.
YES, SIR.
IF WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SQUADS AND SPECIALIZE THE FUNCTIONS OF EACH,
AND NOW, COL.
SAITO, I HAVE ONE MORE POINT.
AS MOST OF THE BRITISH SOLDIERS WILL BE WORKING ON THE BRIDGE,
ONLY A SMALL NUMBER WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR RAILWAY WORK.
I MUST ASK YOU TO LEND US SOME OF YOUR OWN MEN TO REINFORCE THE RAILWAY GANG...
SO THAT THE FINAL STRETCH OF TRACK CAN BE COMPLETED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE ORDER.
WELL,YOUMUSTFIX THEDAILYWORKQUOTA FORYOURMEN.
ITHOUGHTOF SETTINGIT ATA YARDANDAHALF , SOASNOTTOOVERTIRETHEM.
THAT WOULD ALSO CREATE A HEALTHY COMPETITIVE SPIRIT.
I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE ORDER.
YES, SIR.
I THINK THAT COMPLETES THE AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING.
IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO SAY THANK YOU, COL.
SAITO, FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,
AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ?
ONE QUESTION.
CAN YOU FINISH THE BRIDGE IN TIME ?
THROUGH AN UNFORTUNATE DISAGREEMENT, FOR WHICH I WAS NOT TO BLAME.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ?
NO.
THANK YOU.
THE MEETING IS CLOSED.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, CLIPTON.
GOOD NIGHT.
BY THE WAY, SIR, I MEANT TO TELL YOU.
THERE ARE TREES IN THIS FOREST VERY SIMILAR TO ELM.
AND THE ELM PILES OF LONDON BRIDGE LASTED 600 YEARS.
SIX HUNDRED YEARS, REEVES ?
YES,SIR.
SIX HUNDRED YEARS.
THAT WOULD BE QUITE SOMETHING.
OH, YES.
DOWN ON THE BEACH.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
KISS !
THEY GIVE ME POWDERS, PILLS, BATHS, INJECTIONS, ENEMAS,
WHEN ALL I NEED IS LOVE.
ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS LOVE.
KISS.
LOOK.
BRASSAHOY.
COMMANDER SHEARS ?
YES.
HOW DO YOU DO ?
SORRY TO INTRUDE--
LIKE A MARTINI ?
MIND IF I HAVE ONE ?
NO.
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET THAT ?
THIS IS A HOSPITAL, MAJOR.
YES, OF COURSE.
JOLLY GOOD.
LOOK.
I BELONG TO A RATHER RUM GROUP CALLED FORCE 316.
OUR HEADQUARTERS IS UP IN THE BOTANICAL GARDENS.
PROTECTING RARE PLANTS FROM THE ENEMY ?
NOT QUITE.
NO.
NO, THANKS.
AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THAT RAILWAY YOU WORKED ON,
AND YOU COULD GIVE US NO END OF VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION.
YES, BUT YOU COULD HELP US IN A RATHER SPECIAL SENSE.
BUT I WONDER IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY COME OUT AND SEE US.
LORD LOUIS WILL BE MOST GRATEFUL.
LORD WHO ?
OH, I SEE.
SHALL WE SAY THIS EVENING ABOUT 8:00 ?
THIS EVENING ?
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
WELL, TOMORROW MORNING THEN ABOUT 10:00.
OKAY, 10:00.
OH, THANKS VERY MUCH.
CHEERIO.
CHEERIO.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
I KNOW.
HUT !
MAY I SEE YOUR PASS, SIR, PLEASE ?
OH, YES.
THANK YOU, SIR.
CARRY ON, DRIVER.
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.
GOOD SHOW.
COME ALONG, THOMPSON.
USE YOUR KNIFE, MAN !
USE YOUR KNIFE !
ON YOUR FEET, CHAP.
TO THE DEBRIEFING ROOM QUICKLY.
COME ON.
MOVE YOURSELF.
MOVE !
MOVE QUICKLY !
VERY CLUMSY, JOYCE.
VERY CLUMSY !
ALWAYS USE YOUR KNIFE IMMEDIATELY, JOYCE !
IMMEDIATELY, MAN !
YOU SEE ?
WAIT A MINUTE !
SO AM I, SIR.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ENEMY, SIR.
THAT WILL BE ALL, JOYCE.
YES, SIR.
SORRY, SIR.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, SIR ?
WELL, I WAS ON MY WAY TO SEE MAJOR WARDEN.
HE SHOULD BE FINISHING HIS LECTURE AT ANY MOMENT.
THUNDEROUS OVATION.
THE MAJOR BELIEVES IN KEEPING OUR TRAINING AS CLOSE TO REAL LIFE AS POSSIBLE, SIR.
MAJOR WARDEN, SIR.
YES ?
VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME ALONG.
OH, THEY CERTAINLY HAVE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
WELL, COME ALONG THEN.
COLONEL GREEN IS LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.
OH ?
UTTERLY CHARMING.
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE, MAJOR ?
SABOTAGE, DEMOLITION.
THAT LINE OF COUNTRY.
WONDERFUL STUFF.
THAT LAST LITTLE POP WAS MADE WITH A LUMP HALF THE SIZE OF THIS.
HERE.
OH !
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.
SEE ?
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH IT.
THIS IS MY PLACE.
GO AHEAD.
WOULD YOU CARE FOR ONE ?
NO, THANKS.
A DRINK ?
NO, THANK YOU.
SPOT OF TEA FOR ONE, PLEASE, PETER.
VERY WELL, SIR.
YOU READ THIS ?
OH, I TAUGHT ORIENTAL LANGUAGES AT CAMBRIDGE BEFORE THE WAR.
BY THE WAY, I NEVER CONGRATULATED YOU ON YOUR ESCAPE.
IT WAS A GOOD SHOW, I MUST SAY.
I WAS LUCKY.
NO, I SUPPOSE NOT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHERE YOU WERE ?
ALL RIGHT.
BUT WE THINK THE CAMP IS ABOUT HERE.
DO YOUR PEOPLE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT COL.
NICHOLSON ?
NO.
HE HAD THE GUTS OF A MANIAC.
HERE IS THE RIVER KWAI, AND HERE IS THE SIAMESE VILLAGE WHERE YOU WERE HELPED.
AND HERE IS THE RAILWAY.
BUT THEN, YOU MUST BE FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL THIS AREA.
OH, NOT REALLY.
I WAS OUT OF MY HEAD HALF THE TIME.
NOW, THE RAILWAY STARTS DOWN HERE IN SINGAPORE.
MALAYA, BANGKOK, RANGOON.
THEIR IDEA IS TO DRIVE ON THROUGH INTO INDIA.
HMM.
WHERE WAS I PICKED UP ?
OH, UM, ABOUT HERE.
AS YOU KNOW, THE JAPANESE AIM TO OPEN THE BANGKOK/RANGOON SECTION BY THE MIDDLE OF MAY.
SO WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN AND SMASH IT UP ON THE GROUND.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET THERE ?
PARACHUTE DROP AND THEN MARCH.
WITH DEMOLITION EQUIPMENT THROUGH THAT JUNGLE ?
YES.
OUR CHIEF PROBLEM IS LACK OF FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE.
YOU SEE, NONE OF US HAVE EVER BEEN THERE.
COLONEL GREEN HAS GIVEN ME THE KWAI BRIDGE.
LUCKY YOU.
NO, THANKS.
SO IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS-- YES, OF COURSE.
I AM SORRY.
WELL, THERE IS ONLY ONE QUESTION, ACTUALLY.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING BACK ?
COME AGAIN.
BUT YOU DO HAVE A UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE FOR OUR PURPOSE...
TO ASK ME THIS ?
WELL, FRANKLY, YES.
MAJOR, I JUST GOT OUT OF THERE.
MY ESCAPE WAS A MIRACLE.
EVEN YOUR PEOPLE SAID SO.
NOW YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK ?
THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING.
I BELONG TO THE AMERICAN NAVY.
OF COURSE.
ACTUALLY, COL.
GREEN HAS ALREADY TAKEN THE MATTER UP WITH YOUR PEOPLE.
WITH MY PEOPLE ?
A SIGNAL ARRIVED YESTERDAY MORNING FROM YOUR C IN C PACIFIC...
AUTHORIZING YOUR TEMPORARY TRANSFER OF DUTY TO FORCE 316.
IT WAS AWFULLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW TO BREAK IT TO YOU.
I MEAN IT.
YOUR WHO ?
OH ?
OH.
WHEN THE HOUSTON SUNK, I MADE IT ASHORE WITH AN OFFICER-- A REAL COMMANDER.
LATER ON, WE RAN INTO A JAPANESE PATROL AND HE WAS KILLED.
I FIGURED IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I WAS CAPTURED, SO--
SO YOU CHANGED UNIFORMS WITH A DEAD MAN.
I THOUGHT OFFICERS WOULD GET BETTER TREATMENT IN PRISON CAMPS.
NOT THAT IT DID ME ANY GOOD.
I KIND OF GOT USED TO BEING A COMMANDER,
AND SO, WHEN I ARRIVED HERE AT THE HOSPITAL,
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,
YES, I SAW ONE OF THEM ON THE BEACH.
YOU WANT AN OFFICER FOR YOUR TEAM.
MADE.
YES, OF COURSE.
BECAUSE I WENT OFF MY ROCKER IN THE JUNGLE.
WHEN MY NAVY FINDS OUT WHO I AM,
IT TOOK A BIT OF DOING.
BUT FINALLY C IN C PACIFIC SENT US A COPY OF YOUR SERVICE RECORD.
THE PHOTOGRAPH, THE FINGERPRINTS, EVERYTHING.
FOR MAKING AN ESCAPE FROM THE JUNGLE.
AND GIVE YOU TO THE NAVY CROSS FOR IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER.
YOU SEE ?
HOT POTATO.
AS FAR AS YOUR PRESENT RANK IS CONCERNED,
A SIMULATED MAJOR.
THAT FIGURES.
WELL.
GOOD SHOW.
OH, COL.
GREEN, SIR.
THIS IS MAJOR SHEARS.
REALLY ?
GOOD SHOW.
JOLLY GOOD SHOW, MAJOR.
GET UP TO SICK BAY, BAKER.
GET CRACKING.
WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THE OLD MAN WANTS US TO BUILD A PROPER BRIDGE ?
HELLO, CLIPTON.
FINE JOB OUR CHAPS ARE DOING.
REALLY FIRST RATE.
YES.
THANKS, REEVES.
RIGHT, SIR.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
SIR, ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT BUILDING THIS BRIDGE IS A GOOD IDEA ?
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?
YES, SIR.
A GOOD IDEA ?
THAT DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN RESTORED,
THAT THEIR CONDITION HAS BEEN IMPROVED ?
YES, SIR, BUT--
THEY FEEL BETTER, AND THEY ARE NO LONGER ABUSED OR MALTREATED.
WELL, THEN.
FORGIVE ME, SIR-- COLLABORATION WITH THE ENEMY.
PERHAPS EVEN AS TREASONABLE ACTIVITY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, CLIPTON ?
WE ARE PRISONERS OF WAR.
I UNDERSTAND THAT, SIR, BUT MUST WE WORK SO WELL ?
MUST WE BUILD THEM A BETTER BRIDGE THAN THEY COULD HAVE BUILT FOR THEMSELVES ?
IF YOU HAD TO OPERATE ON SAITO, WOULD YOU DO YOUR BEST OR LET HIM DIE ?
WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE THIS BATTALION DISINTEGRATE IN IDLENESS ?
TAKE A GOOD LOOK, CLIPTON.
ONEDAY, THEWARWILLBEOVER ,
ANDI HOPETHATTHE PEOPLE WHOUSETHISBRIDGE INYEARSTO COME...
WILL REMEMBER HOW IT WAS BUILT AND WHO BUILT IT.
NOT A GANG OF SLAVES, BUT SOLDIERS--
BRITISH SOLDIERS, CLIPTON, EVEN IN CAPTIVITY.
YES, SIR.
HOLD IT !
HOLD IT !
USE YOUR BOOT !
GET YOUR BOOT IN THERE !
REALLY GOOD.
GOOD MORNING.
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU PEOPLE STARING AT ?
GET ON WITH YOUR JOBS !
NOW GET HIM WITH YOUR BOOT !
FOUR MINUTES LATE TO BE EXACT.
YOU WERE IN NEED OF MEDICAL ATTENTION ?
SIR ?
I WAS REFERRING TO THE NURSE.
OH.
OH, YES.
VERY INGENIOUS.
WARDEN WAS RIGHT.
SIT DOWN.
THE REASON I ASKED YOU HERE WAS TO HELP US PICK THE FOURTH MEMBER OF YOUR TEAM.
ASK MR. JOYCE TO COME IN.
SIR.
CHAPMAN HERE WANTS JOYCE, BUT I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT HIM.
I THINK HE HAS TOO MUCH IMAGINATION AS DISTINCT FROM COLD CALCULATION.
ALL RIGHT.
AT EASE.
THESE GENTLEMEN ARE THINKING OF TAKING YOU FOR A LITTLE HIKE INTO THE JUNGLE.
YES, SIR.
YOU WERE AN ACCOUNTANT IN MONTREAL.
YES, SIR.
NOT REALLY AN ACCOUNTANT, SIR.
YEAH ?
EXACTLY WHAT DID YOU DO THEN ?
WELL, SIR, I JUST CHECKED COLUMNS AND COLUMNS OF FIGURES...
WHICH THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAD CHECKED BEFORE ME.
AND THEN THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO CHECKED THEM AFTER I HAD CHECKED THEM.
HOW DID YOU WIND UP HERE ?
AND ABOUT TWO YEARS LATER, I VOLUNTEERED FOR THIS WORK.
YOU VOLUNTEERED ?
YES, SIR.
YOU SEE, THE REGULAR ARMY--
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN BE FRANK.
WELL, SIR, THE REGULAR ARMY SORT OF REMINDED ME OF MY JOB IN CIVILIAN LIFE.
THINK ABOUT THIS.
COULD YOU USE IT IN COLD BLOOD ?
COULD YOU KILL WITHOUT HESITATION ?
WHAT WAS THE ANSWER ?
THANK YOU, JOYCE.
NOW, YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN.
WELL, AT LEAST HE WAS HONEST ABOUT IT, SIR.
NONE OF US KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION UNTIL THE MOMENT ARISES.
IF HE WANTS TO GO THAT BAD, HE CAN EVEN TAKE MY PLACE.
NOW THEN.
I HAVE A REPORT FROM AIR RECONNAISSANCE ON THAT VILLAGE.
NO, SIR.
BLAST.
THIS IS AWKWARD.
SILLY, IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME.
WELL, IN THAT CASE--
ALL RIGHT, CHAPMAN.
YOU CAN RUN ALONG.
YES, SIR.
WELL, THEN.
FEEL LIKE A SNIFF OF AIR ?
YES, SIR.
YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA, YOUR MAKING FRIENDS IN THAT VILLAGE.
THE NEW L PILL.
INSTANTANEOUS, PAINLESS.
MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES.
FOR CAPTURE, OF COURSE.
IF ANY OF YOU GET HURT OR WOUNDED ON THE TREK,
THE OTHERS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND.
THE OBJECTIVE COMES FIRST IN OUR WORK.
COLONEL, YOU WANT MY HONEST EVALUATION OF THIS TEAM ?
I UNDERSTAND.
GO AHEAD.
WELL, CHAPMAN WILL BE FINE-- ICE WATER IN HIS VEINS.
HUH ?
WHY NOT ?
CAMBRIDGE DON AND ALL OF THAT.
FOR HIM TO PLAY AROUND WITH EXPLOSIVES LIKE A KID WITH FIRECRACKERS, BUT--
WHEN WE LOST SINGAPORE, HE STAYED BEHIND AND BLEW UP A COUPLE OF BRIDGES,
CAUGHT HIM ?
YES, FASCINATING STORY.
NO ?
THEY SAY IF YOU MAKE ONE JUMP,
THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THE MOST SENSIBLE THING FOR MAJOR SHEARS TO DO...
IS TO GO AHEAD AND JUMP AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
WITH OR WITHOUT PARACHUTE ?
OH, VERY GOOD, OLD MAN.
THERE ARE TOO MANY JAPANESE PATROLS NOW.
YAI HIMSELF.
HE HATES THE JAPANESE.
WHICH MEANS WE SHALL HAVE TO USE WOMEN BEARERS.
WOMEN BEARERS.
SO WE SHALL HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE JUNGLE.
WHAT ABOUT CHAPMAN, SIR ?
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG ?
I WAS JUST THINKING.
BY A ROUTE I NEVER TOOK.
TELL THAT TO CHAPMAN.
BE HAPPY IN YOUR WORK.
YES, SIR.
LEECHES.
LEECHES.
SHE WANTS TO TAKE THE LEECHES OFF YOUR BACK.
NO.
THAT WOULD SPOIL IT.
TOO MUCH TALK ALWAYS SPOILS IT.
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS ROTTEN JUNGLE.
THIS IS YOUR FRIENDLIEST ENEMY,
REMINDING YOU TO TAKE IT EASY...
AND NEVER VOLUNTEER FOR ANYTHING.
RIGHT.
READ IT.
ORIGINAL BRIDGE WORKS REPORTED ABANDONED.
ENEMY INTENDS TO OPEN RAILWAY...
YOU SHOULD SYNCHRONIZE DEMOLITION WITH PASSAGE THIS TRAIN.
GOOD HUNTING.
A TRAIN AND A BRIDGE.
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.
YES, SIR.
THAT WOULD REALLY BE A SHOW.
CAN WE GET THERE IN TIME, SIR ?
IF WE SET A FASTER PACE, WE COULD MAKE IT BEFORE SUNDOWN ON THE 12th.
OH, BY ALL MEANS.
GOOD HUNTING.
GOOD SHOW.
JOLLY GOOD FUN.
JOLLY, JOLLY GOOD.
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HEAVE !
HALF A PINT, SIR.
QUININE.
CLIPTON, WE ARE FACING A CRISIS.
YES, SIR ?
OH.
THE OFFICERS ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE BRIDGE ?
THIS IS OUR SHOW.
WE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF OUR OWN RESOURCES.
NO REFLECTION ON YOU.
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS A FEW MALINGERERS.
BE HONEST.
KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
COME ALONG.
HIS TEMPERATURE WAS 104 LAST NIGHT.
RIGHT, I SEE.
AND THIS MAN ?
LEG ULCERS.
I MAY SAVE THE LEG IF I DO SOME MORE CUTTING TONIGHT.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SEND HIM OUT TO WORK, SIR ?
AND THAT MAN THERE ?
YES, BUT I WONDER IN A CASE LIKE HIS...
LIGHT DUTIES ?
TO KEEP A MAN IN HOSPITAL JUST BECAUSE HE SCRATCHED HIS ARM, IS IT ?
NOT OUR POLICY ?
WELL, IS IT ?
A MAN MAY NOT BE ON TOP OF HIS FORM,
BUT HE CAN STILL MAKE HIMSELF USEFUL.
TRIMMINGS AND FINISHING JOBS.
STAND EASY, BAKER.
TELL ME, DO YOU FEEL UP TO DOING A LITTLE LIGHT WORK ON THE BRIDGE ?
ANYTHING YOU SAY, SIR.
GOOD SHOW.
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?
NOTHING DIFFICULT.
GOOD MAN.
LOOK HERE, MEN.
BUT WE ARE FACING A CRISIS.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO FEEL UP TO IT, HOW ABOUT LENDING THE OTHERS A HAND, EH ?
FETCH AND CARRY.
A SPOT OF PAINT HERE AND THERE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
YES, SIR.
GOOD SHOW.
COME ON, FOLLOW ME.
TEN MINUTES.
COME ON, JOYCE.
GO THAT WAY, JOYCE.
I COULD HAVE DONE IT.
I WAS READY.
ARE YOU HIT, SIR ?
OH, SHUT UP, JOYCE.
I CAN WALK ON IT.
YEAH, BUT HOW FAR AND HOW FAST ?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
WE ALL NEED IT.
MAYBE SIX.
COME ON.
YEAH.
IF YOU STOP, WE STOP.
OR WHETHER WE COULD FIND YOU IF WE DID.
YOU MAKE ME SICK WITH YOUR HEROICS.
THIS IS JUST A GAME, THIS WAR.
YOU AND THAT COL.
CRAZY WITH COURAGE !
FOR WHAT ?
HOW TO DIE LIKE A GENTLEMAN.
HOW TO DIE BY THE RULES.
WHEN THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING IS HOW TO LIVE LIKE A HUMAN BEING !
IF WE GO ON, WE GO ON TOGETHER.
COME ON.
STILL SORRY WE BROUGHT YOU ALONG ?
FEELING BETTER ?
YEAH.
THANK YOU, MAJOR.
NOT LIKE THE TEMPORARY BRIDGES THE ENEMY USUALLY THROWS TOGETHER.
LOOK.
THOSE POOR DEVILS DOWN THERE.
IMAGINE BEING FORCED TO BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE CONDITION THEY MUST BE IN.
THEJAPANESESEEMTOBE ENJOYINGITTOO.
IF HE KNEW WE WERE HERE, IT MIGHT BOOST HIS MORALE A LITTLE.
ABOUT THREE FEET UNDER THE WATER, I SHOULD THINK,
AND RUN THE MAIN WIRE DOWNSTREAM TO THE PLUNGER.
THE PROBLEM IS WHERE TO HIDE IT.
YEAH, OUR SIDE OF THE RIVER IS QUITE OBVIOUSLY USED BY THE JAPANESE.
LOOK.
YOU SEE THOSE FALLEN TREE TRUNKS...
AND THE GRAY ROCK JUST BELOW THEM ON THAT LITTLE BEACH ?
YES, SIR, I SEE THEM.
AS SOON AS THE BRIDGE GOES UP...
SIR, I WAS THE BEST SWIMMER IN MY COURSE.
YEAH.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LINE OF COUNTRY.
THANK YOU, SIR.
RIGHT.
YAI WILL BE WITH YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OCCUPY THE NIPS IF THEY MAKE TROUBLE FOR JOYCE.
PERHAPS I MIGHT EVEN TAKE A FEW POTSHOTS AT THE TRAIN.
ALL CLEAR ?
ANY QUESTIONS ?
RIGHT.
WHICH MEANS BUILDING A RAFT.
YAI WILL TAKE THREE WOMEN TO HELP YOU BUILD THE RAFT.
ONE WILL STAY HERE WITH ME.
ALL RIGHT, NOW GET CRACKING.
SHEARS...
I KNOW.
I THINK SO.
WANT ME TO HANDLE IT ?
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THANKS.
LOAD.
BEAUTIFUL.
YES, BEAUTIFUL.
A FIRST-RATE JOB.
I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD TURN OUT SO WELL.
YES, A BEAUTIFUL CREATION.
TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS IN PEACE AND WAR.
I LOVE INDIA.
BUT THERE ARE TIMES...
AND YOU WONDER,
YOU ASK YOURSELF...
WHAT THE SUM TOTAL OF YOUR LIFE REPRESENTS,
WHAT DIFFERENCE YOUR BEING THERE AT ANY TIME MADE TO ANYTHING...
OR IF IT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL, REALLY.
BUT TONIGHT, TONIGHT--
BLAST.
I MUST BE OFF.
THE MEN ARE PREPARING SOME SORT OF ENTERTAINMENT.
LOVELY.

AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF YOU MOVE ON TOMORROW TO A NEW CAMP AND NEW CONSTRUCTION.
HOWEVER, YOU WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW THAT THE COMPLETION OF THIS LINK IN THE RAILWAY...
WILL ENABLE US TO TRANSPORT THE SICK AND THE DISABLED...
TO THE NEW CAMP BY TRAIN.
COL.
SAITO HAS KINDLY PERMITTED ME TO STAY BEHIND...
WITH MAJOR CLIPTON AND THE SICK MEN,
NOW THAT YOUR WORK HERE IS FINISHED,
I SUPPOSE MANY OF YOU FEEL SOMEWHAT LET DOWN.
BUT ONE DAY-- IN A WEEK, A MONTH, A YEAR,
OR THAT DAY WHEN, GOD WILLING, WE ALL RETURN TO OUR HOMES AGAIN--

YOU GOT EVERYTHING ?
STAND, AMMUNITION, PACK, CANTEEN, KNIFE ?
YES.
EXCEPT TO WISH YOU A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE.
THANK YOU.
YOU CAN SEE THE WIRE.
THE CHARGES.
DO IT NOW !
THE TRAIN SHOULD BE ALONG IN FIVE OR TEN MINUTES.
WHY ?
AS YOU PLEASE.
GOOD MORNING.
WHAT IS HE DOING ?
OUR OWN MAN !
I WAS RIGHT.
THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON.
COL.
SAITO, HAVE YOU A KNIFE ?
MINED ?
GOOD BOY.
OFFICER, SIR.
BRITISH OFFICER, HERE TO BLOW UP THE BRIDGE.
BLOW UP THE BRIDGE ?
YES, SIR.
BRITISH COMMANDO ORDERS, SIR.
BLOW UP THE BRIDGE ?
LOOK OUT !
NO !
NO !
HELP !
HELP !
KILL HIM !
KILL HIM !
LET ME GO, SIR !
KILL HIM !
KILL HIM !
HELP!
KILL HIM !
WHAT HAVE I DONE ?
MADNESS.
I HAD TO DO IT.
I HAD TO DO IT !
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAPTURED ALIVE !
IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO.
MADNESS.
MADNESS !
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that english kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is NichoIson.
I am colonel Saito.
In the name of His imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
battalion, stand at ease.
fall out, Major Hughes.
battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
mostly Aussies.
Some Iime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has CIipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
AII right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps col.
NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears--
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
But may I add another word?
please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the Iaw, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
english prisoners!
Notice I do not say english soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
AII men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, colonel Saito to article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read english, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absoIved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
AII enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
battalion, take up tools.
Move to the Ieft in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, colonel....
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I couId have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I couId have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
also two others, corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, CIipton, I understand.
truly.
No.
principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
well?
should a tragedy occur, it wouId be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
battalion, attention.
english prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
AII work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
english corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London PoIytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers beIow--
No officers will do manual labour.
please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
CIipton did mention that.
please sit down.
Now.
tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
DemoraIization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
battalion, attention!
battalion, stand at ease.
please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
incorrectly?
unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
AII the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
colonel, it wouId save time if we could work during dinner.
would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
AII I need is love.
AII you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is in the botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
general salute!
general salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
well, come along, then.
col.
Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you Iike with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
would you Iike to see where you were?
AII right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to col.
NichoIson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
MaIaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
col.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
ridiculous!
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
actually, col.
Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
well....
Good show!
Oh, colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
really?
Good show!
jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
hello, CIipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no Ionger abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, CIipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
hold him!
hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
AII right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
exactly what did you do?
well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
could you use it in cold blood?
could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
well, at Ieast he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
blast!
This is awkward.
silly, it never occurred to me!
well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
tell that to Chapman.
lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
jolly good fun.
jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I couId have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
explosives and L-piIIs go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that colonel NichoIson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
AII right.
Come on.
still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
AII clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
AII right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it wouId turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I Iove India.
But there are times....
suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a Iong and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
help!
kill him!
kill him!
Let me go, sir!
kill him!
kill him!
kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu... how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
I want you to keep this lighter.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson... serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 16... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention... and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites...
Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape... to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I...
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you... better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914... when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question... why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure... of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
I suppose if I were you...
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel... if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now...
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant...
Is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance... who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge... how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now...
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily... and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site... and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we...
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As most of the British will work on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya...
Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your CINC Pacific... authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
I kind of got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your CINC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new I pill.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train...
Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you... but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties... might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Now, look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it... how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and I pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules... when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times... when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow... to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness... you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 1 6 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it. I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes. I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape. lt was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new L pill.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 1 04.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it. I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new L pill.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Now, look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. NichoIson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears--
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel....
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
No officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
it was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times....
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Finish work.
Hurry!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.
No time for jokes.
Finish work.
Dig!
How about putting us on the sick list?
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart... like you gave me that this morning, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on the sick list.
Him too.
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.
Then what?
Here lies--
Ah, yes.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Battalion, halt.
End of the line.
Left turn!
Stand at ease.
Stand easy.
Well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...
I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp 1 6... along the great railroad... which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen... to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill... and officers will work as well as men.
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard... you will be punished!
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire... no stockade... no watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor... is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention with me... and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.
That will not be necessary.
Attention.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.
The U.S. Navy out here?
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
What happened to them?
They died... of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork... bullet wounds, snake bites...
Saito... and then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton looked at you?
Just about to, sir.
Commander, you can finish that shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
You could call it that.
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-
I think he understands the situation now.
I must be pushing on.
Get me a list of your requirements.
Yes, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in a hundred of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
There are your real odds.
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it... is like accepting a death sentence.
I understand how you feel.
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters.
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.
Here there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
Remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us... and not by thejapanese.
Are you with me, Commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.
Queer bird, even for an American.
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
Attention!
English prisoners!
From the moment you surrendered... you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge... by the 1 2th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer...
Lieutenant Mioura.
Time is short.
All men will work!
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just... for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you...
It is they who brought you here, not I!
Therefore... they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito... to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
You read English, I take it?
The code specifically states that the--
Stand fast in the ranks!
Stand fast in the ranks!
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world... we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work!
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.
Now you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
I will count three.
If by the third count... you and your officers are not on the way to work...
I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
Excuse me, sir.
Really it is.
What about him?
He only suggested--
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
As so say all of us
Hurray!
Timber!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death... they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot... the third drowned!
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
Here is reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today... and this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules!
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Your colonel is mad.
Quite mad.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Tell him that if his officers will not work...
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir?
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And LieutenantJennings is dead.
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Here is where we must win through.
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
What does that mean?
It means only one thing:
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible, not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention!
English prisoners... let us ask the question...
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret...
I admit to you the failure of a member of thejapanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future...
I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismiss.
Battalion, dismissed.
Take a look at this!
Red Cross?
Tomorrow we begin again.
Harry, look.
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, Colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to saki.
I spent three years in London.
I spent three years in London.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army... so I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.
I only have 1 2 weeks.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it!
I know it!
When I said all officers must work... naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labor.
Please.
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over... and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties... leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you are me?
I suppose if I were you...
Cheers.
I warn you, Colonel.
If I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, Colonel... do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Take this bridge of yours.
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes... have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.
Perhaps you are not aware... that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated, but you have no shame.
You are stubborn, but have no pride.
You endure, but you have no courage.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease!
Please.
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion...
I have given your troops a day of rest.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty... it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party, Corporal?
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning... and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.
Yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?
Get it underway, sir?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
no teamwork.
Some parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to thejapanese, we now command a rabble.
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.
Yes, I see your point, sir.
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?
I know our men.
But it will be a proper bridge.
Here again, I know the men.
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.
Fine.
We must draw up our plans... then arrange a conference with Saito... and set him straight.
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now-
The next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned.
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily... and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, yes.
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site... and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.
Mud.
All the work up to now has been quite useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?
Yes, sir.
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
Carry on, Hughes.
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge... only a small number will be available for railway work.
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men... to reinforce the railway gang... so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
That completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
Good night.
Good night.
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you... there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
That would be something.
Good morning.
Down on the beach.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas... when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Just call me sir.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
Like a martini?
Of course.Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
Not quite.
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of very valuable information.
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00?
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then, about 1 0:00?
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I know.
Carry on, driver.
All right.
Thanks.
Good show,Jenkins!
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly.
Move!
Very clumsy,Joyce.
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.
You see?
Wait a minute.
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.
Sorry, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
He should be finishing his lecture at any moment now.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?
Come along then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Utterly charming.
It has such a melodramatic air.
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had the guts of a maniac.
Here is the River Kwai...
Here is the River Kwai... and here is the Siamese village where you were helped... and here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through into India.
Where was I picked up?
About here.
As you know, thejapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
None of us have ever been there.
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.
Lucky you.
I am sorry.
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?
Frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.
I figured I would be captured, so--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
I got used to being a commander... so when I arrived here at the hospital...
There were certain definite advantages.
Yes, I saw one on the beach.
Is this your photograph?
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:
the photograph, fingerprints.
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?
A simulated major.
That figures.
Good show.
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.
Really?
Good show.
Jolly good show, Major.
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.
Are you all right?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look.
One day the war will be over.
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
Hold it!
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.
Good morning.
What on Earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Get him with your boot!
You were in need of medical attention?
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
Now, the main reason I asked you here today... was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do then?
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures... which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
Sounds a frightful bore.
Sir, it was a frightful bore.
How did you wind up here?
You see, the regular army--
Go ahead.
You can be frank.
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
What was the answer?
Thank you,Joyce.
Now you see what I mean?
At least he was honest about it, sir.
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek... the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand.
Go ahead.
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is-
Cambridge don and all that.
Fascinating story.
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do... is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Very good, old man.
There are too many Japanese patrols now.
He hates thejapanese.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Go ahead.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
She wants to take the leeches off you.
That would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
You might as well dump it.
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy... reminding you to take it easy... and never volunteer for anything.
Read it.
Original bridge works reported abandoned.
New construction downstream from first site.
Enemy intends to open railway... with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P... estimated to arrive target morning 1 3th.
You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Good hunting.
A train and a bridge would be something.
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.
By all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Heave!
The officers are working on the bridge?
Yes.
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.
I came to talk to you about the sick list.
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Come along.
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties... might do him more good than being cooped up here.
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful... trimming and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand?
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.
What do you say?
Follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on,Joyce.
Go that way.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry it in your pack like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This war is just a game.
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.
Crazy with courage!
For what?
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, Major.
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build something like that... in the condition they must be in.
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by thejapanese.
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks... and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?
Yes, sir, I see them.
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips... if they make any trouble forJoyce.
I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Right.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
You wonder... you ask yourself... what the sum total of your life represents... what difference your being there at any time made to anything... or if it made any difference at all really.
But tonight--
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A garden of Eden
Just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished...
Now that your work here is finished...
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be... and I think will be... an example to all our countrymen... soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That and more... here in the wilderness.
You have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
The King.
You got everything?
Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?
Yes.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges.
Do it now.
Why?
As you please.
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.
Good morning.
Our own man.
I was right.
There is something going on.
You have to do it, boy.
You have to do it now!
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined.
Good boy.
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders, sir.
Look out.
Help!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir.
Kill him!
You?
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favor.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
You go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies...
I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Ah, yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number zero-one-two- three-four-five-six-seven.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
You going to tell him the truth?
Of course not.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
How do you do, sir?
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime...
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to.
Come over here, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labor?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Shears...
Lt. Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
But may I add another word?
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
Interesting point, sir.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.
Here, there is no civilization.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri...
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonor.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labor.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that...
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of Code?
Of bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labor.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel...
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
Many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir...
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
Not so good.
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail!
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
Time!
Here is where we must win through.
Doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look!
Most likely going to give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers!
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities.
I do not think you quite realize my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
No officers, except for administration.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below...
No officers will do manual labor.
Please!
I was about to say:
No.
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand?
Clipton did mention that.
Please sit down.
Now.
Tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now.
Take this bridge of yours.
Miura.
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please...
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honor of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And...
He took terrible sick, sir.
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal...
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
Uncoordinated activity.
No teamwork.
Some parties are working against each other.
Yes.
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.
Fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Show what a British soldier is capable of.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
That takes care of all the procedural matters.
Oh, yes.
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud!
All the work has been useless.
It would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.
From 1.5 yards of earth moved to two.
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have dinner?
Of course.
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point...
As the British will work on the bridge only a few will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
Are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees here similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...
All I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants you.
Like a martini?
I think not.
Mind if I have one?
How did you get that?
Yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
If you want to go over the whole thing again.
Very kind.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Thanks for telling me.
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
Good show!
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the railway.
You must be fairly familiar with this area.
No, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back!
Ridiculous!
This is embarrassing...
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was hard to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time till I...
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Made!
Finally your C-in-C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
You see?
Hot potato.
A simulated major.
That figures.
Well...
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay.
Get cracking!
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Yes.
What do you think?
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even treason.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we do better than they could themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning!
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get him with your boot!
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you wind up here?
Later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular Army...
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.
If he wants to go, he can take my place!
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.
Blast!
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me!
Well, maybe...
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
Instant, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is...
Why not?
Cambridge don and all of that.
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He...
Two jumps, 80%.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work!
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly good.
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are working?
Why not ask Saito for some men?
This is ours.
The sick list.
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.
Want to send him out to work?
That man there?
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
You?
Nothing difficult.
Look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Your heroics make me sick.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L-pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
All right.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips if they make trouble for Joyce.
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you.
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes, a beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times...
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder...
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight...
Tonight...
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
If you were the only
Girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter
In the world today
We could go on loving
In the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honor.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Have you a knife?
I just realized the bridge has been mined!
Mined!
Good boy!
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
!
No, no!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, Joyce!
You!
You!
What have I done?
Madness!
I had to do it!
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!
It was the only thing to do!
Madness!
Madness!
Subtitles by Gelula/SDI/SAR
Finish work!
Go to hut.
Yeah, that figures.
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.
No time for jokes.
Finish work!
Dig, dig.
How about putting us on sick list?
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.
You no sick.
You never sick.
Why you always play sick to me, Shears?
Captain Kanematsu how about a butt?
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.
I want to return the favour.
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.
Think I stole it?
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.
You funny man, Shears.
Okay, you go on sick list.
Him too.
Far away.
Here lies....
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.
Thomson.
Yes.
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson serial number 01234567.
No need to mock the grave.
May he rest in peace.
He found little enough of it while he was alive.
Mark time!
Halt.
Into line, left turn.
Stand easy.
Well done, well done.
My name is Nicholson.
I am Colonel Saito.
In the name of His Imperial Majesty I welcome you.
I am the commanding officer of this camp which is Camp 16 along the great railroad which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.
You British prisoners have been chosen to build a bridge across the River Kwai.
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.
And officers will work as well as men.
The Japanese army cannot have idle mouths to feed.
If you work hard, you will be treated well.
But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
A word to you about escape.
There is no barbed wire.
No stockade.
No watchtower.
They are not necessary.
We are an island in the jungle.
Escape is impossible.
You would die.
Today you rest.
Be happy in your work.
Dismissed.
Battalion, stand at ease.
Fall out, Major Hughes.
Battalion, stand easy.
Get the men to their quarters.
Colonel!
I heard your remarks just now, sir.
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
Is that so?
I have a copy of the Convention and would be glad to let you glance through it.
That will not be necessary.
Sit down, please.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.
We found him and an Australian.
U.S. Navy?
Out here?
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
And your group here?
Mostly Aussies.
Some lime--
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.
And what happened to them?
They died of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.
Other causes of death:
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites Saito.
Then there were some who just got tired of living.
Has Clipton seen you?
Just about to, sir.
Come over here, commander, you can shave later.
All right.
Besides, this is working kit.
The officers in your party did manual labour?
I think you could call it that.
Saito.
Yes.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
Well, I must be pushing on.
Anything we can do.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Go on, say it.
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.
Any other points?
About the escape committee.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.
Where?
Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.
Please.
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
To give up hope of escape to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence.
Waiting for the right moment, the right company.
I understand how you feel.
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point of which you are unaware.
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.
Ordered, mind you.
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?
Without law, commander, there is no civilisation.
Here, there is no civilisation.
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.
Is there anything else?
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.
And remember this:
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us and not by the Japanese.
Are you with me there, commander?
Well, I....
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.
A living slave.
Queer bird.
Even for an Ameri--
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.
English prisoners!
Notice I do not say English soldiers.
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
You will finish the bridge by the 12th day of May.
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.
Time is short.
All men will work.
Your officers will work beside you.
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
Your shame is their dishonour.
It is they who told you better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.
It is they who brought you here, not I.
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.
That is all.
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.
Bradley, back in your place.
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.
Give me the book.
By all means.
You read English, I take it?
You see, the Code states that--
Stand fast in the ranks.
You speak to me of code?
What code?
Of Bushido?
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.
My officers will not do manual labour.
We shall see.
All enlisted prisoners to work.
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.
Battalion, take up tools.
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!
Eyes right.
Eyes front.
Eyes right.
Quick march, eyes right.
Now, you will be reasonable.
You will order your officers to work.
No.
I will count three.
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
One.
I warn you, Colonel Saito.
Two.
Stop!
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.
Murdering unarmed men?
You see, Jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.
That kind of guts.
Also the kind they had in 1914 when officers fought with only a swagger stick.
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.
What about him?
Here we go again.
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.
Tell them to go.
Not you.
Come.
Leave him alone!
And so say all of us
And so say all of us And so say all of us
And so say all of us
Timber!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Let go!
You wish to see me?
I could have you shot.
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.
I knew nothing about the escape.
It does not matter.
One must even respect those who tried.
For a brief moment, between escape and death they were soldiers again.
But it is insane to try and escape.
Two soldiers shot, the third drowned.
To what end?
It was an escape from reality.
There is your reality.
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.
And this shows the position of actual progress.
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.
Then who would build your bridge?
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.
Do not speak to me of rules.
This is war!
This is not a game of cricket.
Sit down, please.
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.
Thank you.
And many will die, and he will be responsible.
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.
Sir....
I brought you a few things.
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.
And the officers?
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.
Jennings.
Poor, brave lad.
Carry on.
Blackmail.
I know, sir, but he means it.
The men are doing a wonderful job.
Yes, Clipton, I understand.
Truly.
No.
Principle!
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.
Give in, sir.
Please!
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
Please thank those concerned.
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.
Reynolds stole the coconut.
Goodbye, sir.
And good luck.
Many thanks.
Did you say that American chap was killed?
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.
Three men killed, and to what end?
The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
Whatever that means.
Well?
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.
He is responsible.
Not I.
You sick?
Are they both mad?
Or am I going mad?
Or is it the sun?
Attention!
Battalion, attention.
English prisoners.
Let us ask the question why does the bridge not progress?
You know why, because your officers are lazy!
They think themselves too good to share your burden.
This is not just.
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.
But there is another cause.
I do not hide the truth.
With deep shame and regret I admit to you the failure of a member of the Japanese staff.
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.
He is a bad engineer.
He is unworthy of command.
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.
Tomorrow we begin again.
I shall be in personal command.
Today we rest.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
As token of regard for your efforts in the future I give presents to you all.
Let us be happy in our work.
Company, dismissed.
Battalion, dismissed.
Hey, take a look at this.
Red Cross!
Hey, Harry, look.
Most likely gonna give him another pasting.
Good evening, colonel.
Do you mind sitting over here?
I am having rather a late supper.
English corned beef.
No, thank you.
Produce of Scotland.
I prefer it to sake.
I spent three years in London, you know.
I studied at the London Polytechnic.
Cheers.
Sorry.
Later, perhaps?
Perhaps.
I was not a good artist.
My father disapproved.
He felt I belonged in the army.
So I changed from art to engineering.
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
I do not think you quite realise my position.
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May.
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.
But officers are working along the entire railway.
You know it.
I know it.
Will you have a cigar?
No.
Thank you.
When I said all officers must work naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.
My orders were only intended for officers below--
None of my officers will do manual labour.
Please!
I was about to say:
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
What would you do if you were me?
Cheers.
I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
Do you understand that?
Please sit down.
Now, tell me, colonel do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?
Now....
Take this bridge of yours.
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance who have built bridges all over India.
The men respect them.
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.
A pretty poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
Really?
And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?
I hate the British!
You are defeated but you have no shame.
You are stubborn but have no pride.
You endure but you have no courage.
I hate the British!
Pointless, going on like this.
Stay there!
Stand down.
Stand down!
Battalion, attention!
Battalion, stand at ease.
Please....
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.
In honour of this occasion I have given your troops a day of rest.
Many thanks.
I am declaring a general amnesty.
You and your officers may return to your quarters.
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.
How many men in your party?
But, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir.
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.
And-
A corporal should always know how many men he has under him.
Oh, yes, sir.
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.
No, sir.
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.
Yes, sir.
You ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in Madras, Bengal....
If this were your bridge how would you get it under way?
Get it under way, sir?
Oh, why not?
You see those piles?
Where would you build it?
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?
No teamwork.
Some of those parties are actually working against each other.
Yes.
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
Thanks to the Japanese, we now command a rabble.
But fortunately, we have the means at hand.
The bridge.
Yes.
I see your point, sir.
You mean, you really want them to build the bridge?
I know our men.
Here again I know the men.
Can we make a go of it?
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
Well, I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.
Now....
Oh, yes.
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily and, I have to add, incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately, yes.
Our engineer has made a study of the site and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft.
Too soft?
Mud.
All the work up to now has been useless.
That bridge would collapse under the first train.
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.
Colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?
From a yard and a half of earth moved to two.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
I would strongly urge we revise the organisation of the working parties.
Just a moment.
Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?
Of course.
If we--
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....
As most of the British will work on the bridge only a small number will be available for railway work.
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.
I have already given the order.
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.
I have already given the order.
I think that completes the agenda for this evening.
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.
And are there any other questions?
One question.
Can you finish the bridge in time?
Is there anything else?
No.
Thank you.
The meeting is closed.
By the way, I meant to tell you there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.
Six hundred years.
That would be quite something.
Good morning.
Kiss!
Too many eyes.
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas when all I need is love.
All you really need is love.
And I always follow my heart.
Kiss.
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?
Yes, sir.
Brass ahoy.
He wants to see you.
Like a martini?
How did you get that?
Oh, yes, of course.
Jolly good.
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316.
Our headquarters is up in the Botanical Gardens.
We have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.
You could give us no end of valuable information.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Well, if you want to go over the whole thing again.
Lord Louis will be grateful.
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8.
This evening?
Out of the question.
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?
Good luck.
Thanks.
General salute!
Present arms!
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, driver.
All right, thanks.
Good show, Jenkins.
Good show!
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.
Use your knife.
Good!
On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.
Come on, move yourselves!
Move!
Move quickly!
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Wait a minute!
Sorry, sir.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
Very good of you to come.
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.
Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.
Such a melodramatic air.
What do you do here?
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
That pop was made with a lump half this size.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
See?
You can do what you like with it.
This is my place.
Go ahead.
Do you read this?
Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.
I never congratulated you on your escape.
It was a good show.
I was lucky.
No, I suppose not.
Would you like to see where you were?
All right.
But we think the camp is about here.
Say, do your people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?
He had guts.
Here is the River Kwai, and here is the village where you were helped.
And here is the railway.
But then you must be fairly familiar with all this area.
Not really, I was out of my head half the time.
The railway starts down here in Singapore.
Malaya Bangkok, Rangoon.
Their idea is to drive on through, into India.
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok- Rangoon section by the middle of May.
With demolition equipment through that jungle?
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.
You see, none of us have ever been there.
Lucky you.
No, thanks.
Well, there is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?
Come again?
To ask me this?
Well, frankly, yes.
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.
Now you want me to go back?
This is embarrassing--
I belong to the American Navy.
Actually, Colonel Green has taken the matter up with your people.
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your ClNC Pacific authorising your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316.
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.
I mean it.
Look.
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.
Later on, we ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.
I figured it was just a matter of time before I was captured--
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.
I thought officers would get better treatment.
There were certain advantages.
I saw one of them on the beach.
Finally your ClNC Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?
No.
You see?
Hot potato.
Simulated major.
That figures.
Well....
Good show!
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.
This is Major Shears.
He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.
Really?
Good show!
Jolly good show, major!
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
Get cracking.
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.
Yes.
What do you think?
Sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?
A good idea?
Take another look.
Discipline has been restored?
Their condition has been improved?
They feed better and they are no longer abused.
Perhaps even as treasonable activity.
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?
Take a good look, Clipton.
One day the war will be over.
I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built, and who built it.
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.
Hold him!
Hold him!
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?
Good morning.
What on earth are you people staring at?
Get on with your jobs!
Now get him with your boot!
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.
Sit down.
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
All right, at ease.
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle.
Yes, sir.
You were an accountant in Montreal?
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.
Exactly what did you do?
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures which people had checked before me and then other people checked them after I had checked them.
How did you happen to wind up here?
About two years later I volunteered for this work.
See, the regular army--
Go ahead, you can be frank.
Well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life.
Think about this.
I know how to use it, sir.
Could you use it in cold blood?
Could you kill without hesitation?
And what was the answer?
Thank you, Joyce.
Am I to go with the team, sir?
You see what I mean.
Well, at least he was honest.
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.
If he wants to go, he can even take my place.
I had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.
Blast.
This is awkward.
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Well, maybe--
Arrange some practice jumps for him.
Well, feel like a sniff of air?
Yes, sir.
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.
The new L pill.
Instantaneous, painless.
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.
The objective comes first in our work.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
I understand, go ahead.
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.
Joyce is....
Cambridge don and all of that.
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.
And many other installations before the Japs caught him.
He--
Two jumps, 80 percent.
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.
With or without parachute?
Oh, very good!
With or without!
There are too many Japanese patrols.
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.
Is there something wrong?
I was just thinking.
Tell that to Chapman.
Lovely.
Be happy in your work.
Yes, sir.
Leeches.
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.
Like everything else in this jungle.
You might as well dump it!
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything.
New construction downstream from first site.
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.l.P.
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.
Three, synchronize demolition with passage this train.
Four, good hunting.
A train and a bridge!
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th.
Oh, by all means.
Good hunting.
Good show.
Jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
The officers are going to work?
Why not ask Saito for some of his men?
This is our show.
We must make the most of our resources.
The sick list.
No reflection on you but there are always a few malingerers.
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.
Temperature of 104.
Right.
I see.
And this man?
Leg ulcers.
I may be able to save the leg if I do more cutting tonight.
Really want to send him out to work, sir?
I wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties might do more good than being cooped up.
Well, is it?
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful.
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.
Tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?
What about you?
Nothing difficult.
Now, look here, men.
For those of you who feel up to it how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?
What do you say?
Come on, follow me.
Ten minutes.
Come on, Joyce.
Go that way, Joyce.
I could have done it.
I was ready.
Are you hit, sir?
I can walk on it.
Yeah, but how far and how fast?
What are you doing?
We all need it.
Maybe six.
Come on.
Yeah.
You make me sick with your heroics.
You carry the stench of death like the plague.
Explosives and L pills go well together.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.
This is just a game, this war.
For what?
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!
If we go on, we go on together.
Good old Yai.
Come on.
Still sorry we brought you along?
Thank you, major.
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.
Look.
Those poor devils down there.
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little.
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.
The problem is where to hide it.
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by the Japanese.
Look.
Do you see those fallen tree trunks?
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.
Yeah.
It looks like your line of country, then.
Thank you, sir.
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.
All clear?
Any questions?
Yai.
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.
Shears.
I know.
I think so.
Want me to handle it?
Thanks.
Load.
Beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
A first-rate job.
I had no idea it would turn out so well.
Yes.
A beautiful creation.
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.
I love India.
But there are times when suddenly you realise you are nearer the end than the beginning.
And you wonder....
You ask yourself what the sum total of your life represents what difference your being there at any time made to anything or if it made any difference at all, really.
But tonight....
Tonight....
Blast.
I must be off.
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.
Lovely.
As you know, most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.
Now that your work here is finished I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.
What you have done should be and I think will be an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.
You have survived with honour.
That, and more.
Here in the wilderness you have turned defeat into victory.
I congratulate you.
Well done.
To the king.
Now, you got everything?
Sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.
Yes.
Except to wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you.
You can see the wire.
The charges!
Do it now!
If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.
Why?
As you please.
Good morning.
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.
Our own man!
I was right.
There is something going on.
Colonel, have you a knife?
Mined?
Good boy!
Officer, sir.
British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.
British commando orders.
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let me go, sir!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Help!
Kill him, Joyce!
Kill him!
You!
What have I done?
Madness.
I had to do it.
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.
It was the only thing to do!
Madness.
Oh, good evening.
I guess if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.
But for the benefit of the backward, I shall explain.
The subject is strapped in this chair.
I then turn this valve, and the water drips on his head.
One drop each minute.
After about a week of this, I suddenly turn the water off.
It produces the most astounding effects.
It is especially valuable if you have a friend who wishes to lose his inhibitions.
Naturally, you may lose your friend too.
However, there is one serious danger.
Because in a few days, the force of the dripping water can actually drill a hole through the wood.
But some people expect it to.
Is this a conspiracy, Myra, or may I have a light?
We were just talking about Ann Warren and her husband.
Trouble in paradise?
So I hear.
Thanks.
Hello, Ann.
Margot, are those women talking about me?
Those women are talking about everybody.
I suppose so.
Would you like a cigarette?
Margot, how do you balance a bankbook?
I was going to call you this afternoon, Ann.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Beat?
To a pulp.
Anything wrong?
Oh, no.
Not really.
Something sprang a leak in the basement.
Hmm.
Oh, by the way, I asked the Warrens over for dinner.
Not tonight?
Oh, no.
Friday.
I invited them on the spur of the moment.
Her biggest problem is Joe Warren.
How should I know?
Well, you saw him last weekend at the Country Club.
He just sat and glowered all evening.
I guess not.
I thought you liked living out here.
I do.
I mean, when the big event of my day is a leak in the basement?
What you need is a good knife murder, or one of those juvenile gang wars.
Oh, shut up.
Did you get it fixed?
No.
First thing in the morning.
Come on.
Get washed up.
Oh, and honey?
Make sure you get an estimate before you let him do any work.
Yes, dear.
I had such good luck with the butcher.
Mrs. Brenner?
Yes?
You phoned me up about a leak?
Oh.
Come in.
Thanks.
Would you make a note of the time?
I work by the hour.
Say, this is a nice place you got here.
I like the way you got it fixed up.
Thanks.
Well, yes, most of it.
Now, this is what really interests me.
The kitchen.
Not like most men, huh?
No, I suppose not.
I kind of make it my business to know just what appeals to women.
You know something?
Would you believe that?
No.
Not really.
Oh, about 19, 20,000 a year.
You know that Rhoda Forbes that lives down the block?
Yes.
I know Mrs. Forbes.
Well, I...
I guess I better take a look at that leak.
Do you know where the turn-off valve is?
Oh, say, my husband said to get an estimate before you do the work.
Anything you say, Mrs. Brenner.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Rhoda.
Yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, no, no.
It takes a couple of minutes, you know.
Now, where is that?
Upstairs?
Oh, yes.
Why do you have to go upstairs to fix the leak in the basement?
Say, Rhoda, will you call me back again in a few minutes?
No, just a domestic crisis.
Yeah, thanks.
The bathroom is over there.
Hey, you painted this.
Margot Brenner.
Yes, last summer.
Up in Maine.
Well, what do you know.
A real artist.
I never met a celebrity before.
No.
You got real talent.
Listen, I never had much education before, but I got an artistic side.
I know something good when I see it.
I got real appreciation.
You know, people go through life with their eyes closed.
Not me.
You take this room for instance.
I can tell you got good taste.
You take those drapes, take this furniture, take that bedspread.
How much you pay for a spread like this?
Please.
Sure.
I know I talk too much.
Got a lot of style.
Just like you.
Put it down.
Okay, okay, okay.
Nice and silky.
You look scared, Mrs. Brenner.
You know, it takes curiosity to be a good plumber.
Well,
Mrs. Brenner.
Now I ought to be able to give you an estimate in a couple of minutes.
I think I found out where the trouble is.
Ought to be real easy to fix.
How much is it going to cost?
Yes, sir, this is a mighty fine kitchen.
Not many people would be able to afford a house like this.
$500.
What?
$500.
Now wait a minute.
Hear about what?
About us.
Being upstairs together.
People would wonder how I knew about that painting you did in Maine, and about the bedspread, and the pink negligee.
How about the neighbors?
What time is it now?
You and me, all alone, Mrs. Brenner.
And you too busy to even answer the phone.
Why, it never rang.
Why this is blackmail.
Myra?
Neither did Ann Warren.
Ann Warren?
You blackmailed Ann Warren?
Yeah, I know.
And they tell me her husband is kind of jealous, too.
Sue me?
For damages.
On account of I hurt my back when I slipped and fell in that bathroom of yours, upstairs.
You ask your husband about the legal points.
Sure.
I know.
But you can get it.
You see, I know all the angles to this game.
I do it a couple of times a month.
I average close to 15 grand a year.
Tax free.
Yeah.
I know.
See you, Mrs. Brenner.
Lewis, breakfast in five minutes.
Just going to have my shower.
Oh, get me the police department please.
Hello, this is Mrs. Lois Brenner, 173 Syosset Road.
Yes.
I would like to have an officer come over in about an hour.
Yes.
Thank you.
Are you absolutely sure?
Jack Staley?
Why thank you.
Well, he does.
When he comes, let him in and try to act as natural as you can.
Have you got the money for it?
Yes, right here.
Let me have it.
Good morning, Mrs. Brenner.
Just a minute.
Here.
The money.
You wanted $500.
Here it is.
We all make mistakes.
Oh, you mean about my back?
Oh, no, I only wrenched it a little.
Hello, Staley.
Mrs. Brenner, what are you trying to do to me?
She tells us that you tried to extort $500 from her.
Nothing.
All right, Mrs. Brenner.
How about it, Staley?
She made the accusation.
You say one thing, he says another.
No.
Okay.
On your way, Staley.
He was lying.
He knew that you were here...
The coffee cups.
He saw that there were two of them.
No, but...
Staley was born here.
Everybody knows him.
Because they were afraid to complain.
Not without some evidence.
If enough of you got together, you could make a case against him.
But it is true.
Okay.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brenner.
Mrs. Brenner?
Yes?
That was a dirty trick you tried to pull before.
I thought you had better sense.
I saw that one coming from way back.
You really got yourself into trouble now.
If I have to go into court, that cop will tell everything he heard today.
I know that.
Mrs. Brenner?
Do you hear me, Mrs. Brenner?
Yes.
Okay.
And no more tricks.
Or else I might have to raise the price on you.
Come in.
Thanks.
I think you know most of these ladies.
Yes, indeed.
Nice to see you again.
Hello.
Would you like a sandwich?
Or perhaps some tea?
No, nothing.
Nothing?
Oh, surely you want your $500.
All these ladies know about it.
Some of them have even paid you.
Okay.
Okay, Mrs. Brenner.
You have everybody here.
Are you all present?
Now what?
What are you going to do?
Sergeant Thompson?
Oh, this is Mrs. Lois Brenner.
Yes, I took your advice.
I have all the ladies here and I...
Oh, just a moment, Sergeant.
Did you want to speak to the Sergeant?
Okay, okay.
You win.
Oh, just a minute, Staley.
No.
We want our money back.
Are you kidding?
I spent it all.
What?
We all have some repairs we need.
Yes, we need a new sprinkler system.
Very good, Myra.
We have a heater to install.
What do you need, Ann?
Oh, I have a lot of jobs.
Over $300 worth.
Nothing doing.
Listen, I got to live too, you know.
Why?
Blackmail?
No, wait a minute.
We thought you would.
Now we have to decide on the order.
Shall it be alphabetical or should we do it in amount already paid?
Alphabetical.
My name is Adams.
Hi.
Hello, darling, all in?
As always.
How about you?
Another exciting day in suburbia?
I had some of the girls over this afternoon.
We had tea.
Tea?
What else?
Oh, the plumber came to fix the leak in the basement.
Oh, honey, did you get that estimate?
Stop worrying, darling.
A thief and blackmailer posing as a plumber.
Nothing is sacred anymore.
That is all for tonight.
Next week, we shall be back with another story.
Nothing to it, really.
Good night.
Oh, good evening.
I guess if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.
But for the benefit of the backward, I shall explain.
The subject is strapped in this chair.
I then turn this valve, and the water drips on his head.
One drop each minute.
After about a week of this, I suddenly turn the water off.
It produces the most astounding effects.
It is especially valuable if you have a friend who wishes to lose his inhibitions.
Naturally, you may lose your friend too.
However, there is one serious danger.
Because in a few days, the force of the dripping water can actually drill a hole through the wood.
But some people expect it to.
Is this a conspiracy, Myra, or may I have a light?
We were just talking about Ann Warren and her husband.
Trouble in paradise?
So I hear.
Thanks.
Hello, Ann.
Margot, are those women talking about me?
Those women are talking about everybody.
I suppose so.
Would you like a cigarette?
Margot, how do you balance a bankbook?
I was going to call you this afternoon, Ann.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Beat?
To a pulp.
Anything wrong?
Oh, no.
Not really.
Something sprang a leak in the basement.
Hmm.
Oh, by the way, I asked the Warrens over for dinner.
Not tonight?
Oh, no.
Friday.
I invited them on the spur of the moment.
Her biggest problem is Joe Warren.
How should I know?
Well, you saw him last weekend at the Country Club.
He just sat and glowered all evening.
I guess not.
I thought you liked living out here.
I do.
I mean, when the big event of my day is a leak in the basement?
What you need is a good knife murder, or one of those juvenile gang wars.
Oh, shut up.
Did you get it fixed?
No.
First thing in the morning.
Come on.
Get washed up.
Oh, and honey?
Make sure you get an estimate before you let him do any work.
Yes, dear.
I had such good luck with the butcher.
Mrs. Brenner?
Yes?
You phoned me up about a leak?
Oh.
Come in.
Thanks.
Would you make a note of the time?
I work by the hour.
Say, this is a nice place you got here.
I like the way you got it fixed up.
Thanks.
Well, yes, most of it.
Now, this is what really interests me.
The kitchen.
Not like most men, huh?
No, I suppose not.
I kind of make it my business to know just what appeals to women.
You know something?
Would you believe that?
No.
Not really.
Oh, about 19, 20,000 a year.
You know that Rhoda Forbes that lives down the block?
Yes.
I know Mrs. Forbes.
Well, I...
I guess I better take a look at that leak.
Do you know where the turn-off valve is?
Oh, say, my husband said to get an estimate before you do the work.
Anything you say, Mrs. Brenner.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Rhoda.
Yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, no, no.
It takes a couple of minutes, you know.
Now, where is that?
Upstairs?
Oh, yes.
Why do you have to go upstairs to fix the leak in the basement?
Say, Rhoda, will you call me back again in a few minutes?
No, just a domestic crisis.
Yeah, thanks.
The bathroom is over there.
Hey, you painted this.
Margot Brenner.
Yes, last summer.
Up in Maine.
Well, what do you know.
A real artist.
I never met a celebrity before.
No.
You got real talent.
Listen, I never had much education before, but I got an artistic side.
I know something good when I see it.
I got real appreciation.
You know, people go through life with their eyes closed.
Not me.
You take this room for instance.
I can tell you got good taste.
You take those drapes, take this furniture, take that bedspread.
How much you pay for a spread like this?
Please.
Sure.
I know I talk too much.
Got a lot of style.
Just like you.
Put it down.
Okay, okay, okay.
Nice and silky.
You look scared, Mrs. Brenner.
You know, it takes curiosity to be a good plumber.
Well,
Mrs. Brenner.
Now I ought to be able to give you an estimate in a couple of minutes.
I think I found out where the trouble is.
Ought to be real easy to fix.
How much is it going to cost?
Yes, sir, this is a mighty fine kitchen.
Not many people would be able to afford a house like this.
$500.
What?
$500.
Now wait a minute.
Hear about what?
About us.
Being upstairs together.
People would wonder how I knew about that painting you did in Maine, and about the bedspread, and the pink negligee.
How about the neighbors?
What time is it now?
You and me, all alone, Mrs. Brenner.
And you too busy to even answer the phone.
Why, it never rang.
Why this is blackmail.
Myra?
Neither did Ann Warren.
Ann Warren?
You blackmailed Ann Warren?
Yeah, I know.
And they tell me her husband is kind of jealous, too.
Sue me?
For damages.
On account of I hurt my back when I slipped and fell in that bathroom of yours, upstairs.
You ask your husband about the legal points.
Sure.
I know.
But you can get it.
You see, I know all the angles to this game.

@ 027
Times are tough.
So most people are working hard to get along.
Young men are, trying to do well on their jobs.
Thinking of their families.
Of getting ahead so they can buy a house.
And then a little car to go driving on Sundays.
Here is another sort of city, but only of men.
Many of them still in their twenties.
They work because they have to.
But society hopes the will continue to work after their release.
Sometimes society succeeds...
Sometimes it fails tragically.
The prison authorizes and parole board were confident they had succeeded
Lester N Gillis.
Soon to be better know as...
Hi Les.
Long time, no see.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on.
Hop in.
I asked you.
Who told you I was getting out?
The guy who got you out.
Guy who got me...
I got myself out by being a good boy.
Is he still alive?
Why?
You can ask him when you see him.
The parole officer will want you to get a job.
With Rocca.
Hello shrimp.
Simmer down little man.
Well, how does it feel to be outside for a change?
why get a little man?
Come on.
Tell me...
Do they let you read the newspapers up there?
When they serve breakfast to us in bed.
They sure must have rousted you around shrimp.
Hey, take a look up ahead.
Guys out of work all over the country.
Kids going hungry.
And those bums beat them up if they try to make a buck.
No.
So I found me a new gravy train.
The one with the glasses.
So you start him organizing.
The ones I know are on my payroll.
How loud do I have to talk?
One or two words ought to do it.
And for saying them, you get a grand.
He lives there.
Comes home about six for dinner.
About 7:30 goes down to union HQ.
Bunch of his boys hanging around there so... this is the best place.
Here.
Maybe I should have left you in the can.
I could put you back again.
But...
You know why?
I find something else for you to do.
I know some cops need talking to.
Keep your nose clean.
Solly.
See nobody gets their fingers caught in the cash register.
Sue... is this guy OK?
Reach back and buzz that buzzer.
OK.
Go on in Jim.
Every couple of weeks.
Hey, this is no good.
You know how long three hours is to me?
Longer than it is to me.
Ophelia.
306, The Stirling.
Somebody did the job.
Skip it.
Three hours.
I thought I told you not to knock.
Hey come on.
What are you guys after here?
What are you doing?
Put that rod away will you.
What ya looking for?
You got a lot of nerve.
Look I...
I gotta sleep in this room pal.
When I left the hotel, before I saw you
I went for a walk in the park.
Sitting there watching the pigeons when they shot the guy.
Rocca had them plant the gun.
I saw no one.
No one saw me.
Get out.
Board!
Slow down.
Your luck is due for a change.
Fat slob Rocca double-crossed me.
They were coming up the steps.
And he was laughing.
Real loud.
I put two slugs in his big fat belly.
Him and the other two.
Stop it baby.
Big blue Rocca.
All it took to cut him down to size was this.
the cops will sure be looking for Lester Gillis now.
Nelson?
Yeah, OK.
Find a drug store.
Nelson?
Yeah.
Mrs. Nelson.
This prescription call for two bottles and everything in the tin box.
I...
Take it easy baby.
Wait here baby.
Lie still.
Alright, honey.
Coming.
Coming.
I have to see the doc right away.
Oh yeah.
Patient to see you Dr. Saunders.
Doctor Saunders?
Susan, eh, right?
I never forget the free ones.
Our Martha will take the deposit.
Give me a cigarette will you.
What you trying to do, kill him?
You two must have just got married.
When do we get out of here?
Well, you could get out of here tomorrow.
They leave a nice, clean, small hole.
Come here Sue.
I was camping and the gasoline stove blew up in my face.
Did I ask you?
I was saving you the trouble.
Yeah.
Even got the wrong name.
Hey.
That fellow there...
I wonder what puss is under those bandages.
Go get the doc and find out who he is.
You boys wait here.
Come on buddy.
Well boys...
The money wagon pulls in exactly 11:55.
It better be.
The men will be swarming all over the joint for lunch at noon.
Was I ever wrong yet, Johnny?
Been around $70,000 every week for the last six months.
Does the armored car back up to the paymasters office, or park alongside?
My name is Nelson.
I like nicknames.
What outfits service the joint, you know, milk bottled water, ice.
Ones that use closed trucks.
Or did you forget to find out.
How many jobs have I sold you Johnny?
The ones with the check mark only come when called, the others every day.
I want to come every day Ralph.
Any of you jokers ever learnt a trade?
I can put a washer on a faucet.
Pick yourself a beat up paneled truck.
Fix it like it comes from Ace Plumbing Company.
Put some tools in it.
See you.
Come on.
Number one on the G list big enough for ya?
Yes.
Somebody dropped their watch down the drain or something.
Yeah, hangover.
Got to stop making his own.
Does it take two of you to fix a drain?
Ever try running a snake though all by yourself pal?
Let me look at your work order.
Alright.
Go ahead.
Tell Joe to lay off the cleaner fluid.
Park it over there by the fire hydrant.
Give us a hand.
Get in there.
Come on.
Hurry it up.
Captain Moores, Mr. Markey.
Fingerprints are all over the truck,
Blood too.
Somebody got it bad.
Alas poor Yorrick.
I knew him well.
Hey Doc.
Save some of that.
He might as well have kept his own face for all the good my retread job did him.
Well, I imagine it will suffice.
Poor John Hamilton.
Unwept, unhonoured and unsung.
There are many of his ilk hereabouts, sleeping here in unmarked graves.
Et tu Brutus.
The sun is shining.
Take advantage of it.
I sunburn easy.
You need some suntan lotion.
Why not bring me some next time.
Come to the office my dear.
Like he says.
Then I lost my license.
I know I should have said no, but she was so lovely.
Just like you my dear.
I was thinking of your practice.
You must meet a lot of interesting people.
Do you?
Only one of them.
Lay off him baby face.
We need him in our business.
Doc says I got to stay in bed for a while.
I was thinking of calling Fatso and buying a bank job for us.
Forget it.
I said forget it!
Like when that whistle went off, you shoot up the joint.
Pull the car round the back Miller.
Rest of you guys bring that junk in.
You heard him.
Get the stuff out.
You will.
There is.
Get out!
Get me long distance.
Come here and make like Mrs. Nelson.
Long distance.
Give me the Nagel Blueprint and Draughting company in Indianapolis.
Nagel Blueprint Draughting.
Nagel speaking.
Hello, Nagel?
This is Nelson.
Nelson.
Remember we went to school together in Danville.
School?
Oh, yes.
Baby Face.
Boss told me to call you and ask if you had a job for him.
He told me to call instead.
Yes I have something I think might interest him.
Is your office still in the same place?
No.
No, we moved.
You know a guy by the name of Bickman?
Extra here.
Hot off the press.
Prohibition has been repealed.
Get your extra here!
Yeah, a lot of other people unhappy.
Hey, somebody coming up in a car.
Come on.
Hold it, hold it!
Sue, get upstairs and keep an eye on things.
So you got the stuff, right off the boat.
No, right off the shelf.
You can buy it anywhere.
Yeah?
Kind of takes all the fun out of drinking.
And out of making it too.
Put the rest of the stuff on the table.
Stanley...
Take his car and ditch it.
Come along with me.
Wait at the highway then come in on foot
Preston, you and Duncan, come with me.
Patronized by the very best people.
Including me.
I suppose we walk up to the door and knock and they let us in.
In a manner of speaking yes.
I have all the plans worked out.
All I can see is trees.
You can drink this without going blind.
Are you afraid of him too?
Mr. Nelson.
Call me Ranald.
Ranald.
86 proof.
Are you going along on the next job?
If he wants me to.
About time you did.
I love him.
No woman ever has.
We were just talking.
I know his kind of talk.
He wants the cars left here.
The one out front is rougher.
Move!
Preston, get the car.
Have you gone nuts?
Baby, baby, wait!
Let him commit suicide.
Come on out of there.
Come on out!
Come on.
Hurry it up.
Get those hands up.
Go!
Was it Dillinger?
Was it Dillinger?
No.
Nelson.
Baby Face Nelson.
You stupe.
Here comes a car.
Get out and flag them Sue.
Get out.
Look, I never saw anything.
Trigger happy punk.
Have you heard from him?
You ask too many questions.
Is that all you found out?
So am I.
Not a line nor a whorl in the system.
Find it interesting.
I like it the way it is.
Sweethearts and mothers.
Their loved ones are without blemish.
Their mothers.
Luscious helpmate.
Top of your profession.
Poor Johnny.
Should have taken a leaf out of Homer.
Ulysses lashed himself to the mast.
Pour me a drink my dear.
These skilled hands of mine are behaving like aspen leaves for some odd reason.
Give him a good shot Sue.
Got an ink pad around Doc?
Desk drawer, my dear.
A clean piece of paper.
Drink your gas and shut up.
I think I want to retire.
Honey...
And the $5,000 I owe the doc.
Do your testimonial.
To the greatest surgeon in the world.
Outside on the front porch.
Come on Doc.
Give you a drink.
Then what took you so long?
I stopped by a creek and sat listening to it for a while.
What you do a thing like that for?
Three more men to live with than I bargained for.
Do we?
Look what we got here.
Are you alright?
I guess so.
I guess it was lucky for me it worked.
I hope it will be lucky for me.
Right, everybody...
Hands high.
Come on in front.
Come on!
Get up.
Come on over there.
Move!
The boss goes with us.
How come a little guy like you ever become a bank manager?
I studied and...
I do wear them.
You sure are little
Alright Harvey.
This place is alright.
Get out.
Go on.
Hitch yourself a ride home.
Come on.
Get the boys a drink.
Fatso sure picks them sweet.
Get yourself a drink Van, you deserve it.
Hey what is this?
We do all the work and he does all the counting.
Take away that vest and what is he?
You know why?
I know.
I keep pinching myself to make sure I am.
He had death in his eyes.
And then suddenly...
That look disappeared.
You know...
You recognize this man, Mr. Hall?
Er...
Just a minute...
Alex.
Weeks ago.
Card he gave me said he was a deputy county assessor.
Mason.
That was the name.
No!
That was Nagel.
Fatso Nagel!
Good morning Mr. Nagel.
Come in.
Why not.
What are you doing in it?
Making use of a search warrant a judge gave us.
Yes, but not here.
At the Midland First National, up in Michigan.
Do you recall doing any business with Baby Face Nelson?
This is The Nagel, Blueprint and Draughting Company, gentlemen.
Stop it Mr. Nagel.
Nelson killed a federal agent in Little Bohemia.
You were there.
We can charge you as an accessory.
Can you make the charge stick?
Where is Nelson, Mr. Nagel?
Then what were you doing at Little Bohemia?
Say I was there.
Say you tailed me there.
We thought of that.
This is his next job.
The Brewers Bank and Trust in St. Paul.
I can say a lot of things, but how do I get him to hold still and listen?
So you figure out a way to make him hold still and listen.
Susie.
Make a call to Daddy from a public phone on the other side of town.
Daddy?
11- 62 State Street.
Noon tomorrow and how much?
Shall we say five Baby.
It better be.
Better be.
Or did you?
Probably in front of Marshall Fields.
Turn you over to the police.
The back entrance.
Right here is the vault.
You figure on getting away in that?
This is awful slow.
You drive up awful slow.
The manager just took some armed guards to the vault.
Alright, reach up high Buddy.
Hurry up.
Shut up and face the wall.
Come on.
Move.
Right, give it to me.
You can divvy up the rest.
Where are the others?
Back in the vault counting their money.
Going back to the same hideout.
Ditch the car whilst I change clothes.
We ought to be getting home.
Lie to me Baby.
Wait a minute.
You forgot to give thanks.
Thanks.
We got a lot to be thankful for.
We got stew... and bread.
When?
A week or two.
A week or two.
Wanna call it quits?
No!
I went into this thing knowing the score.
Knowing our time was running out fast.
Slow.
Hi.
Not around here Mister.
I know just the man for you.
On up the road, about three quarters of a mile.
A guy called Bill Harris.
Baby.
Two men in a car asking for someone to guide them.
No hunters up here.
Pull up and turn around.
That looked like Nelson.
Send out an all points alarm.
Nelson is heading North on Highway 12.
Hand me that chopper.
We lost them.
Get down!
They hit the radiator.
Grab the money and make a run for it.
Baby!
Help me... here.
You... fin...
finish... finish me...
Sue.
Those... kids that day.
I was...
I was gonna...
I WAS GONNA...
Corvusalbus.
CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY
THE BAT WAS CAPTURED.
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FAMOUS DOCTOR KRUP.
Have you heard?
Yes.
Bastards!
We have to free the chief.
I know that, Tierno.
But how?
We will find a way.
The police will make sure that he gets it.
Go and get our people.
We will need them.
Okay, Tierno.
Where is the Captain?
Interrogating The Bat.
Have you got accomplices?
No.
So you work alone.
Two of his men are still at large.
One called Tierno and another one, escaped when they were busted.
Is that true?
I would advise you to speak.
Answer me!
What does this mean?
Answer!
If this is The Bat, who is sending his symbol?
Maybe those two guys we were talking about.
This is getting complicated.
We must be very careful.
They seem to be very dangerous.
I agree, Captain.
Yes, but his license was withdrawn.
Why was that?
How much evil can a man hold?
But, with the evidence we have... we can send him to jail for several years.
I hope so, Captain.
We must not worry about this.
I thank you all for your cooperation.
Give us the description of the fugitives... so as to proceed immediately.
Sure, Captain.
At last we shall have some peace and quiet.
With The Bat in jail, this is over.
What about the Curse of the Gods?
My father lost his life when he desecrated an Aztec tomb.
According to the curse... my death follows his, because I am to blame for what has happened.
Please Flor, just try to forget it.
Listen, once your mourning is over... we will get married and you will forget everything.
In the meantime, stay with us.
My daughter and I need you.
You are so kind.
That was quite a scare!
When I recall what happened to us... my heart starts kicking.
Really?
Of course!
Why should I risk my head?
You are a hero!
Ready?
Bastard!
Hurry up!
I will kill this intruder, my way.
THE BAT ESCAPED
Good evening.
Who are you?
Then why is your face covered?
I just came to tell you you are in great danger.
The Bat escaped.
Who are you?
I try to help you and anyone who is in trouble.
My mission to which I am fully dedicated is to fight against evil.
How did The Bat escape?
When he was taken to prison...
Tierno and his men rescued him...
I only want you to take precautions.
Is the police after him now?
Yes, of course.
Their dead partners are crying out for vengeance.
I have to go now.
If you are in trouble, you can call me.
See you soon!
The Bat is free.
When will this nightmare end?
In two or three days.
I need his help to organize my papers.
Then, we will leave.
It was a good idea that you sent that paper...
It was a good idea that you sent that paper... with the image of a bat.
I immediately knew you were trying to rescue me.
And fortunately we did it, boss.
You deserve a reward and I am willing to give you one.
Will we try again to get hold of it?
Yes, Lobo.
Nothing will stop us from seizing that fabulous treasure.
What should we do?
Listen carefully.
One night, long time ago...
Dr. Almada hypnotized his fiance Flor... to prove his theory... that he could send her by means of hypnosis... to live a former life she had experienced.
You have to tell me.
Can you tell me the name of the place you are in?
I need to know.
I need to know!
You have to tell me.
I am... in the great Tenochtitlan.
By doing so... the doctor sent Flor to Tenochtitlan... to the great Aztec Empire... where the girl had lived in a previous life.
She, who was devoted since birth to god Tezcatlipoca... and had to be a virgin... made love with Popoca, a great warrior... who, defying the terrible laws, proposed her to elope.
They were discovered by the priests... and were taken as prisoners to the temple... before the god Tezcatlipoca... to be punished for breaking the laws.
They were cursed by the Great Priest... who ordered to burn the sacrificial pyres.
Popoca was buried alive and was ordered... to look after the bracelet and breastplate for ever and ever... as his cursed soul would never rest in peace.
Some time later, he decided to look for those objects... that show the exact place where the Aztec treasure lies.
They were guided by Flor who remembered precisely... the road that led to them.
I saw the breastplate.
It was extremely beautiful... of incalculable value.
When the police captured me...
I was told that Dr. Almada... had taken back to the tomb... the breastplate and the bracelet.
And now, how will we find out where the tomb is?
How naive, Tierno.
Now boys, you know what has to be done.
Yes, Master.
We will bring the girl.
No guns, Tierno.
Yes, all right, Master.
Flor!
Two instead of one.
Yes, boss.
The girl woke up and we had to bring her.
Untie her.
Good evening, lady.
Delighted to see you again.
When will you stop interfering, Dr. Krupp?
Not until I get something that is extremely important to me.
The Aztec treasure.
No, miss.
The Aztec treasure... is the means to carry out an experiment... that will make me immortal and will shock the world.
And you want me... to take you to where the breastplate and bracelet are.
Really?
I know that.
Then you must also know... that an explosion destroyed the Aztec treasure... and killed my father.
My deepest sympathies.
But I hope the pyramid... is still in the same place.
Right?
Not with my help.
Of course not.
Quite true.
Flor, what will they do to you?
Take her away!
Lock her up!
In 12 hours time...
I will have hypnotized you.
They really kicked me hard.
And they almost scalped me.
We have to do something.
Who knows the dangers that Flor and Anita are facing.
No, Eduardo.
That could be dangerous.
If you call the police they could hurt them.
You are right.
I think you are right, but... this situation is horrifying.
Yes, Eduardo.
There is nothing you can do.
Try to calm down.
Besides, the watch is hidden.
This really hurts.
What a blow they gave me!
Listen.
You should ask The Angel for help.
Sure.
Bring the girl.
Yes, Master.
Come with me.
Come with me!
Here she is, Master.
She followed me like a lamb.
And there is no more resistance.
Follow me.
Her willpower is amazing.
Her subconscious struggles to overcome defeat.
Those are her sparks of rebelliousness.
Lobo, draw the curtains.
We will start immediately, Tierno.
Will you hypnotize her, boss?
Flor.
Give me your hand.
Look me in the eyes.
Look me in the eyes!
You are tired.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
She is under my power.
She will do whatever I tell her to do.
But first we have to take Dr. Almada prisoner... so when we are back with the breastplate and bracelet... he will decode the hieroglyphic... and tell us the exact place of the Aztec treasure.
Do you want us to bring him?
No, he might be waiting... and you could be captured.
Hello.
You know that I have your fiance and your daughter.
What do you want now, Dr. Krupp?
I want you to come... alone, to this address.
Tell me.
22 Montes Lorenos.
Did you write that down?
Yes.
And remember to come alone.
Understand?
All right.
We will wait till Dr. Almada arrives... and falls in our clutches.
Will you go?
Of course I will.
It could be a trap, you know?
I have no choice.
Flor is in danger.
Do you want me to wake Pinacate up?
He told us to let him know if we had any news.
No.
I have to go alone.
Stay here.
All right.
Angel...
Angel!
Eduardo has gone to meet The Bat... who has kidnapped Flor.
Do you know the address?
Yes, 22 Montes Lorenos.
He could be in great danger!
Can you help him?
Sure, Pepe.
Thanks, Angel.
They are bringing him in.
Very soon, the treasure will be ours.
Doctor Krupp!
Put him over there.
Where are my daughter and my fiance?
Your fiance is over here.
Your daughter is over there.
Nothing has happened to them.
Once I get what I want...
You will stay with my men... and when we return you will decode the hieroglyphic... so that we will be able to find the Aztec treasure.
I know, Dr. Almada.
If I told you what happened to us in the Aztec tomb...
All right, but bear the consequences.
Are you threatening me?
There are supernatural things... mysteries of afterlife of which you know nothing about.
You will tell me all about it.
Your conversation is very interesting... but now I only want to know if you will help me.
And what if I refuse?
I can persuade you.
Once I decode the hieroglyphic...
The alarm!
Someone has come!
If you called the police...!
Thank you for bringing him to me, Dr. Almada.
Keep an eye on him!
I can handle him, you finish with The Angel.
Angel, you have been interfering in my business.
This will be the last time.
You can keep you secret identity.
I wish you a good trip, white hood.
Take him to the death chamber!
Yes, Master.
Flor, can you hear me?
Answer me!
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Get up.
Watch the doctor and his daughter.
If you make a mistake, you will answer with your own lives!
Come, Flor.
Done!
Pepe, Pepe!
Come to 22 Montes Lorenos... the address you gave me.
Yes!
Can I wake Pinacate up so that he can help us?
Come as soon as possible!
Okay!
Where did you take The Angel?
Angel?
I can hear you, Pepe.
What should I do?
Go to the back end.
You can see a simulated door.
To open it... there is a button on the upper left-hand side.
Angel!
Quick!
Push me with that pipe so I can swing!
Hurry up!
Harder!
Go on!
Thank you, Pepe.
We have to rescue your brother.
We need a good strategy.
Come on.
Hands up!
Disarm them!
Take them away!
Angel, thank you so much!
Daddy!
Daddy!
My baby!
Calm down.
Pepe, take her home and stay with her.
And your fiance?
The Bat took her to the Pyramids.
The explosion really happened.
Tierno, bring everybody here.
We have to look everywhere.
The breastplate and the bracelet must be hidden here.
What is this?
Lift that rock up.
Master!
This mummy has been dead for centuries... and was driven out of her tomb by the explosion.
But Master...
The breastplate!
And the bracelet!
Finally, they are ours!
Hands up!
Over there!
You, too.
Throw your guns!
Put the breastplate and bracelet back!
No!
Tierno, quick!
Kill that monster!
Take her up!
Now we are really in a lot of trouble.
Forget it.
The only one that could save us is the Mummy.
We have to gain time.
Do you think the Mummy will find this place?
The mystery in the matter of spirits is impenetrable.
Superior forces will show the Mummy the way... as it happened on other occasions.
The Master wants to see you.
Come on!
She is my hostage, Dr. Almada.
I will release her only after you have decoded the hieroglyphics.
I am willing to give you half the treasure when we find it.
What do you say?
That you bring her here and wake her up.
Very well, Dr. Almada.
Can you tell me who brings the Mummy back to life?
The evil spirits.
Are you saying that there are powers of a supernatural world... that are bringing this mummy to life?
Wake up.
Wake up.
Eduardo.
Why are you tied up?
I have kept my word, Dr. Almada.
I hope you will keep yours.
Ancient Aztec History with the Precortesian Code.
I need it to decode the hieroglyphic.
How will we bring it here?
Call my brother on the phone.
He will bring it.
Are you going to do it?
Pepe?
This is Eduardo.
She is sleeping.
Maria looks after her.
Listen carefully.
There is a book on the second shelf of the bookcase.
Ancient Aztec History.
Bring it here, to Montes Lorenos.
To the same address, Eduardo?
Yes, to the same address.
Do as I tell you.
Before we go on... and as everybody seems so sad...
We will know who this advocate for justice is.
So this is the famous Angel.
Pinacate!
You are The Angel.
Congratulations.
You had a good costume.
Unfortunately, The Angel is finished.
And I treated you like a coward!
Forgive me.
I would have never believed it.
Have you finished, doctor?
You are too slow.
Only five more minutes, Dr. Almada.
I hope you keep your promise and let us go.
Sure.
What do you intend to do?
Kill us?
No!
Help me!
Help me!
No!
No!
No!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me, please!
Now, nobody will know where the Aztec Treasure is.
Now that the temple of the god is destroyed... she has nothing to do there.
She will probably look for a place where she can rest forever... with the objects entrusted to her by his ancestors.
THE END
THE ANGEL´S HOUSE
They´ll now give me coffee
I slowly finish dessert so that moment never arrives.
I will have to rise serve myself and approach him to offer that small porcelain cup
that hasn´t stopped trembling in my hand everytime I´m close to him.
My father says:
But he was too tired
She asked to my father:
He didn´t ask anything to Pablo.
That´s the only intimacy we have ever allowed to each other.
I approach him, he´s not sitted anymore
My eyes see his necktie and stop right there.
They have never reached any further.
That silence the fact that he never thanks for the coffee is between us, the only bond...
That represents his total possesion over me.
After, like every Friday at the same time I´m told someone has come to look for me.
I think of my father who says:
Without waiting for my answer, He adds:
I know they don´t have anything to say to each other.
And just as I´m gone my father will dismiss Pablo arguing that the next day he must visit some old brethren.
Pablo will be back next Friday.
I approach him ready to go out and I look at him, defiantly, and say:
I say his name so softly, that it drowns on my throath.
How many more Friday nights?
How many?
How many days waiting for him?
Everything is so far...
How can I remeber it so clearly?
Everything began that evening...
I was with my sisters
Julieta could never fulfill her own spiritual promises
Isabel, always absent.
She used to rebel against our way of dressing.
Ever night, before going to bed she used to dress herself like someone who is meeting the loved one.
There was my mother always caring, willing to discover the intention of sin in a gaze or in a smile.
Also that summer, there was our cousin Vicenta.
She always knew what to say to hurt me.
However, I was fascinated by her.
She was everything I could know about the others
To be a woman, like my mother
She once told me:
Then you must know everything
We must watch it.
That day, Vicenta told me:
No!
That´s not true!
Then why do they cover the statues everytime we come by?
We know everything!
They´re big, they are 20 years old.
That´s why they cover it.
We will be 20 years old someday too, It´s no big deal to look at them.
Look at them?
But how?
By uncovering them, fool!
No, we will be punished!
The robes are very well sewn.
We don´t lose anything for trying.
At the end of the park, there is one statue let´s look at it.
Come and look, don´t be silly!
Kiss him!
Where are you going?
Ana!
Why am I being sent to Buenos Aires?
I have told you three times
You are too old to be playing with boys.
And aren´t my sisters older than me?
My!
All these questions!
They are old enough to know what a sin is.
Is kissing a sin?
It depends on the intention.
I didn´t want to kiss him.
That´s why you are being brought.
You can´t recognize your intentions.
Least of all, the intentions of other people darling!
It´s always better to kiss a man than a statue.
Are you going to the city?
Could you give us a lift to the workshop on the corner?
Good evening sir.
He´s Pablo Aguirre, one of your father´s bethren.
Are you Pablo Aguirre, the congressman?
I always read your speeches.
They are really nice but you say things about poor people that I don´t understand.
Maybe, for the time being, ignorance is best for many people.
Yeah, sure...
Oh no!
We are already used to it!
This is Dr. Castro´s daughter.
Oh, nice to meet you!
Say Ramón, has Dr. Castro arrived to Buenos Aires?
Yes.
I think they will meet in the house tonight.
I didn´t know anything about it.
I thought that would be tomorrow.
Are you related to the Moreno´s?
Weren´t they?
They are nothing but fantasies.
Lies that can hurt.
I once met a man, honest filled with ideals and hope, who started to say that he carried dead in his gaze.
His life was ruined.
When one is really good what harm can rumors do?
For example, do you consider yourself to be good?
Aguirre, we are here
Pablo Aguirre, some years ago he killed a man in a duel.
But he is so young!
Oh darling!
Men just keep getting worse!
From a very young age, the devil gets in their bodies and stays right there!
Can you imagine hell Ana?
Thousands of fire tongues touching your body
Ovens, heat, fire!
Can you imagine that Ana?
Go up to your room while Ramón helps me with the luggage.
Nation´s journalism depends on tomorrow´s meeting
So, Pablo Aguirre is our man.
Besides being a brilliant speaker, his last years in Europe and USA, have made him capable of defending our ideas.
Besides, He stands for the liberal part of our movement.
I insist that Pablo is not the right man for our controversy tomorrow.
Esquivel is too high-spirited and we could be affected by that.
You mean to say that Pablo Aguirre will not be able to handle this situation?
I didn´t.
Don´t you remember the unfortunate incident prior to Pablo´s travel?
Women´s stuff!
Mom will be here in few days
What happened?
Well, go up to your room.
We´ll talk later.
Well done Ramírez!
So, it´s done gentlemen!
What were you doing Nana?
Nothing, nothing!
I was praying.
Who are you praying to?
God or Christ?
My, what a stupid question!
They are the same thing!
I pray to Jesus.
God is an old man with a beard.
Hope your mother doesn´t hear you saying those things.
But why do you pray so much Nana?
Don´t you ever pray?
For what?
What do you mean for what?
Praying is necessary
The Sin is not only the death of the soul, but also of the body!
The resurrection of the dead is denied to your body if you are in mortal sin.
It will burn for all the eternity!
Take a good look at that painting!
It´s the end of the world!
It´s only waiting one word from God to be unleashed!
An angel will come out of it, and by playing his trumpet masses of fire and hail mixed with blood will fall over the earth
Warm blood, like that of chickens and lambs!
All of that, for just ONE mortal sin?
And the pit of abyss will be opened and locusts that look like horses ready for war will come out of it
...and they will have woman´s hair...
I see a picture like this everyday, bigger and in a frame.
Also in a museum.
In a museum eh?
Three naked women?
I´ve seen that picture and you can see it if you like, it´s on my living room.
What about that one?
Have you seen it?
Maybe your sisters have.
Look what you have done!
We will have trouble with the jesuists.
It was all your fault!
If we ever get you on the street you will tell the story!
We will tell him those pictures are yours and of your sisters!
Ana, why are you jumping out of the window?
Don´t you worry, you won´t be alone.
Your sisters will be here in the afternoon.
Nana, how was the last duel at home?
I can still see it... the night was clear.
The moon was very big, like it was hanging up there
Suddenly, two carriages arrived
Dr. Timio descended from one all dressed in black
He was being followed by his godfathers, they were three.
They silently entered into the house.
The door grated behind them.
Your father came out to receive them.
Then, they went into the room...
He was very pale, like if his blood was already spilled.
The swords were shining with the moonlight!
The silence was so deep, that no human soul dared to stop it.
And who died?
Haven´t you guessed?
Laburdel was doomed.
Dr. Timi was a famous swordsmen.
And when Congressman Aguirre was in duel, did it happen here?
No.
That duel was never told by anyone.
Was that the reason why Congressman Aguirre left for Europe?
I don´t know.
Maybe.
We´re not here to discuss the decisions of the Party.
We will now proceed to read the act of the previous session
By Secretary, we will read a project bill of communication presented by congressman, Pablo Aguirre.
I ask to speak.
Congressman Ariel, has the word.
Dear Presidents and fellow congressmen 1810 represented for our country the cry of freedoom that will make argentinian people very proud for many years... 1816 stands for the ratification of that freedoom.
Because one of the main conquers of contemporary man... it´s the freedoom of speech.
There where any tyranic force starts to sign the empire of their demands only the good, naked word, unleashes freedoom and justice.
One closed journal, one single page banned one deleted word, represent an agression against liberty and culture that civilized man cannot stand!
What Liberty?
Congressman Esquivel has the word.
The words of Aguirre, moving and deep fill me with emotion.
How much would we like to believe in the honesty of his intentions... to sincerely stand up to applause, instead of imposing the interests of our opposition.
But the words need, from that who speaks them, background and moral dignity... not always present at the same time.
Ask to Pablo Aguirre, how did his father make his fortune...
I demand to the President that the Chamber goes to a fourth intermission.
There are many ways to defend the ideals of a Party, not all of them are good!
As long as I can´t prove he´s wrong...
The hability of your father is undisputable...
I´m sorry Castro, it´s impossible.
I need to find out something.
Sorry, I´m being expected.
You have made me wait so long...
I´m tired of being asked if I´m sent by the models of Paris or when I´m marrying you....
Don´t make me feel so responsible for everything that happens to you!
It´s the second time we discuss marriage this week, we must be getting old...
Cristina, my father has been severly accused on the session... the country is living the crisis of a liberalism, no way out of it... our youth is being corrupted by the example of an intelectualized and decadent Europe.
And you keep bothering me with a situation that was already solved.
The Peña´s bore me, maybe I´ll stay with my dad.
Your father´s house is a poker table.
You are fatter Ana, I couldn´t tell with the dress.
I´m just as always
I´m tired of bathing with my dress on
Isabel doesn´t do it, but she locks the door
You´ll see...
Come with me Ana, I´ll talk to you later...
Would you tell me why you kissed your cousin Julian?
I don´t know.
Didn´t you think of the danger that men represent for you?
You´ll never kiss a man, unless you are married
And from this night on, you will sleep in a separate room.
You´re to young to be listening to their conversations
This one only knows to eat marshmallows.
It´s better to eat marshmallows than standing all day in front of the mirror
You will never understand what is to me, to get rid of this horrible thing we wear...
I think I understand
Because they were speaking in the name of a local transportation business that had stocks in the place who were keeping that zone in a state of indigency and barbarity.
Were they being kept that way, or by inertia, or by the State... that was preparing to negotiate?
Even with that, I don´t see a reason for their cancellation.
Everything can look real at a certain time
But in that time, those voices could move the people
And what about the freedoom of speech, the ideals of the Party?
Come on Pablo!
It´s like if you were 20 again.
But you made a profit out of that situation!
I would have made a profit anyway.
There are some men meant to be rich and you wouldn´t be able to be in this economic position.
What´s the meaning of being rich if you have to pay a whole life of embarrassement.
That politics always do the same
The tout of ideals, behind of which the darkest interests unleash...
Didn´t you think that those resources favored the interests of one group could be used in the future as a tool for opression and lie?
Every situation must be defended at the right moment.
I came here to talk about that, but your political attitude matches your private life.
What do you mean?
That your personal behavior, even in the presence of my mother... has resulted in that way of thinking.
And you come to claim for it.
I see that your false puritanism hasn´t diminished with the years besides, you don´t have to be ashamed for anything.
I think I explained the matter prefectly.
Perfectly, with the same hipocrisy that you, relying on legal niceties, betrayed the whole country!
Pepe, bring me the bottle, I´ll need some whisky.
One drink with Mamma Janet will immediatly leave you cool!
I´m not available for anybody
Guys, I´m going to come off cheap since I´m already drunk.
Send me a little angel, so she can watch my dreams.
Now a toast for the most handsome congressman!
For the most stupid.
The poetess will recite something
Go on!
or do you need to fire to cheer up?
Go ahead or I´ll burn you!
Can I have a drink?
The only thing that purifies you is fire!
Don´t you move cause I´ll burn you!
It´s very hot!
Open a window!
Don´t go!
Don´t go!
Where are we going?
Well guys, let´s continue the party at a cooler place!
Pablo, Pablo!
While we propitiate freedoom of speech, look what these bastards are publishing!
An infamous charade!
They are not as far away from the truth as we would like them to.
What do you mean?
There´s only one thing I can do...
Don´t go to Congress today, who could believe in their words?
There´s only one way to shut them up!
What´s wrong Ana?
These are the same measures of last year... are you never going to grow up?
Well, are you going to use your evening gown tonight?
Ana is too young for parties.
Why do you say that Madame?
Ana is a woman now.
Why don´t you allow her mom?
A lot of young boys are coming...
In Europe,young girls are being allowed to dance at a very early age!
I don´t think the european model is appropiate
Besides we are in Argentina.
She will go with Nana to the movies.
These are the only ones we´re allowed to see
Calm please!
What a wonderful man!
Stop it!
Stop it!
They are stuck like flies!
Covering up, dark personal interests.
I ask for the word
Granted, C. Aguirre
These might be my last words in Congress... a few minutes ago, the officialist congressman... using a supposed and sad knowledge,
pretended to diminish, not only my position, but of our Party.
But this is not about making personal defenses.
Personal issues are solved in another field.
The man in his most pure manifestation which leads him to express his feelings his truth, despite growing danger... because, precisely, the truth of every man can become a danger for those that want that the individual to be a spring.
A gear without hierarchy in the monstrous social machinery.
Man has, in his defense, against possible agressions of the intelligence only one thing!
His moral solvency and his word made truth.
The written word is stoic, in action...
Congressman Esquivel has pretended, denouncing an alleged affair, comitted by my father disimulate the gravity of the present situation, in which freedoom of speech which is the root of people´s liberty, can be severely damaged.
The imprisonment of two newspapers directors for difamation of members of the cabinet is not only prejudicial against liberty of press, but it means the most sinister violation to people´s rights.
A nation in which press is not at the service of man doesn´t deserve respect from anyone.
And if to achieve that right, is neccesary for us to renegate of the most rooted feelings of caste and family so it be.
As far as my personal opinion goes, little can I add.
it would be futile to discuss if my father was or wasn´t loyal to his convictions by granting that concession that he believed to be good for the nation´s economy.
The truth is that C. Esquivel, has made manifest an hability for villainy proving himself to be a miserable coward, to whom my only answer is this!
Ana!
Ana, come to say hello
And how did you like it?
I really liked it.
It´s different to the others.
You can learn to kiss with that one, with who have you practiced?
I´ll go get the girls and we´ll leave
Ana, you´ll have dinner upstairs with Nana
I don´t think this boys will leave anytime soon
What on earth is that?
Ana, upstairs!
I´m sorry madame, C. Aguirre is asking for the Dr.
He´s upstairs in his desk Show him in.
The duel has to be in this house!
Only then, I´ll only accept to be your godfather.
I´m sorry Dr. Castro, I wouldn´t like to cause any more trouble
On the contrary.
I was eager for a duel in this house they have been passing in the last years but in the good times, Valencia, Cevallos and Timi knew how to duel.
I feel very honored Dr. Castro
The honor is mine.
Have you already chosen weapons?
Guns. 20 steps.
To death.
When honor has been hurt, that´s the way it has to be.
Have lunch with me tomorrow.
I want you to sleep here it´s a tradition in my house prior to any duel.
Come...
My mother won´t allow it
Don´t listen to her, maybe it´ll be your first dance and my last.
Thanks
Is it your first time dancing?
I´ve never cared too much for dancing
However, one feels wonderful turning and turning
I never thought you´d like to dance with me
Luckily, those times are back
What do you mean?
That can´t be!
He had sworn!
He´s not in duel madame, it´s in the house´s park, tomorrow at 5 a.m.
C. Aguirre is dueling against C. Esquivel for the accusations made in Congress.
Sin!
In my own house!
What example am I giving to my daughters?
Go, Ramón!
Your way of dressing, you all look like novices, those women that marry God!
If there were more people that dress like us and not in the shameless way they do... things would be different!
You´re so right madame!
If things were different... my wife is expecting her fifth child
maybe we will have to live without him.
Holy Mother of God!
What are you saying?
What´s happening today?
That´s a crime, a crime!
What do you want?
The kid will die of hunger.
I´ll help you.
There are institutions that take care of everything... and if your wife has to work, they´ll take care of the child.
Institutions...
I know all of them.
The only thing you want later is to figure.
Exploters!
You get down here.
Sanctimonious!
I´ll call the police!
Police!
Can I help you?
We never ask help from the devil!
Again, and to death!
It´s on the papers.
I won´t allow it!
I won´t allow it!
It´s Pablo Aguirre, the man who came last night and danced with Ana white as marble, he already had dead in his gaze.
I will never allow it in my house!
We have always held duels in this house.
I don´t know what´s so shocking to you
I can´t allow it.
Dueling is forbidden
Specially in this house.
Besides, our daughters are here.
Don´t you ever think about them?
Lock them up...or better yet... let them come down, that way they´ll see that there are brave men.
so they know, as long as I´m alive, that this house will attend all honor calls.
How long will we continue like this?
How long?
Do you have any other solution?
or have you become a progressist?
If it´s for your daughters I´ll stay with Ana or better yet, take them all!
You educated them, didn´t you?
Don´t worry about me, I can take care of myself!
Yes, with a trip to Paris or with any party girl don´t you?
Here we go again.
Do you still believe those stories?
You won´t be saved!
You won´t be saved!
I won´t be condemned by one more duel in my house.
Turn on some candles, maybe if you pray no one will die.
You´ll be damned!
You´ll be damned!
TODAY, SISTER PLACIDA´S PUBLIC CONFESSION
You also like public confessions?
I always come, they are very fun sometimes
I sinned My Lord, I sinned!
Receive me again in your arms!
Being young, I deceived my parents, being with other men!
then my husband, and now my children who take me for a saint!
I´m a sinner, a big sinner!
I regret and I won´t sin again!
That´s what it says?
Sir, can I borrow your Bible?
I won´t read this, it´s not interesting
Here it is
Why don´t you read it all?
Because it´s not interesting.
Really.
Listen
You know what that means don´t you?
King Salomon and his mistress, hear what it says...
Here it is
Listen to this Ana, this is specially for you...
You realize everything now, don´t you?
If you don´t gain weight, on your breasts or your baby goats...
No one will love you.
No one.
Let´s go.
Why did you wait until now to leave me?
Because today, yesterday and the day before have had a special meaning for me.
I´ve discovered that a lot of things in which I used to believe, are worthless.
they have always been!
What do I have to do with all of this?
You were part of that negative life.
I knew that between us there was nothing but we continued, why?
For feeling failure better...
I cheated on you with meaningless affairs
I was cheating my ideals and my country with small political actions and you, the party and the country allowed me to do so.
a little spoiled, who have to be cheated, because, deep down, you needed to be cheated on.
You´re choosing an elegant way of comforting me even though who you want to abandon is me.
I´m not choosing anything, I´m looking for a way of living
Suddenly, I´m without a past or a future.
with the only possibility of killing a man or being killed by him.
But you are also defending your honor
My honor.
My honor was one of those fake facades.
Behind, there were my father´s weaknesses, the weaknesses of my Party or my own inconsistency.
Now you see how little reasons I have for die or kill
This time, maybe it´s better if he chooses, don´t you think?
They will stand with their backs together
They´ll count 20 steps
They´ll turn around and BAM!
One of them will be dead.
Blood will run, they will close his eyes and they´ll cover him with a cape.
DUEL TONIGHT BETWEEN CONGRESSMEN AGUIRRE ESQUIVEL
He´s here.
He´s on the desk Dad ordered to go down for lunch
My older daughters, Julieta and Isabel.
This is Pablo Aguirre.
This is Ana, the youngest.
You must excuse my wife, she won´t be having lunch with us.
Aguirre, my wife
Shall we go to the dinning room?
No special considerations.
I´ve already dismissed the godfathers
If you´d like to rest after eating, the guest room is at your disposal.
Thanks a lot.
I could use some rest.
Alberto will be here at 3.
Have you thought that you could be killed?
Death is not the worst thing that can happen madame.
And your soul?
What if you kill Esquivel?
My wife is strongly devoted, I don´t know why there´s one of everything in her family
She takes care of the girl´s education.
If they had been boys, things would be different.
Nothing, it´s just that with me, the tradition of this house will die
Noble traditions never die Castro.
Men of good inherit them.
Let´s not think about that.
It´s a very important night.
You can go now
Ah the old times Pablo.
Do you remeber Palencia?
He had a privileged arm
Everyone knew his adversary was going straight to death.
Not everyone dies in duels.
God saves them.
Pray for him, for all of them
I´m sorry.
My mother sent it for protection.
Thanks.
I heard someone in the stairs... and those same steps on the dry leafs of the park.
I pressed my teeth to reinforce my only wish...his death
There were two shots at the same time.
I descended the stairs like a ghost, almost flying
Are you mad?
And in your night gown?
We´ll talk about this
The things that happened after that are meaningless and neither do the months that followed that day
when I opened my eyes during my sickness I could saw his figure lying in the door he didn´t dare to enter.
He became inseparable of my father
He was on my sister´s weddings in Nana´s death and on my mother´s.
But I had lost forever the shadow of the angel in my window Barranca´s Square, the park, the Briseño´s roundabout.
I came out of my house on the mornings and returned until dawn.
I walked in the city, getting lost in the most sad and remote neighborhoods.
but he was always there waiting for me.
I don´t know if he´s dead or alive.
I don´t know if we´re only two ghosts.
We should have died that night.
He in the duel and I in the angel terrace.
Cover yourself, it´s cold.
Good night Pablo
Good night Ana and you, the Party and the country allowed me to do so.
Peace.
You warriors are far from the reservation.
The Cheyenne signed a treaty.
No guns, no bows and arrows.
In the north, there have been many ranches burned, people murdered.
We search for those who have done this.
To the south, we trade with our brothers.
In peace we return to our farms and women at Sand Creek.
Next time, obey the treaty.
That old Chivington sure gonna be disappointed not to have somebody to shoot at.
Yeah.
Come in.
Lieutenant Hewitt is here, sir.
Oh, send him right in.
Lieutenant.
Welcome back, Hewitt.
Thank you, Captain.
Well, what did you find?
Sir, we ran across a band of Cheyenne off the reservation.
Yes?
How do you know?
They came from the south.
They were unarmed.
Not a rifle in the whole outfit.
You mean you saw no rifles but they were illegally off the reservation.
Have the bugler sound assembly.
Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do?
Double the ammunition ration.
Yes, sir.
Dismissed.
You know what would happen if we attack a friendly tribe.
My job here os to preserve the treaties and make those beggars keep the peace.
I said you were dismissed.
Look Colonel, every other tribe - the Arapahos, the Paiutes, the Comanches - will use this as an excuse to join with the Cheyenne on the warpath.
Not with me here to stop them.
And south of here?
South?
Texas, sir.
You know the South has cleaned their manpower for the Confederate army.
If putting Indians on the warpath helps us to win that fight, I have no objection.
One of us is sure dressed wrong, Colonel.
Did you hear what he said?
Well, I got ears.
Well, remember it.
Lebbard?
Yes, sir?
I want you to see that this gets to General Firewall.
What do you mean?
What are you gonna do?
Now wait a minute Lieutenant.
Charge!
This is the Texas border.
I know where I am.
You had any Indian trouble around here?
This far South?
What for?
Do you ask every customer the same question?
I am from Texas.
In that uniform?
Better hold him.
Here, use these.
They were just after guns and ammunition.
Here.
Where are you going, mister?
Yeah.
Till you get them things you were after.
Thanks.
Better get the doctor for Harry.
Try this.
I have got a lot of people to talk to.
Sure be nice to get close enough to talk to them before they start shooting.
Folks is sensitive to that colour around here.
Say, just exactly what are you?
From which side?
Both, I suppose.
Hey, Stella.
Stella.
Maybe.
You stay for dinner, we got peaches?
GO back to the house.
GO on.
Mind me!
Hi, Stella.
So did I.
In fact, I deserted to get here.
Did you think you were the only man in the world?
Now wait a minute...
Wait?
Was I supposed to wait, Mr. Hewitt?
Let me tell you - just one week after you left, I got married.
To a good man too, Ed Leathem.
Two weeks ago there was a massacre of Cheyenne at Sand Creek.
My regiment did it.
Now the Indians are on their way.
Indians.
You made that up fast.
Get off my land.
Stella, wait!
Your best chance is at the mission.
Damn Yankee!
Get her there, Bax.
Damn Yankee!
Hello, Miss Hannah.
Look...
The Comanches are on their way here.
I came to you because I figured you were the strongest woman of them all.
Listen?
Now, you listen.
You better get going before you get some patches on them blue breeches.
No more trouble out of you now.
Who are you?
Ann Martin.
At Shiloh.
Indians are on the warpath.
I want you to get your things and get to the mission as fast as you can, you understand?
Now, you start running.
Put that down Ann, your father and I were friends.
Now git!
Alright...
Keep moving, Yankee.
You git!
Nor did I. Maybe this will help.
Dora Hartley.
The way I found her; the way the Comanches left her.
You got an ugly way of telling things, Mr. Hewitt
Had to be shown.
There are things to do.
Most merciful Father, who has been pleased to take unto thyself... the soul of this, thy servant, Dora Hartley, grant unto us, who are still in our pilgrimage, who walk as yet by faith, who have served thee with constant servitude
that we may join thy blessed saints hereafter in glory everlasting.
# You pass by my door, a singer, a song
Good afternoon.
How do you do?
La-di-dah.
Are you ladies from around here?
Certainly not.
And the first thing that I wish to make clear is that I am not with this... this...
Er... creature?
Thank you.
Our driver deserted two days ago to go and find a new freight wagon when this one broke down.
Found them on Rocky Flats and I thought I better bring them here.
You did right.
Put a wheel on this vehicle, and we too shall be on our way.
Indians?
Men Indians?
You might as well alight.
Indians!
Get down over there!
You should have seen yourselves.
You, too, yellow-liv...
Stand easy, son.
I thought you should hear the sound of the only Indian within 100 miles.
Or maybe you really believe that tall tale of yours, huh?
Her killing was done by a stray, full of whisky.
Time it took you ladies to make up your minds gave the Comanches the time to close off the valley.
I say we stay here.
All Of us.
How many of you ladies know how to shoot?
You can put your hand up.
I can shoot good, damn Yankee.
Mr. Hewitt.
Only the good book tells me what is right to do.
Miss Hannah, I appoint you sergeant and second-in-command.
Pick yourself a couple of corporals.
Good.
Now, get those horses unhitched and put them in the corral.
Get your belongings inside the mission.
Well now, I sure wish you troopers a lot of luck.
Going somewhere, Kettle?
Maybe you do need a man around here.
At least I chose a side.
You heard the man.
Yeah, Mary...
Yeah.
All right, men, use your muscles.
Turn it over.
In there.
Push.
Push!
All right, Lieutenant, all right.
Ready, men?
One, two, three...
Heave!
Any three men, Lieutenant.
Any three men.
Yeah, well.
Target practice.
Good.
Hold it, hold it.
Get your head down so you can see that front sight.
You all right?
Better than any three men, Lieutenant, any three men.
Most any three men.
Hurry up, hurry up!
Prepare to move out, Sergeant.
Skirts!
Hup!
Tuck them in!
Tuck them in!
Ready!
Charge!
Heckles, get down.
Do it again.
And this time I want you to hit the ground so hard it splits wide open.
Oh.
Fall in!
On the double!
Brace your feet, girls.
Next!
Hold it!
Hold it.
Get over there, Martin.
All right.
Fast!
You see?
# Passing the water, darling
# Pass the bucket down the line
# Pass the bucket down the line...
Start on that one over there.
Sounds reasonable.
# Passing the water, darling
Here, my smelling salts.
Get back in line and keep that water moving.
How dare you talk to me like that.
Move!
You better rest for a while.
Sit here.
Just a little touch of sun.
Oh, Emmett, please marry me.
Look, I... told you.
Got to get inside or back behind the wall.
Behind the wall, men.
Behind the wall!
Now, get down.
Get down!
Throw all these pieces down the hole!
More salt.
We need bandages.
I had Hetty give up hers.
Take it off.
What?
Take it off right now.
How dare you?
H-H-Hetty?
If you were in South Carolina, Sir, you would be horse whipped!
# Let me introduce a lady, la-di-dah.
# La-di-dah, a lady with a very pompous air, la-di-dah.
# Her boots are fancy leather And her bonnet, they... #
We needed the petticoat.
La-di-dah.
Hi, Stell.
Sure.
What do you really think our chances are?
I know what this can be.
Frank, I told I got married a week after you went away.
Ask me why.
He is.
But ask me if I love him.
I guess I married him out of hurt and spite.
When I saw you come riding in, it was like a dam bursting inside me.
It let all my feelings loose.
Hey, Stella!
Stell!
What is it, Bax?
Sergeant Hannah needs you.
She wants you right away.
I made that up to make her go.
Now, mister.
At a no-good Yankee.
When my brother went away, he told me to look after her his wife.
We were just talking about Ed.
Out here?
Like that?
Depends.
You see, I already have a girl.
Which one of them is she?
Which one?
Well...
There she is now.
Bax, come back here!
Hello.
Ann Martin?
Yeah.
Sure.
Good night.
Put that gun away.
Look, what makes him so sure that Indians are between us and safety, huh?
Dora Hartley was pretty good proof.
We can make it easy if we travel light.
Load everyone in a couple of wagons, each takes two horses on behind, and when the first team gives out, we change over...
Simple?
Sergeant Lacey!
Sergeant Lacey!
What happened, Hewitt?
And what are you, huh?
Look, what I did was on account of Hewitt.
He drove off all the horses.
Did you?
Why?
Cos he was afraid some of us had slipped away and tell where he was hiding.
Last night, I heard Kettle trying to talk you into running away.
It sounded like you might decide to do it.
So you made up our minds for us.
Somebody had to.
Even if it might wipe us all out without giving us the right to decide for ourselves?
Right Danny, right but you notice he kept one horse for his own getaway.
That was for scouting.
Nothing else.
Oh, sure.
A likely story.
Ha!
Fine thing, you gotta believe a no-good turncoat.
Just a minute!
Right or wrong about the horses, Frank put himself into the same boat with the rest of us.
What do we do with that varmint?
Lock him up till the fighting starts.
All right.
Frank, look...
We can hope they head north.
Right.
Back to your posts, men.
Move along.
Move along!
Sentry?
All clear, Lieutenant.
Keep your eyes open.
What bad was that?
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you do that?
And your conscience tells you to turn traitor against your friends and neighbors, I suppose?
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.
Fine, Bax.
Bust up?
Bax, you better go see if the horses are all right.
You told him I was your girl?
Yeah, I...
I had to.
Why?
Oh, he saw me talking with Stella and he jumped to a conclusion.
Stella Leathem?
Oh, Ann.
Wait, Mary, wait, please!
Whatever happens Mary, I wanted you to know that I was wrong, so wrong.
No, I was wrong.
Right.
I guess maybe you were to have anything to do with a person like me.
I should never have believed...
Listen to me, Mary.
Listen.
Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.
And I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.
What suddenly makes you remember?
We being here, waiting to die.
We deserve to die!
I do Mary, I do but not you and the b...
Marriage?
Yes.
How?
No-one here can.
I know, darling, I know, but that horse... that horse will carry us to where there is one who can.
Oh, Emmett.
Could we?
Yes, darling.
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.
Oh...
The keys, darling.
Unlock the door...
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.
Your daughter ought to be in bed.
Come on, honey.
One way to find out - marry and settle down.
Me?
New country, new life.
Why not?
Why not?
I knew a shoemaker once who became a violinist.
Hell.
Emmett?
Emmett!
Help me, Hewitt!
Come back!
Come back!
Mary, what happened?
Oh, Emmett!
Kettle escaped.
No!
Help me, Cora.
No.
No.
You lied for her.
One question - why did you keep the horse here?
I might have been able to lead the Indians away before they spotted the place.
Maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Amigo, set up three more.
Well, come on!
Make it fast.
These mornings are terribly dry.
I think you are.
We lost the other one that way.
Tortilla missed.
I do sometimes.
Thank you.
Amigo, how much money you got?
What are you gonna do?
Come over here.
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Put your hands up!
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!
We find out
Let me get down, will ya?
Get them up!
Let me get down!
Now, there.
Now tell me, how much money you got?
None.
I told you, none.
Oh, amigo, I must shoot you for lying.
I...
Look, my pockets are empty.
Search.
No, look...
Tell your boys to stop this joke and put me down, you hear?
Look, supposing I... supposing I was to tell you where there was gold.
Cut me down.
He said where?
At the old mission, 12 hours west of here.
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?
They held me prisoner but I escaped.
They got jewels and gold there.
Women?
Supposing there is no gold?
There is!
And also Indians.
Oh, what are you scared of?
Unless amigo lies and there is no women.
Then we come back to him and complain.
Keep amigo here?
Look, I want my share of the gold too.
Are you sure?
No.
About the gold?
No.
Or the women?
No, I...
No.
Oh, no.
No!
Please!
N...
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Sergeant Hannah!
Sergeant Hannah!
Yes?
Indians!
Everybody to their posts!
Get the Lieutenant.
Hurry, Indians!
Is everybody at their posts?
Yes.
Well, get to yours.
Well, open the door.
Well, welcome, men.
Well, you heard what the ladies said, boys.
Correct.
Indians?
DOITtjOSh.
We could sure use three more guns.
Hey, where did you get that horse?
Well, he sent us in his place.
He say that you need help here pretty bad.
Three for one.
What are you talking about?
Now, get!
These are women?
Get going, buster.
Frank!
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.
Tonight will be different story.
Look!
Whoa!
Hyah!
Please!
No, no.
We like Indians.
One Of you talk English?
Si, amigos.
My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.
It was not a fly.
Honest.
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...
Big like a mountain.
Hey amigo, maybe you interested in white women who brought the gold and the jewels.
Ah, Chihuahua!
Beautiful, everyone.
And a pony soldier.
Chivington.
Where?
The medicine man is a man of his word?
Yes?
No?
Where?
There.
Back there.
The mission.
You lie.
No, amigo.
To prove to you that we are honest, we will stay here and wait for you.
Si?
After all, we are entitled to a share of the gold, huh?
You honest, you come with us.
Back to your posts.
No, no, wait.
We gotta take a gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.
Roof?
What do you mean?
Move!
Hurry up!
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!
Leave the door!
Go up!
No-one is to move or talk.
One call could decide whether we stay alive or not.
Where people?
Well, they gotta be there.
Yeah.
The Lord is my strength, my rock...
No women, no water.
But they got to be.
They were all around.
We talked to them right here.
Chief!
I know...
Frank, what have I done?
Could have happened to anyone, Bax.
Get to your posts!
Bax, look after the children.
You can shoot, get over there.
You will obey if I have to drag you over there.
What are they doing?
Waiting for the Medicine Man to tell them if the signs are in their favor.
Hold your fire McCasslin, they are out of range.
They just want us to get scared and use our ammunition.
This is it!
Let them come into the yard before you shoot.
Now!
Get them.
Get down!
It does.
Hold your fire!
Martin, get those outposts in.
Lieutenant, the Lord was plain enough in His commands about violence and bloodshed.
Go to the other side!
Get below!
Martin, Lacey, see if you can get some fire in there.
Is she dead?
She was guilty.
She was stained with the mark of sinners.
Shut up!
Come on, get her below, quick.
Mary.
Oh...
What are you standing around here for?
Did you think it was gonna be a picnic?
Sergeant, take care of her.
What does it look like out there, Gibbons?
Put her over there.
Mama!
Talk to me, Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Mama.
Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
I wanna stay here with my Mama, please.
You come with Lucy, huh?
Lucy, I...
Forget it.
I...
Thank you.
How many casualties?
Three dead - quite a few nicks.
It could have been worse.
What happens now?
We wait until the Medicine Man says a few prayers to decide when to attack again.
How will we know?
# Them golden steps of gold
Cut the request, we need all the rest we can get.
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Right.
You did right.
How are you holding up, McCasslin?
Just tired.
I...
Go get some rest.
Thanks.
Frank.
Stella, listen...
Jones, take over here.
You better get some sleep.
Stop treating me like a child.
I treat you all the same.
Except Stella Leatham.
No.
If you can fool a young boy like Bax, cue stoop to lie about me...
Scared, Ann?
We all are, you know.
Oh?
What, then?
The love bug bite you?
No!
Oh, to be young and not know the source of your troubles.
Hear, now.
If you love him, you help him.
Men gather around a minute, I want to talk to you.
He ought to be back in the army, always shouting, shouting orders.
Trying not to show it.
Now good soldiers are entitled to the truth.
We can stay here till they burn us out or we can carry the fight to them.
Why, Lieutenant?
What happened?
Him!
That Medicine Man.
I got so damn mad at him for asking his god about killing more of us, that I loaded up old Betsy with five times her regular...
Oh, look at her.
Five times?
He is?
They always keep their Medicine Man well out of range.
Well, guess I was just hoping for a miracle.
Miracle huh?
Yeah, I...
Huh?
Sure you can hit these things?
You trying to get yourself killed?
Obey orders.
All right, men.
Back to the fort.
Time for what?
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.
You know with any luck, I think we might have been friends.
Maybe more than that.
How does it look, Sergeant?
Good luck.
Now, put your sights on them bombs and squeeze gently.
Frank is running away!
Fire!
Did he make it?
Yes.
Go with the other children.
I wish to help fight like a man.
No, Bax.
Do as I tell you.
No!
You got no right to say no after what I did.
You take that last window.
Guard that window!
We make a great team, Hetty.
Hetty!
And shooting too.
Look!
Look!
Shut up!
Bax!
How are you?
Oh, Bax!
Cora, what are you doing?
Let go!
Ammunition.
Go easy.
We only have a little left.
This thing is stuck.
Ammunition!
Ammunition!
Ammunition over here.
Drag him over to the front.
When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
There it is.
Give me a hand with this rope.
Open the door!
If superstitution runs true to form, this ought to do it.
Yippee!
We whipped them!
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
Ann?
Yes?
I have to go away for a while.
But I go remembering that, with any luck, we might have been more than friends.
Then why go?
The defendant will step forward and face the court.
The court has carefully weighed the evidence which has been presented by the Prosecution and the Defence and it is the unanimous verdict of this court...
Ten-shun!
At ease, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged with insubordination and desertion.
Er... where did you apprehend him?
Oh, he came back voluntarily but with the wildest story ever dreamed by men of having ridden to Texas, rallied a bunch of women and fought off an Indian attack.
That was no story.
The defendant will remain silent.
The General may be interested to know that Yellow Horse and Broken Foot were brought in three days ago.
True, they admitted having been in a fight.
And a fight with buffalo hunters, not some imaginery petticoat brigade.
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone of you!
Stand easy boys.
Colonel, this is that phantom Petticoat army you spoke about.
Incidentally, six of the best marksmen you ever saw.
Hold it, Lacey.
You women clear out of here before I have you driven out.
The good Lord let me know if something worth fighting for, a body better fight.
Sergeant Lebbard, have the bugler sound assembly.
Can we have a truce?
The evidence is overwhelming, and I might add some of it downright attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, your testimony will be required at the trial of Colonel Chivington in the matter of the Sand Creek massacre.
Colonel return to your quarters.
Stella wanted me to tell you that she took your advice and stayed behind to wait for her husband.
Lieutenant, thank you and God bless you.
That was for the slap, Frank.
I made a good trade, McCasslin.
Thanks again.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Nancy.
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy to be a real lady.
Good luck.
And good luck to you too.
Peace.
You are far from the reservation.
We carry no arms.
No guns, no bows and arrows.
In the north, ranches were burned, people murdered.
We search for those who did this.
To the south we trade with our brothers.
In peace we return to our farms and women.
Next time, obey the treaty.
The Colonel will be disappointed to have nobody to shoot at.
Yeah.
Come in.
Lieutenant Hewitt is here, sir.
Send him in.
Lieutenant?
Welcome back, Hewitt.
Thank you, Captain.
What did you find?
We ran across a band of Cheyenne.
But not the renegades we want.
How do you know?
They came from the south.
They were unarmed.
But they were illegally off the reservation.
They said it was a trading mission.
Have the bugler sound assembly.
Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do?
Teach them a lesson.
Double the ammunition ration.
Yes, sir.
Dismissed.
I preserve treaties and keep the peace.
I said you were dismissed.
Every other tribe - the Paiute, the Comanche - will use it as an excuse to join the Cheyenne on the warpath.
Not with me here to stop them.
And south of here?
South?
Texas, sir.
A man fights for what he thinks is right.
One of us is dressed wrong, Colonel.
Did you hear what he said?
I got ears.
Well, remember it.
Lebbard?
Yes, sir?
See this gets to General Firewell.
What are you gonna do?
Charge!
This is the Texas border.
I know.
Have you had any Indian trouble here?
This far south?
What for?
Do you ask everyone the same thing?
I am from Texas.
In that uniform?
Better hold him.
Here, use these.
They were after guns and ammunition.
Here.
Where are you going, mister?
Yeah.
Till you get what you were after.
Thanks.
I sent for the doctor.
Try this.
I have got people to talk to.
Folks is sensitive to that colour around here.
Say, just exactly what are you?
From which side?
Both, I suppose.
Hey, Stellal
Maybe.
Go back to the house.
Go on.
Mind me!
Hi, Stella.
So did I.
No, Stella.
In fact, I deserted.
Wait a minute...
Wait?
Am I supposed to wait forever?
Let me tell you - one week after you left, I got married.
To a good man, too.
Ed Leathem.
Two weeks ago there was a massacre of Cheyenne at Sand Creek.
My regiment did it.
Now the Indians are on their way.
Indians.
You made that up fast
Get off my land.
Stella, wait!
Your best chance is at the mission.
Damn Yankee!
Get her there, Bax.
Damn Yankee!
Hello, Miss Hannah.
Frank Hewitt.
The Comanches are on their way.
I only want to help.
Listen?
Now, you listen.
Our menfolk are fighting your kind.
Get going before you need patches on them blue breeches.
No more trouble out of you, now.
Who are you?
Ann Martin.
Indians are on the warpath.
I want you to get to the mission as fast as you can.
Now, you start running.
Ann, your father and I were friends.
Keep moving, Yankee.
You get!
Nor did I. So maybe this will help.
Dora Hartley.
The way the Comanches left her.
You had to be shown.
There are things to do.
Most merciful Father, who has been pleased to take unto Thyself the soul of this, thy servant, Dora Hartley, grant unto us, who are still in our pilgrimage, who walk as yet by faith,
that we may join Thy blessed saints hereafter in glory everlasting.
# You pass by my door, a singer, a song
Good afternoon.
How do you do?
La-di-dah.
Are you ladies from around here?
Certainly not.
The first thing I wish to make clear is that I am not with this... this...
Er, creature?
Thank you.
Our driver left two days ago to find a new wagon when we broke down.
You did right.
Put a wheel on this vehicle, and we shall be on our way.
Indians?
Men Indians?
You might as well alight.
Indians!
Indians!
Get down over there!
You should have seen yourselves.
You, too, yellow-liv...
Stand easy, son.
I thought you should hear the sound of the only Indian within 100 miles.
Or maybe you believe your tall tale.
She was killed by a stray.
By the time you ladies made up your minds, the Comanches could have closed off the valley.
I say we stay here.
All of us.
How many ladies know how to shoot?
You can put your hand up.
I can shoot good, damn Yankee.
Mr Hewitt.
Only the Good Book tells me what is right to do.
Miss Hannah, I appoint you sergeant and second-in-command.
Pick a couple of corporals.
Ann Martin and Stella Leathem.
Good.
Now, get those horses unhitched and put them in the corral.
Get your things inside the mission.
I sure wish you troopers luck.
Going somewhere, Kettle?
Maybe you do need a man around here.
At least I chose a side.
You heard the man.
Yeah, Mary...
Yeah.
All right, men, use your muscles.
Turn it over.
In there.
Push.
Push!
All right, Lieutenant, all right.
Ready, men?
One, two, three...
Heave!
Any three men, Lieutenant.
Yeah, well.
Target practice.
Good.
Hold it, hold it.
Get your head down so you can see that front sight.
Are you all right?
Better than any three men, Lieutenant, any three men.
Most any three men.
Hurry up, hurry up!
Prepare to move out, Sergeant.
Skirts!
Up!
Tuck them in!
Tuck them in!
Ready!
Charge!
Heckles, get down.
The back of your lap is a hard place to tie a bandage.
This time I want you to hit that ground so hard it splits wide open.
Oh.
Fall in!
On the double!
Next!
Hold it!
Hold it.
Get over there, Martin.
All right.
Fast.
You see?
# Passing the water, darling
# Pass the bucket down the line
# Pass the bucket down the line...
Start on that one over there.
Sounds reasonable.
# Passing the water, darling
Hetty, my smelling salts.
Keep that water moving.
How dare you talk to me like that.
Move!
Sit here.
Just a little touch of sun.
Oh, Emmett, please marry me.
Look, I... told you.
Get inside or back behind the wall.
Behind the wall, men.
Now, get down.
Get down!
Throw all these pieces down the hole!
More salt.
We need bandages.
I had Hetty give up hers.
Take it off.
What?
Take it off right now.
How dare you?
H-h-hetty?
If you were in South Carolina, sir, you would be horsewhipped.
Let me introduce a lady, la-di-dah.
La-di-dah, a lady with a very pompous air, la-di-dah.
# Her boots are fancy leather And her bonnet... #
We needed the petticoat.
La-di-dah.
Hi, Stell.
Sure.
What do you really think our chances are?
I know what this can be.
Frank, I said I got married a week after you went away.
Ask me why.
He is.
But ask me if I love him.
I married him out of hurt and spite.
When I saw you come riding in, it was like a dam bursting.
It let all my feelings loose.
Hey, Stella!
Stella!
What is it, Bax?
Sergeant Hannah needs you.
She wants you right away.
I made that up to make her go.
Now, mister.
Careful where you point that gun.
My brother told me to look after her
We were just talking about Ed.
Out here?
Like that?
Depends.
See, I already have a girl.
Which one is she?
Which one?
Well...
There she is now.
Come back here!
Hello.
Ann Martin?
Yeah.
Sure.
Good night.
Put that gun away.
Look, what makes him so sure that Indians are between us and safety?
Dora Hartley was pretty good proof.
We can make it easy if we travel light.
Load everyone in a couple of wagons, stick two horses on behind, and when one team gives out, change over.
Simple?
Sergeant Lacey!
Sergeant Lacey!
What happened, Hewitt?
And what are you?
Hewitt drove off all the horses.
Did you?
Why?
I heard Kettle trying to talk you into running away.
Sounded like you might.
So you made up our minds for us.
Somebody had to.
Without letting us decide for ourselves.
But he kept one horse for his own getaway.
That was for scouting.
Oh, sure.
A likely story.
Ha!
Fine thing to have to believe a turncoat.
Just a minute!
Frank stayed with the rest of us.
What about that varmint?
Lock him up till the fighting starts.
All right.
Frank, look.
We can hope they head north.
Right.
Back to your posts, men.
Move along.
Move along!
Sentry?
All clear, Lieutenant.
Keep your eyes open.
What bad was that?
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you?
I have to live with my conscience.
And it makes you turn traitor against friends and neighbours?
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.
Bust up?
Bax, see if the horses are all right.
You told him I was your girl?
Yeah, I...
I had to.
Why?
He saw me with Stella and jumped to a conclusion.
Stella Leathem?
Oh, Ann.
Wait, Mary, please!
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I was wrong, so wrong.
No, I was wrong.
I guess maybe you were to have anything to do with me.
I should never have believed...
Listen to me, please.
Listen.
Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.
I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.
What makes you remember now?
Being here, waiting to die.
We deserve to die!
I do, but not you and the b...
Marriage?
Yes.
How?
No-one here can.
I know, darling, I know, but that horse will carry us to where there is one who can.
Oh, Emmett.
Could we?
Yes, darling.
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.
Oh...
The keys, darling.
Unlock the door.
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.
Conover and Gibbons, gardening time.
Your daughter ought to be in bed.
Come on, honey.
One way to find out - marry and settle down.
Me?
New country, new life.
Why not?
Why not?
I knew a shoemaker once who became a violinist.
Hell.
Emmett?
Emmett!
Help me, please!
Come back!
Come back!
Mary, what happened?
Oh, Emmett!
Kettle escaped.
She tried to stop him
No!
Help me, Cora.
No.
No.
You lied for her.
One question - why did you keep the horse here?
Maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Amigo, set up three more.
Well, come on!
Make it fast.
These mornings are terribly dry.
I think you are.
We lost the other one.
Tortilla missed.
I do sometimes.
Thank you.
Amigo, how much money you got?
What are you gonna do?
Come over here.
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Put your arms up!
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!
We find out
Let me get down, will ya?
Get them up!
Let me get down!
Now, there.
Tell me, how much money you got?
None.
I told you, none.
Oh, amigo, I must shoot you for lying.
I...
Look, my pockets are empty.
Search.
No, look...
Will you tell your boys to stop this joke and cut me down?
If you have no money, he has to.
Look, supposing I... supposing I was to tell you where there was gold.
Cut me down.
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?
They held me prisoner, I escaped.
They got jewels and gold there.
Women?
Supposing there is no gold?
There is!
And also Indians.
Unless he lies and there is no women
Then we come back and complain.
Keep amigo here?
Look, I want my share of the gold, too.
No.
About the gold?
No.
Or the women?
No, I...
No.
Oh, no.
No!
Please!
N...
Or women.
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Sergeant Hannah!
Sergeant Hannah!
Yes?
Indians!
Everybody to their posts!
Get the Lieutenant.
Hurry, Indians!
Is everybody at their posts?
Yes.
Well, get to yours.
Well, open the door.
Well, welcome, men.
You heard, boys.
Correct.
Indians?
We could sure use three more guns.
He sent us in his place.
He say you need help here pretty bad.
Three for one.
We only interested in two things.
What are you talking about?
Now, get!
These are women?
Get going, buster.
Frank!
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.
Look!
Whoa!
Hyah!
Peace!
No, no.
We like Indians.
One of you talk English?
Si, amigos.
My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.
It was not a fly.
Honest
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...
Big, like a mountain.
Amigo, maybe you interested in white women who brought the gold.
Ah, Chihuahua!
Beautiful, every one.
And a pony soldier.
Chivington.
Where?
The medicine man is a man of his word?
Yes?
No?
Where?
There.
Back there.
The mission.
You lie.
No, amigo.
To prove that we are honest, we will stay here and wait for you.
Si?
We are entitled to some of the gold.
You honest, you come with us.
Back to your posts.
Wait.
We gotta gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.
Roof?
Move!
Hurry up!
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!
Leave them open!
Go up!
No-one moves or talks.
One call could decide whether we stay alive or not.
Where people?
Well, they gotta be there.
Yeah.
The Lord is my strength, my rock...
No women, no water.
But they got to be.
They were all around.
We talked to them.
Chief!
I know...
I knew if I prayed there would be no killing.
We sure fooled them.
Frank, what have I done?
Coulda happened to anyone.
Get to your posts.
Bax, look after the children.
You can shoot, get over there.
You will obey if I have to drag you over there.
What are they doing?
Let them come into the yard before you shoot.
Now!
Get them.
Get down!
It does.
Hold your fire!
Martin, get those outposts in.
The Lord was plain in His commands about violence and bloodshed.
Go to the other side!
Get below!
Martin, Lacey, see if you can get some fire in there.
Is she dead?
She was guilty.
She was stained with the mark of sinners.
Shut upl
Come on, get her below, quick.
Mary.
Oh...
What are you standing around for?
Did you think it would be a picnic?
Sergeant, take care of her.
Put her over there.
Mama!
Talk to me, Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Mama.
Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
I wanna stay by Mama, please.
You come with Lucy, huh?
Lucy, I...
Forget it.
I...
Thank you.
How many casualties?
Two dead.
Quite a few nicks.
It could have been worse.
What happens now?
We wait until the medicine man says a prayer to decide when to attack.
How will we know?
# Them golden slippers, gold
Conover, we need what rest we can get
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank!
Hold it!
Right.
You did right.
How are you holding up?
Just tired.
Get some rest.
Thanks.
Frank.
Stella, listen...
And wait.
Jones, take over here.
Get some sleep.
Stop treating me like a child.
I treat you all the same.
Except Stella.
No.
If you can fool a boy like Bax, if you can lie about me...
Scared, Ann?
We all are, you know.
Oh?
What, then?
The love bug bite you?
No!
Oh, to be young and not know the source of your troubles.
Hear, now.
If you love him, you help him.
Men, I want to talk to you.
He ought to be back in the army, always shouting, shouting orders.
Trying not to show it.
Good soldiers ought to know the truth
We can let them burn us out or carry the fight to them.
Why?
What happened?
Him!
That medicine man.
I got so mad at him for asking his god about killing more of us, that I loaded up old Betsy with five times her...
Oh, look at her.
Five times?
He is?
Guns work for 300 yards at best They keep the medicine man out of range.
Well, I guess I was just hoping for a miracle.
Yeah, I...
Huh?
Sure you can hit these things?
Are you trying to get killed?
Obey orders.
All right, men.
Back to the fort.
Time for what?
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.
With any luck, I think we might have been friends.
Maybe more than that.
How does it look, Sergeant?
They look upset about something.
Good luck.
Now, put your sights on them bombs and squeeze gently.
Frank is running away!
Fire!
Did he make it?
Yes.
Go with the other children.
No, Bax.
Do as I tell you.
No!
You got no right to say no after what I did.
Take that last window.
Guard that window!
We make a great team, Hetty.
Hetty!
And shooting, too.
Look!
Look!
Shut up!
Bax!
How are you?
Oh, Bax!
Cora, what are you doing?
Let go!
Ammunition.
Go easy.
We only have a little left.
This thing is stuck.
Ammunition!
Ammunition!
Ammunition over here.
Drag him over to the front.
When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
There it is.
Give me a hand with this rope.
Open the doors!
If superstitions run true to form then this ought to do it.
We whipped them!
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
Ann?
I have to go away for a while.
I go remembering that, with any luck, we might have been more than friends.
Then why go?
The defendant will step forward and face the court.
The court has weighed the evidence presented by the prosecution and defence.
The unanimous verdict...
Ten-shun!
At ease, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged with insubordination and desertion.
Where did you apprehend him?
He came back voluntarily but with a wild story of rallying a bunch of women in Texas and fighting off Indians.
That was no story.
The defendant will remain silent.
Yellow Horse and Broken Foot were brought in three days ago.
They did admit to being in a fight.
With buffalo hunters, not some petticoat brigade.
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone!
Stand easy.
Colonel, this is that phantom petticoat army.
Incidentally, six of the best marksmen you ever saw.
Hold it, Lacey.
Clear out before I drive you out.
Sergeant Lebbard, have the bugler sound assembly.
The South has counterattacked.
The reports I have received prove that the wrong man has been on trial
The evidence is overwhelming, and some of it downright attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, we will need you at the trial of Colonel Chivington for the Sand Creek massacre.
Stella took your advice and stayed behind to wait for her husband.
Lieutenant, thank you and God bless you.
That was for the slap, Frank.
I made a good trade.
Thanks again.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Nancy.
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy to be a real lady, to square things.
Good luck.
And good luck to you, too.
Peace.
You are far from the reservation.

Sergeant Lacey!
What happened, Hewitt?
And what are you?
Hewitt drove off all the horses.
Did you?
Why?
I heard Kettle trying to talk you into running away.
Sounded like you might.
So you made up our minds for us.
Somebody had to.
Without letting us decide for ourselves.
But he kept one horse for his own getaway.
That was for scouting.
Oh, sure.
A likely story.
Ha!
Fine thing to have to believe a turncoat.
Just a minute!
Frank stayed with the rest of us.
What about that varmint?
Lock him up till the fighting starts.
All right.
Frank, look.
We can hope they head north.
Right.
Back to your posts, men.
Move along.
Move along!
Sentry?
All clear, Lieutenant.
Keep your eyes open.
What bad was that?
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you?
I have to live with my conscience.
And it makes you turn traitor against friends and neighbours?
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.
Bust up?
Bax, see if the horses are all right.
You told him I was your girl?
Yeah, I...
I had to.
Why?
He saw me with Stella and jumped to a conclusion.
Stella Leathem?
Oh, Ann.
Wait, Mary, please!
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I was wrong, so wrong.
No, I was wrong.
I guess maybe you were to have anything to do with me.
I should never have believed...
Listen to me, please.
Listen.
Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.
I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.
What makes you remember now?
Being here, waiting to die.
We deserve to die!
I do, but not you and the b...
Marriage?
Yes.
How?
No-one here can.
I know, darling, I know, but that horse will carry us to where there is one who can.
Oh, Emmett.
Could we?
Yes, darling.
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.
Oh...
The keys, darling.
Unlock the door.
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.
Conover and Gibbons, gardening time.
Your daughter ought to be in bed.
Come on, honey.
One way to find out - marry and settle down.
Me?
New country, new life.
Why not?
Why not?
I knew a shoemaker once who became a violinist.
Hell.
Emmett?
Emmett!
Help me, please!
Come back!
Come back!
Mary, what happened?
Oh, Emmett!
Kettle escaped.
She tried to stop him
No!
Help me, Cora.
No.
No.
You lied for her.
One question - why did you keep the horse here?
Maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Amigo, set up three more.
Well, come on!
Make it fast.
These mornings are terribly dry.
I think you are.
We lost the other one.
Tortilla missed.
I do sometimes.
Thank you.
Amigo, how much money you got?
What are you gonna do?
Come over here.
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Put your arms up!
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!
We find out
Let me get down, will ya?
Get them up!
Let me get down!
Now, there.
Tell me, how much money you got?
None.
I told you, none.
Oh, amigo, I must shoot you for lying.
I...
Look, my pockets are empty.
Search.
No, look...
Will you tell your boys to stop this joke and cut me down?
If you have no money, he has to.
Look, supposing I... supposing I was to tell you where there was gold.
Cut me down.
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?
They held me prisoner, I escaped.
They got jewels and gold there.
Women?
Supposing there is no gold?
There is!
And also Indians.
Unless he lies and there is no women
Then we come back and complain.
Keep amigo here?
Look, I want my share of the gold, too.
No.
About the gold?
No.
Or the women?
No, I...
No.
Oh, no.
No!
Please!
N...
Or women.
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Sergeant Hannah!
Sergeant Hannah!
Yes?
Indians!
Everybody to their posts!
Get the Lieutenant.
Hurry, Indians!
Is everybody at their posts?
Yes.
Well, get to yours.
Well, open the door.
Well, welcome, men.
You heard, boys.
Correct.
Indians?
We could sure use three more guns.
He sent us in his place.
He say you need help here pretty bad.
Three for one.
We only interested in two things.
What are you talking about?
Now, get!
These are women?
Get going, buster.
Frank!
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.
Look!
Whoa!
Hyah!
Peace!
No, no.
We like Indians.
One of you talk English?
Si, amigos.
My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.
It was not a fly.
Honest
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...
Big, like a mountain.
Amigo, maybe you interested in white women who brought the gold.
Ah, Chihuahua!
Beautiful, every one.
And a pony soldier.
Chivington.
Where?
The medicine man is a man of his word?
Yes?
No?
Where?
There.
Back there.
The mission.
You lie.
No, amigo.
To prove that we are honest, we will stay here and wait for you.
Si?
We are entitled to some of the gold.
You honest, you come with us.
Back to your posts.
Wait.
We gotta gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.
Roof?
Move!
Hurry up!
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!
Leave them open!
Go up!
No-one moves or talks.
One call could decide whether we stay alive or not.
Where people?
Well, they gotta be there.
Yeah.
The Lord is my strength, my rock...
No women, no water.
But they got to be.
They were all around.
We talked to them.
Chief!
I know...
I knew if I prayed there would be no killing.
We sure fooled them.
Frank, what have I done?
Coulda happened to anyone.
Get to your posts.
Bax, look after the children.
You can shoot, get over there.
You will obey if I have to drag you over there.
What are they doing?
Let them come into the yard before you shoot.
Now!
Get them.
Get down!
It does.
Hold your fire!
Martin, get those outposts in.
The Lord was plain in His commands about violence and bloodshed.
Go to the other side!
Get below!
Martin, Lacey, see if you can get some fire in there.
Is she dead?
She was guilty.
She was stained with the mark of sinners.
Shut upl
Come on, get her below, quick.
Mary.
Oh...
What are you standing around for?
Did you think it would be a picnic?
Sergeant, take care of her.
Put her over there.
Mama!
Talk to me, Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Mama.
Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
I wanna stay by Mama, please.
You come with Lucy, huh?
Lucy, I...
Forget it.
I...
Thank you.
How many casualties?
Two dead.
Quite a few nicks.
It could have been worse.
What happens now?
We wait until the medicine man says a prayer to decide when to attack.
How will we know?
# Them golden slippers, gold
Conover, we need what rest we can get
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank!
Hold it!
Right.
You did right.
How are you holding up?
Just tired.
Get some rest.
Thanks.
Frank.
Stella, listen...
And wait.
Jones, take over here.
Get some sleep.
Stop treating me like a child.
I treat you all the same.
Except Stella.
No.
If you can fool a boy like Bax, if you can lie about me...
Scared, Ann?
We all are, you know.
Oh?
What, then?
The love bug bite you?
No!
Oh, to be young and not know the source of your troubles.
Hear, now.
If you love him, you help him.
Men, I want to talk to you.
He ought to be back in the army, always shouting, shouting orders.
Trying not to show it.
Good soldiers ought to know the truth
We can let them burn us out or carry the fight to them.
Why?
What happened?
Him!
That medicine man.
I got so mad at him for asking his god about killing more of us, that I loaded up old Betsy with five times her...
Oh, look at her.
Five times?
He is?
Guns work for 300 yards at best They keep the medicine man out of range.
Well, I guess I was just hoping for a miracle.
Yeah, I...
Huh?
Sure you can hit these things?
Are you trying to get killed?
Obey orders.
All right, men.
Back to the fort.
Time for what?
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.
With any luck, I think we might have been friends.
Maybe more than that.
How does it look, Sergeant?
They look upset about something.
Good luck.
Now, put your sights on them bombs and squeeze gently.
Frank is running away!
Fire!
Did he make it?
Yes.
Go with the other children.
No, Bax.
Do as I tell you.
No!
You got no right to say no after what I did.
Take that last window.
Guard that window!
We make a great team, Hetty.
Hetty!
And shooting, too.
Look!
Look!
Shut up!
Bax!
How are you?
Oh, Bax!
Cora, what are you doing?
Let go!
Ammunition.
Go easy.
We only have a little left.
This thing is stuck.
Ammunition!
Ammunition!
Ammunition over here.
Drag him over to the front.
When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
There it is.
Give me a hand with this rope.
Open the doors!
If superstitions run true to form then this ought to do it.
We whipped them!
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
Ann?
I have to go away for a while.
I go remembering that, with any luck, we might have been more than friends.
Then why go?
The defendant will step forward and face the court.
The court has weighed the evidence presented by the prosecution and defence.
The unanimous verdict...
Ten-shun!
At ease, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged with insubordination and desertion.
Where did you apprehend him?
He came back voluntarily but with a wild story of rallying a bunch of women in Texas and fighting off Indians.
That was no story.
The defendant will remain silent.
Yellow Horse and Broken Foot were brought in three days ago.
They did admit to being in a fight.
With buffalo hunters, not some petticoat brigade.
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone!
Stand easy.
Colonel, this is that phantom petticoat army.
Incidentally, six of the best marksmen you ever saw.
Hold it, Lacey.
Clear out before I drive you out.
Sergeant Lebbard, have the bugler sound assembly.
The South has counterattacked.
The reports I have received prove that the wrong man has been on trial
The evidence is overwhelming, and some of it downright attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, we will need you at the trial of Colonel Chivington for the Sand Creek massacre.
Stella took your advice and stayed behind to wait for her husband.
Lieutenant, thank you and God bless you.
That was for the slap, Frank.
I made a good trade.
Thanks again.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Nancy.
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy to be a real lady, to square things.
Good luck.
And good luck to you, too.

EDWARD R. MURROW:
This is the result of panic, the blind unreasoning terror of men who run and do not truly know what they are fleeing.
And this is the factual story of such a panic.
First, it was a year in which the nations of the world, at peace for almost 20 years, had recently seen shattered their comfortable illusion of security.
2,000 miles away, across an ocean now realized to be no longer a safeguard against invasion, the arrogant demands of a power hungry dictator had short weeks before forced haughty Britain and proud
France to agree to the humiliating peace of Munich.
Thus, point one.
But world events had left men shaken and unsure.
Hence, open to emotional attack against their reason, against their intelligence, and their logic.
For October 30 was that mysterious night when dark tradition tells us fiends and demons walked the whims of the world.
The one night of the year when even sensible men believe that almost anything can happen, the eve of Halloween, 1938.
And in a radio studio of the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City, the actors and staff of the Mercury Theatre on the air were putting the final touches to what was frankly a terror tale, which was to go on the air within a few short minutes.
We see them now in the final moments of rehearsal with their director.
Hey, fellas, hold it will ya please?
Hold it down over there.
Thanks.

Radio Network consisted of 110 affiliated stations in 44 states.
There was practically no sizable community in America which could not be reached by CBS broadcast.
Thus, from Maine to California and from Canada to the Gulf, listeners were tuned to the Mercury Theatre on that fateful night In the eastern United States, the area closest to the scene of fictitious peril, reaction
was most vivid and violent.
Everywhere emotions and reactions were the same.
Panic struck universally out of the dark but peaceful sky on a night that began quietly enough.

RADIO BROADCASTER:
the government meteorological bureau--
RADIO BROADCASTER:
of the country to keep an astronomical watch on and further disturbances occurring on the planet Mars.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Due to the unusual nature of this occurence, we have arranged an interview with a noted astronomer, Professor Pearson, who will give us his views on the subject.
Observatory at Princeton, New Jersey.
We return you, until then, to the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.
Will you turn that off?
Cigarette?
Thank you.
Just look out there.
Look at those stars, they look so close.
You feel like you can just reach right up and touch them.
Do you want a handful?
Mary?
What do you say?
Shall we?
Tonight, right now.
We--
New Jersey.
It is reported that at 8:50 PM, a huge flaming object believed to be a meteorite, fell on a farm in the neighborhood of Grovers Mill, New Jersey 22 miles from Trenton.
The flash in the sky was visible within a radius of several hundred miles.
And the noise of the impact was heard as far north as Elizabeth.
We have dispatched a special mobile unit to the scene and will have our commentator, Mr. Phillips, give you a word description as soon as he reach there from Princeton.
In the meantime, we take you to Hotel Marinet in Brooklyn where Bobby Millette and his orchestra are offering a program of dance music.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
We take you now to Grovers Mill.
PHILLIPS
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Carl Phillips again at the Wilmot farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey.
Professor Pearson and myself may be 11 miles from Princeton in just 10 minutes.
Well, I-
Must have struck with terrific force.
The-- the ground is covered with splinters of a tree it must have struck on the way down.
It looks, well, it looks more like a huge cylinder.
The color is sort of yellowish white.
Curious spectators now are pressing close to the object in spite of the efforts of the police to keep them back.
One man wants to touch the thing.
And The policeman wins.
Listen.
Do you hear it?
Here we are.
Can you hear it now?
Oh, hello, Molly.
The radio?
What?
Well, just for a minute, perhaps.
Thanks Molly.
The thing is smooth and as you can see of cylindrical shape.
Just a minute.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is terrific.
This end of the thing is beginning to flake off.
The top is beginning to rotate like-- like a screw.
The thing must be hollow.
Wa-
Are they eyes?
I-- it might be a face.
They look like tentacles to me.
I can hardly force myself to keep looking at it.
The eyes are black.
Listen.
Listen.
Riffleless lips that seem to quiver and pulsate.
The monster, or whatever it is, can hardly move.
It seems weighted down by, well, by possibly--
City desk.
A what?
Wait a minute.
Hey, Johnny you got anything on the wire about a meteor falling in New Jersey?
Nothing at all.
What do you suppose is ailing her?
Boy, people.
For instance, the officers on duty at the state police and fire dispatchers office in Trenton, New Jersey.
Sir, there is no Grovers Mill in New Jersey.
You better check.
State Police.
Meanwhile a counter interlude.
We now return you to Carl Phillips at Grovers Mill.
Ladies and gentleman, ah-- am I on?
Form here, I get a sweep of the whole scene.
More state police have arrived.
No, Sire, we have no information on that yet.
The state cops are out there now.
The captain and two policemen advance with something in their hands.
Yes, I can see it now.
It those creatures know what that means, what-- what anything means.
A humped shape is rising out of the pit.
I can make out a small beam of light against a mirror.
It strikes them head on.
Evidently there is some difficulty with our field transmission.
However, we will return you to that spot at the earliest opportunity.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
In the meantime--
I gotta a car.
Come on, come on.
We gotta get down there.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been handed a message that came from Grovers Mill by telephone.
Ah-- just a moment.
Speak up.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
At least 40 people, including six state troopers, lie dead in a field east of Grovers Mill.
Their bodies burned and distorted beyond all possible recognition.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next voice you hear will be that of Brigadier General Montgomery Smith,
Commander of the state militia at Trenton, New Jersey.
Four companies of state militia are proceeding from Trenton to Grovers Mill and will aid in the evacuation of homes within the range of military operations.
Thank you.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
You have just listening to General Montgomery Smith.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Grovers Mill are coming in.
The strange creatures are--
RADIO BROADCASTER:
The efforts of the firemen.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Combined fire departments from
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Mercer County are fighting the flames, which menace the entire countryside.
We have been unable to establish any contact with our mobile unit at Grover Mill.
But we hope to be able to return you there at the earliest possible moment.
Something moving, solid metal, kind of a shield like affair rising up out of the cylinder.
Hold on.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make.
Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our own eyes lead to the inescapable assumption that these strange beings that landed in New Jersey farmlands tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars.
Bob!
Bob!
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.
The Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations, the newspapers, the police and fire departments of the whole nation all are being deluged by a Niagara of calls from frenzied listeners who believe the radio drama to be the real thing.
More than a million listeners from Coast to Coast are caught in the grip of a contagious mass hysteria.
And they flee in terror from an incredible bogeymen, mythical invaders from the planet Mars.

We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed the Columbia Broadcasting System.
So, good bye everybody, and remember please, for the next day or so, the terrible lesson you learned tonight.
That grinning, glowing, globular invader of your living room is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch.
We were too busy listening.
Oh, you kids have got a lot to learn.
RADIO BROADCASTER:
This is CBS, the Columbia
Broadcasting System.
For the listeners who tuned in to the Mercury Theatre on the air broadcast tonight and did not realize that the program was merely a radio adaptation of H.
we are repeating the fact, made clear four times on the program, that the entire content of the play was entirely fictitious.
It was so real.
And what were their reactions?
Well, many laughed, with perhaps just a touch of historical relief in their laughter.
Course not.
I knew it was a play all the time.
You know what I mean.
My-- my sister passed out.
All the kids were screaming their heads off.
The whole house was in an uproar.
Is that what you call entertainment?
Say, what are you gonna do about me?
Where am I calling from?
But there is one thing we must not overlook.
All this took place in 1938 in a less sophisticated yesteryear that did not know the atom bomb guided missiles and rockets that may shortly fly to the moon.
20 years ago, the concept of an alien race was novel to us, hence.
Alarming.
Today we realize that Mars is very near, closer perhaps in time than we imagined.
There is every reason to believe that long before the Martians come to us, we will go to them.

Ha-ha.
Do you see the model house, Mr. Mason?
Yes.
Well, now look at the swimming pool.
Now do you see the girl?
She go with the model house?
No, Mr. Mason.
She goes with my husband.
You come up here quite often, Mrs. Granger?
No, not wrong.
Just very cruel to yourself.
I thought so too at first.
I never knew that hate had a taste all of its own that kind of fills your throat and chokes you.
There are any number of good divorce lawyers.
I want Bruce.
No, just a woman who wants her husband.
What would you like me to do?
Do you see all this property, Mr. Mason?
Well, all this property belongs to the Sylvan Glade Development Company.
They think they found oil on the property now.
And if they find oil on the property, she gets half his profits.
Not bad.
I understand she has a very good friend in the company.
Apparently Miss Howard has thought of everything.
Not quite.
Not if I can get you to block the deal.
How do you expect me to do that?
By buying stock in the Sylvan Glade Company.
What if your husband finds out?
That would ruin everything.
Well, Mr. Mason?
But buying that stock could prove very expensive.
We wanna start the meeting.
Oh, Herbert.
Will you come on out here so we can get down to business?
Sorry.
I was just getting the minutes in order.
Well, now, before Herbert reads the minutes of our Sylvan Glade Development Company,
I have a couple of announcements to make.
We also have another guest, Mr. Perry Mason.
Mr. Mason has bought some of my stock in the corporation.
The stock is in my name.
Oh, Sam Elkins.
Business that means money in all our pockets.
I was under the impression you were going to subdivide that county property for tract houses.
And how do we know there really is oil?
Most speculative.
I move we proceed at once to exploit the mineral and oil rights of our tract number 136.
Wait, before you vote, better have a look at your corporate bylaws, Paragraph 2, Section 16.
I am unalterably opposed to the business now before this board.
Good day, gentlemen.
Can he do this to us?
How much did he pay you for those shares?
Suppose there is no oil?
Yes.
Listen to me, Mr. Mason.
I need that stock.
Hello?
Mr. Mason.
Hello?
Hello?
Come on, eat your dinner before it gets cold.
What does the man want?
Oh, so you had to buy steak at $1.34 a pound.
Do you have to bleed me dry?
Oh, you keep out of this.
Everybody tries to take advantage of me.
You, Elkins, Mason.
Oh, some nonsense about wanting to keep the property clear for development.
Ha.
You ever seen Mason hanging around?
What about Mrs. Granger, Herbert?
Sybil Granger?
Forget it.
She watches it with binoculars.
Wait a minute.
Herbert has seen him.
Keep it warm.
Why not?
At least it got his mind off the steak.
Hello, Sam?
George Lutts.
No, no.
Now, listen.
You have bank connections.
Find out if Mason deposited a cheque from Mrs. Bruce Granger.
Mrs. Bruce Granger.
Enjoying the view?
My company owns all this property.
How do you do?
You interested in acquiring a piece of land?
Mind if I look?
Mm, no, nothing much to see today.
Maybe tomorrow, though.
Mr. Lutts, why did you come up here?
The way I see it, he bought those shares for you.
I want them back.
And also that you--
Mr. Lutts.
Taxi.
Help me!
Mr. Mason.
I just wanted to get away from there as fast as I could.
I ran down to the highway.
Did you keep your taxi receipt?
Uh...
Yes, I think I did.
The Skyline Cab Company.
Trip number 971, $2.95.
I gave the driver a 55-cent tip.
Do you own a gun?
Yes.
My husband collects them and he gave me one.
Where is it?
Where is that gun now?
I left it in the glove compartment.
But I thought I left it there.
If you pick someone to lie to, Mrs. Granger, never choose your doctor or your lawyer.
In both cases, it could be fatal.
Hello?
Yes, Paul.
Good.
What about the cab?
Now, what about that friend of yours, Ruth, uh--?
With your life?
Come in, partner.
The cab is in the left lane.
Stay with him.
If that cab turns west, it could be trouble.
Good.
Stay with him.
One of our men just got into that cab.
Passing Hillcrest.
Still on Santa Monica.
Hello, Mrs. Granger.
Get ready.
Cab 761.
Should be there any minute.
Ruth, that taxi should be here any minute.
Fine.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Where to, miss?
You just drive down Sunset.
No matter what you do, Mrs. Granger, hold on to this taxi receipt.
I want the police to find it right off the bat.
I understand.
Excuse me.
Oh, of course.
Send him right in.
Good morning, lieutenant.
As if you had no idea.
What do you know about George Lutts?
Oh, yes, Lutts.
There was a gun nearby.
It was registered in the name of Bruce Granger.
For several hours.
He was very vague.
Bruce gave it to me.
It was my gun.
It was my gun.
The State of California v. Sybil Granger.
Your Honour, this present case is perfectly simple and straightforward.
And if we can avoid endless and purposeless cross-examination, this preliminary hearing can be quickly resolved.
Do you wish to make any statement, Mr. Mason?
None whatever, Your Honour.
Proceed.
I will call Lieutenant Tragg.
Now, lieutenant, were you present when the defendant was arrested?
Yes, by a police matron, though I went through her purse myself.
Keys, money, cigarettes and a taxi receipt from the Skyline Cab Company.
Is this the receipt?
If the court please, I should like this marked for exhibit.
Now, lieutenant, I notice this is dated May 3rd.
And did you examine the body
How far would you say the gun was held from the victim at the time the fatal shot was fired?
Well, between, um, 18, 20 inches.
Certainly under two feet.
How do you determine that?
Well, by the powder tattooing on the skin and the dispersion of powder particles in the clothing.
Thank you, sir.
You may cross-examine.
Why did you tell me that shot came from a distance?
It did.
Do you intend to cross-examine this witness, Mr. Mason?
No questions, Your Honour.
Call Jerome Keddie.
Raise your right hand.
Could you tell us your occupation, Mr. Keddie?
On the third day of this month, were you operating taxicab number 761 ?
I was.
And where were you at about 4:45 on the afternoon of that day?
Well, I was running back empty towards the city from out near the new freeway area on the county highway.
A woman flagged me down.
She sure was nervous and upset.
I ask you to look around this courtroom and tell us if that woman is here.
There she is.
Let the record show that the witness pointed to the defendant,
Sybil Granger.
Now, Mr. Keddie.
Where did you take Mrs. Granger?
To the Brent Building in Los Angeles.
It shows the trip number, that it was my cab
Your witness.
Now, Mr. Keddie.
Would you mind explaining what that means?
Well, we have to keep a record of all of the fares we pick up.
Mr. Keddie, this trip sheet is dated the 3rd of May.
This passenger you picked up on the highway, the one you claim was the defendant, that was one of your first trips of the day?
Oh, it was the third.
Number 971.
I see.
How does it happen, then, that this receipt, the receipt you gave the defendant, is for trip number 984?
Wait a minute.
Let me see that thing.
The court would like to look at those papers too, Mr. Prosecutor.
Well, Mr. Keddie, I notice that trip number 984 on your sheet is one which you have marked the destination to be Whittier and Wilshire.
Oh, I remember that trip.
A couple of ladies I picked up on Sunset.
So I drove them around until, all of a sudden, one of them says:
So I stopped.
They got out and paid off.
Was one of those women this defendant?
Well, you know how it is.
You pick up a lot of people.
No.
Mr. Prosecutor, you must admit that the testimony of this witness has become hopelessly impaired.
You would hardly be in a position to put him in front of a jury to make an absolute identification.
And I intend to find out.
Well, not unless you have additional evidence.
The testimony of this witness has been destroyed.
All right, Your Honour, then I move that this hearing be dismissed while I get additional evidence.
Motion is granted.
Court is adjourned.
Did you notice?
He left a vapour trail.
You told me that shot came from a distance.
If he said there were powder burns, why, there were powder--
Well, speak of the devil.
Congratulations, Mason.
A brilliant performance.
Oh, really?
I thought Burger did all right.
Now, I ask you, Tragg.
He charged my client with murder and never established one link between her and the victim.
You mind if I think that over for a minute?
How you can delay us until Burger shows up with his warrant.
What--?
Whatever gave you that impression?
Well, for one thing, that deputy coming toward us right now.
What...?
Oh, you mean this.
Matron, Mrs. Granger is being held for another hearing.
Well, see you later, counsellor.
Sybil.
Please, my husband.
I must go now.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Come on, Della.
This is the spot, Perry.
See Della?
Those are all the keys my father-in-law had.
That was a Master padlock on that shack, Perry.
As a matter of fact, there is.
Did your father-in-law have any enemies?
Not everyone liked him.
Do you think Herbert enjoyed working for my father?
He had better offers every day of the week.
You know why he stuck?
To please me.
How could you, Mr. Mason?
Sick about money.
Who was twisted every which way whenever he had to spend a nickel.
But he was my father and Herbert stayed with him to please me.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Dean.
Come on, Della.
Excuse me.
Beautiful pair of glasses.
Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?
Uh-huh.
One of my men found them in a ditch.
Not far from where Lutts was shot.
Notice the initials there.
Oh, but all over.
I wonder how Mr. Mason will explain that at the next hearing.
Mr. Redfield, let me understand you.
Yes, sir, and it was registered in the name of Bruce Granger.
One of the cartridges was a Peters .38
Special.
The other one was a U.M.C. That was the last one fired.
Now, as ballistics expert for this department, you checked the fatal bullet to determine from which weapon it had been fired.
I did.
It was fired from that gun.
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Mr. Redfield, you stated there were two shots fired from the murder weapon.
The first one.
The Peters .38
Special.
Well, what happened to the bullet from the second shot, the U.M.C.?
We were unable to find that bullet.
It went wild.
You want us to believe that the defendant stood less than two feet away from the victim, hit him with the first shot and completely missed him with the second?
You can interpret them any way you want.
Now, suppose the first bullet, the bullet that killed Lutts, was fired from a distance.
Suppose the second shot was a blank.
That would explain the powder burns, Mr. Mason, but we could establish what happened in a second.
Oh?
How?
A blank cartridge has a paper wadding to hold the powder in place.
The coroner would find it in the wound.
It can go through thick cardboard.
Then it should certainly penetrate fabric.
Without question.
Very interesting.
Your Honour, does counsel for the defence presume to know more about ballistics than Mr. Redfield, a recognised expert?
I see no harm in this experiment, Mr. Burger.
Proceed, Mr. Mason.
Now, Mr. Redfield, would you tell the court what this is, please.
Well, would it fit this gun, the murder weapon?
It should.
Would you load it for me, please?
Thank you.
Now, Mr. Redfield, if I were to--
Oh, excuse me.
If I were to fire this blank into this fabric, what would happen?
Your Honour, I object.
Counsel for defence is up to his usual grandstanding.
I demand to know how that trick was accomplished.
Overruled.
It is not incumbent on Mr. Mason to reveal how this trick was managed.
Have you any further questions of this witness?
No, Your Honour.
The witness is excused.
All right, sir.
My next witness is a hostile witness.
I have her under subpoena and I would like to call her at this time, out of order, for reasons which I shall show later.
Very well, you may call the witness.
Mrs. Ruth Marvel.
Now, keep a poker face.
Raise your right hand.
I do.
Yes, sir.
Objection, Your Honour.
Counsel is cross-examining his own witness.
May I be heard?
If the court please, I believe this witness will testify to a damaging admission on the part of the defendant.
The objection will be overruled.
All right, Mrs. Marvel, answer the question.
She said it was a cab she had taken earlier in the day.
She said--
She said what, Mrs. Marvel?
I must insist on your answer.
She said her lawyer had told her to take this cab, to have me ride around with her and pay him off when the meter got to $2.95.
Would you recognise that cab driver if you saw him again?
Is that the man, Mrs. Marvel?
Yes.
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Now, the cab driver did not recognise her, did he?
At least, he showed no sign of recognition that you could see?
No, sir.
We were simply attempting to test the credibility of a witness.
Thank you.
No further questions, Your Honour.
Very well, the court is adjourned until tomorrow morning.
Over here, Perry.
My man saw her do it.
What the devil?
Paul, let me get this straight.
Your man saw Roxy Howard take a lot of junk out of here and toss it into the gully in back of her place?
He made a complete inventory.
There were some small sandbags, a few clamps, some pieces of iron pipe, 2-by-4s and, oh, yeah, a stool.
He showed me everything before he left.
Come on, Perry.
Wait a minute.
It was right here.
Get hold of your operative.
Have him describe every pipe and wood that he saw.
Duplicate it and bring it to my workshop tonight.
Thank you very much, sir.
The defence may proceed.
I call as my first witness Bruce Granger.
Bruce Granger to the stand.
Mr. Granger, what is your relationship with the defendant?
Of course.
Tell me.
Do you know a Miss Roxy Howard?
Yes.
And what is your relationship with Miss Howard?
Well, we were friends.
I see.
Did you ever give Miss Howard a revolver from your collection?
Answer the question, please.
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Oh?
Do you, uh, have any record showing the serial numbers of your various guns?
Yes.
Mr. Granger, where do you keep your gun collection?
In a locked wall compartment concealed behind a sliding panel.
And I have the only key.
What is this?
I must beg the indulgence of the court.
But as part of my case, it is necessary for me to introduce in evidence some material discarded by one of the--
This is a disturbance we cannot tolerate.
You should have waited until the court takes a recess.
Wait there until counsel has finished the examination of this witness.
Then the court will take a brief recess.
It seems to me, Mr. Mason, that you could have secured a more silent truck.
Proceed.
If the court permit, I wish this witness be instructed to check his list of serial numbers with the guns now in his possession.
And after the recess, I want him to produce that list.
The witness is so instructed.
Perhaps we can also use the time to move that truck.
The court will recess until 11:30.
Did you have to make me use this old truck?
Nothing like a little noise to upset jittery nerves.
We are laying a trap for a nervous accomplice.
HO YT:
The court will come to order.
Mr. Bruce Granger to the stand.
Could that weapon have been the gun
Miss Howard returned to you on May 30th?
HO YT:
Cross-examination?
Not at this time, Your Honour.
I might want to recall him later, if I may do that.
I have no objection in the least.
Will Miss Roxy Howard come forward, please?
Miss Roxy Howard.
Come forward and be sworn.
Did you ever give that gun to someone else?
Well, is Mr. Granger lying, or was there a substitution?
Once or twice.
Did you ever notice any unusual equipment?
Equipment that had nothing to do with the building construction.
Miss Howard, you ever seen this before?
If Your Honour please, what possible connection can there be between that--
Whatever it is.
If Your Honour please, this is exactly the field we should be in and I can prove it.
Proceed.
Miss Howard.
Have you ever seen that before?
No.
Perhaps you saw it in a different condition.
Taken apart, just pipes and wood.
Do you know what a shooting stand is?
In this case, braced by sandbags.
The person using the gun merely lays his arm in the rest, holds the barrel on a direct line with the target, then all he has to do is simply pull the trigger.
It had to be someone or some object on the hilltop.
The hilltop is the only place in a direct line with a certain hole in the wall of that construction shack.
There were only two people on that hilltop.
George Lutts and Sybil Granger.
But you were certain Mrs. Granger would be.
Why did you take that shooting stand apart
But you were seen, Miss Howard.
Where do you think this came from?
Now, I ask you again, Miss Howard.
Why did you take that shooting stand apart?
You must have had some reason.
Did you do it to protect yourself?
No one.
Did you tell someone you had dismantled the stand?
Oh, no, Miss Howard.
Someone else did that.
What you see here is purely for the purpose of demonstration.
The actual dismantled stand is in a garage not very far away from here.
Uh...
During the recess, the owner of that garage even ran home to make sure the stand was there.
He wanted to see if I was bluffing.
Well, it was there.
But he had no opportunity to warn you that I built that stand myself.
Mr. Granger gave you a gun.
The weapon used to murder George Lutts.
You returned a different gun.
You knew Mrs. Granger was going to be on that hilltop.
You took a shooting stand apart, destroying evidence.
If you are not trying to protect someone,
Uh...
It was an accident.
It was Mrs. Granger.
She was supposed to be the one.
You mean, you deliberately aimed at Mrs. Granger and Lutts got in the way?
What are you sitting there for, letting me take the blame?
Come up here, tell them.
He did it.
Herbert.
Herbert Dean.
It was his idea.
He wanted to get rid of Mrs. Granger.
She was the only one blocking the oil deal.
Vinnie, wait, please.
Let go of me.
Bailiff, hold that man.
I would have made a million dollars.
He did it.
It was all his idea.
Here, she takes the guy back after she almost gets herself killed because of him.
Lutts was the target from the start.
Yeah, but Roxy said that--
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
It belongs to Mr. Mason.
He introduced it in evidence.
And what are we supposed to do with this pile of junk?
The city rubbish collection has strict orders not to pick up trash like this.
Now, I want to be reasonable, Perry.
I can handle the whole thing.
For a fee.
But the DA is a friend of mine.
Oh...
Get me out of here before I use this on myself.
Are you sure you gave Mr. Davenport the right address?
Positive.
Do you know the circumstances under which this food was prepared?
What did you find in--?
Come in.
Mr. Davenport, this is Dr. Mitchell.
Arsenic.
But then arsenic worked for her before, so why change, right?
Who you talking about?
My wife.
Mind your own business, Louise.
Coming, dear.
Packed your bag.
You can still make Bakerstown before--
You hypocrite.
Telling me not to drink, to listen to the doctor.
Those sandwiches you packed for my trip last week, they were loaded with arsenic.
Ed, what are you trying to do to her?
Ask your precious cousin about Uncle Charlie.
Here, read it for yourself.
Straight to the gas chamber.
Remember that.
Ed.
Hello?
Yes, sir?
This is Mr. Davenport in Cabin 6.
Dr. Renault.
Well, get him over here right away.
Come in.
Hello.
This is Dr. Frank Renault.
Is there any message?
Can you get in touch with her?
Her husband is very ill.
Are you related to Mrs. Davenport?
Yes.
Well, frankly, madam, the situation is critical.
Hello?
Thank you so much for calling.
Goodbye.
Garden Club.
Arrangements Committee again.
Oh.
I thought it might be Ed.
Ohh.
When are you going to start thinking about yourself?
What kind of a husband is it who writes letters accusing his wife of poisoning him?
I think he was just talking.
Was he?
I bet he has it all written down.
It might even include his notion you killed Uncle Charles.
For your own good, you ought to see a lawyer.
Do it just to please me.
Of course, Mr. Mason, coming here was my idea.
I was afraid that if anything happened to Ed, that letter might get into the hands of the police.
Why should something happen to him?
Well, the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
We never know when our time is up.
This, um Uncle Charles your husband has accused you of poisoning, did he leave you any money?
How much?
A great deal.
And to see Ed run through it would just make you sick.
That letter could be damaging.
And this is the key to his office with the address on the tag.
As long as Mr. Davenport is alive, I have no right to touch that letter.
Well...
Louise, that telephone call that came just before we left the house was from a Dr. Renault.
The Vista Motel on San Fernando Road.
Go with her.
Let me know if something happens.
Traffic gets bad this time of day.
As you can see, he is too weak to be moved to a hospital.
I thought it best to keep him here.
My...
My wife.
Put poison in candy.
Save your strength, Mr. Davenport.
He says he became ill after eating some chocolates.
I hope this convinces you that going to Mr. Mason was doing the right thing.
Poison in the candy.
I packed this candy with his clothes the way I always do.
I ate a piece myself.
Doctor.
Nothing wrong here.
Lift the plastic.
You wait here, honey.
How do you plan to get in there?
Davenport wanted that letter found by the police easily.
This is it.
Does it belong to the widow or the authorities?
Yeah.
The entry was in a feminine hand.
Shall I get it?
Hello.
Unit 13.
Desert Motel.
Bakerstown.
Hello?
Hello?
All he said was Unit 13, Desert Motel, Bakerstown.
I wonder what it could possibly mean?
Make a note.
Call the Drake Detective Agency.
Send Paul up there to investigate.
First thing tomorrow?
First thing tonight.
I guess this does it.
Invisible ink?
No.
Lieutenant Tragg, Homicide.
You Dr. Renault?
Yes, lieutenant.
The victim-- Rather, my patient.
He said his wife poisoned him.
The young one.
Oh, it was a heart attack.
Who has the key?
I wonder why he put blank pages in there?
Could be a trap to make the police think we removed incriminating evidence.
Sounds like someone has already sprung the trap.
Good evening, officer.
This my secretary, Miss Street.
What are you doing here?
This is my authorization.
You want that letter.
He wrote a letter to the police in case he died.
Please, get it.
Just a minute, officer.
I had no intention of opening, sir.
Answer it.
Hello?
Oh.
Thank you.
Hello?
Mr. Mason, something terrible has happened.
Yes, I know.
I spoke with Miss Ansel earlier.
What happened?
All right.
Goodbye.
I think that concludes our business, officer.
Shall we go?
Is he alive?
Such as?
Taking charge of an estate before there was an estate.
Some people might think I was overzealous.
The district attorney included?
The district attorney included.
So this man calls from L.A. last night.
He give me the name of Stokes.
John Stokes.
Of course, how many gives their real names?
And what am I supposed to be, a human lie detector or something?
He did send you the money for the cabin?
Sure, 5 bucks by telegraph.
He said to hold Number 13 till midnight tonight.
Business is business, I say.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, you know, I used to be a nurse.
Practical, but not registered.
Ha-ha-ha.
The cap, you know.
He talked to me over an hour ago.
He was looking for Stokes too.
Does the name John Stokes mean anything to you?
John Stokes?
No.
It might.
My investigator went to Bakerstown last night.
in making a reservation at a motel there.
Mr. Mason, I wanna thank you while I have a chance.
Well, hello, counsellor.
All right, Tragg.
Just a few questions.
Well, maybe she can tell us something about her uncle.
You work pretty fast.
There was nothing wrong.
Uncle Charles died of pleurisy.
Coroner said it was arsenic poisoning.
I was with--
Lieutenant?
Found this in the garage.
Hmm.
Sixty-two percent arsenic.
Would you know anything about this, Mrs. Davenport?
I use that to spray plants.
No.
You could take care of him yourself.
Miss Ansel, I must-- LOUISE:
What a fool I was.
When Ed showed me that report from the lab,
Go on, Miss Ansel.
You were saying?
Ed brought back a report yesterday from the Pacific Laboratories.
It proved there was arsenic in some sandwiches that Myrna made for him.
All along I thought Ed was crazy.
But you killed Uncle Charles just the way you killed him.
With a witness like this, how can he lose?
I wanna believe you, Mrs. Davenport, very much.
But there are lot of things here that are unexplained.
What was your husband doing with that candy?
The doctor told him to eat some any time he felt the urge to drink.
I see.
Only this batch happened to be loaded with arsenic.
I know.
And your fingerprints happened to be on the box.
Well, he died of arsenic poisoning.
As far as we know, her husband is still alive.
What about the statement of Miss Ansel?
The outburst of an hysterical woman.
All right, Mrs. Davenport.
I can get home alone.
As one attorney to another,
Can you deny that you steamed this open and replaced the original contents?
Who gave you the right to open that?
Hello.
Hold it.
It says right on the envelope,
Exactly.
Dr. Renault.
Hello.
Yes.
You have?
Where?
Great work, Tragg.
You go ahead.
Get in touch with the morgue right away.
Dr. Renault identified the body.
The father put in the call.
He runs the gas station down the highway.
Mr. Medford?
Mr. Medford, this is District Attorney Burger and Mr. Mason.
How did your boys happen to find the body?
Well, uh, they found the grave first.
Tuesday afternoon.
Looked like one of them slit trenches, only deeper.
You know how kids are.
Yesterday, they played here again.
Then this morning, it was filled up.
They dug some, then came a-calling for me.
I see.
Thanks, Mr. Medford.
Lieutenant.
Excuse me.
Radio call from the coroner.
He finish the preliminary autopsy?
It was arsenic.
All right, Tragg.
You know what to do.
I understand the husband mistreated her and--
All right, Mason.
You destroyed vital evidence to protect your client.
You are pretty enough without that.
All right, Paul, what is it this time?
Why, Grandma, what a suspicious mind you have.
Is the boss in?
No, he went over to see Mrs. Davenport.
Mm.
Remember me telling you about a guy watching Unit 13
I got a hold of his licence number before he took off.
And this is the gentleman in question?
Mm-hm.
Not much.
He, uh, runs a small detective agency.
I wonder what he was doing.
Yes, Gertie?
Speak of the devil.
Mr. Jason Beckmeyer himself.
Oh, I wanted to see Mason.
Well, he represents Mrs. Davenport.
What kind of work?
Davenport wanted me to keep an eye on The Desert Motel in Bakerstown.
He just said I should watch Unit 13.
It was reserved by a man named Stokes.
Did you see Mr. Stokes?
Yeah.
He came in late that night.
He was driving a white sports car.
I got a good look at him while he was talking to the manager.
What did he want?
No kidding?
Did you get a description?
Yes.
Yes, Gertie?
Don Gregory.
New man I just put on.
Yes, Don.
Uh-huh.
Right away.
Lieutenant Tragg said everyone should stay away.
That was my impression.
Nothing to be afraid of.
I came to get my personal things.
Including those papers?
They were in my desk.
I think the district attorney might find this rather peculiar.
Mr. Davenport seems to have sold a few of his investments recently.
He sold all of them a few months ago.
No.
You withdrew over $17,000 yesterday.
What business is it of yours?
The Davenport estate is in my hands.
I realise how busy you are, lieutenant, but do you think you could possibly spare me just a few minutes?
You got something on your mind?
Yes, I think you ought to check Rita Norge again.
Well, I did.
Mr. Davenport ask her to drop by.
He was going to phone the office and tell her where to go.
You know what I mean.
You believe that story?
Listen, the day Ed Davenport was at the Vista Motel, someone withdrew $17,300 from his checking account.
Now, who do you suppose that someone was?
Rita Norge?
I think she was planning to leave town with the money.
Yeah.
Miss Norge was in yesterday afternoon.
What do you suppose she wanted?
Miss Ansel.
Yes?
You called my office this morning.
Yes, I wanted to see you.
Well?
Could you come to my house this evening?
Here is my address.
Thank you.
And in your capacity as deputy coroner for this county, you performed an autopsy on the body of the deceased, Edward Davenport?
I did.
What did you find, Dr. Hoxie?
After making certain tests,
I detected the presence of a specific poison, arsenic.
Would you please tell the court, doctor, what conclusions you draw from this.
There is no doubt that death was caused by stoppage of the heart, due in turn to ingestion of the poison.
Do you have an opinion as to how the poison was administered?
Through food the victim ate an hour before his death.
Yes, although the poison would have caused his death in 12 hours in any event.
Did you test the body for blood alcohol?
I did.
It contain 0.15 percent of alcohol.
Then the arsenic could have been administered in a drink?
I beg your pardon.
I said nothing of the sort.
I said I felt that the poison had been introduced through the food.
Well, the victim ingested a meal of bacon and eggs approximately an hour before his death.
Thank you, doctor.
I will now call Dr. Frank Renault.
Dr. Renault to the stand, please.
You may step down.
Thank you.
I got to his cabin around noon.
Did he say where he got the chocolates?
He said his wife bought them for him.
How do you account for the fact the coroner found no chocolate in the body?
I immediately pumped his stomach.
I see.
Your witness.
At exactly 15 minutes past 5 p.m.
I did.
One thing puzzles me, doctor.
Well, how do you account for the fact that Dr. Hoxie found traces of bacon and eggs eaten approximately an hour before death?
Well, uh...
Dr. Hoxie has Mr. Davenport sitting down to bacon and eggs while you have him in an oxygen tent.
In order to investigate that situation further
I request an adjournment till tomorrow morning.
Does the defence have any objections?
Very well.
You may step down.
The case is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Check Dr. Renault back to the day he hung out his shingle.
All right.
Will you drop this by the office for me?
Where you going?
I can think of more picturesque places.
According to those kids, this grave was prepared in advance.
Who would have known Davenport was gonna get sick and have to call a doctor?
And who would have known he was gonna die?
His secretary?
Why not?
True.
What are you looking for?
The coroner said that Davenport had eaten bacon and eggs before he died.
Hmm.
We passed a diner about seven or eight miles back.
Can you see him walking in there in pyjamas?
What about a modern version of the same?
A house trailer?
I, uh...
I always talk too much.
Most people do.
I know who killed Ed.
Then I suggest you go to the police.
It was that secretary.
That Rita Norge.
Where do you suppose all the money went?
What money?
Well, my Uncle Charles left Myrna over $280,000.
She has less than $40,000 left.
He gave it to that woman to hold for him.
Over $200,000.
How do you suppose we can prove it?
We?
You ought to know about these things.
How do we get the police to question her?
You mean you would--?
Well, you want them to question her.
If they found arsenic they would.
That all depends on how you look at it.
If Miss Norge is guilty, we have just put the police on the right track.
Of course, you know this kind of operation runs into money.
Just wanna try to make it up to Myrna.
Hm.
Tell me, Miss Ansel, where do you get your ideas about private detectives?
From the movies?
But this was your idea.
Perry.
Perry, over here.
Crankcase oil.
A car must have stood here for some time.
Well?
Nice work, Della.
This is it.
Will the court please rise?
Be seated.
Dr. Renault to the stand, please.
You were sworn in yesterday, sir.
Dr. Renault, when was the first time you were called in to treat Mr. Davenport?
On Wednesday around noon.
Who called you in?
The owner of the Vista Motel.
He said one of his guests was ill.
Are you the only doctor in the neighbourhood?
Yes, sir.
I live just around the corner.
Had you ever seen Mr. Davenport before you were called in?
Had he ever consulted you at your office?
Not that I recall.
Now, had you ever seen Mr. Davenport before you treated him at the Vista Motel?
I...
I may have.
For what purpose?
You ought to know that the conversation between a doctor and a patient is privileged.
Did he tell you then that he wanted to die or rather that he wanted to have it appear that he had died?
I repeat, the communication between a doctor and a patient is privileged.
Very well.
Now, uh, doctor, will you please tell the court what medical degree you hold and from what institution?
Doctor of Health Medicine.
Jackson State Medical College.
Where is this college located?
Was the school accredited to any medical association?
I refuse to answer on the ground it would tend to incriminate me.
That certainly is your constitutional right.
My man will be here.
Mr. Beckmeyer.
Raise your right hand.
Be seated and state your name.
Jason Beckmeyer.
Mr. Beckmeyer, you are a licensed private investigator?
You were employed in that capacity by the late Edward Davenport?
I was.
Did he ever ask you to locate a doctor for him who was not a member of the American Medical Association?
He did.
He wanted me to find a quack who had an office near a motor court.
And you found a man who met those requirements?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Renault.
Did you make the appointment with Dr. Renault?
No, no.
Davenport took care of that himself.
Would you happen to remember the date of that meeting?
Yeah, it was February 7th.
Exactly one week before Mr. Davenport died.
No, sir.
No, I stayed in the car.
What other services did you render Mr. Davenport?
Well, when he wanted a reputable laboratory to do food analysis,
I put him in touch with Pacific Labs.
Did you ever act as dummy for various bank accounts so that Davenport could juggle funds belonging to his wife?
But you did allow yourself to be used for the purpose of opening several bank accounts?
Yes, I did.
Were you at any time engaged by Davenport to drive him out of the country?
No, sir.
I have here a statement from the Department of Motor Vehicles which indicates that you own a house trailer.
Was the late Edward Davenport ever in that trailer?
No, no.
Never.
If an expert were to produce fingerprints,
Well, he might have been in there once.
Oh, no.
Then where did he get the bacon and eggs?
And where did he get the liquor?
None was found in his room.
You gave it to him, did you not?
Generously spiked with arsenic.
Then answer this, Mr. Beckmeyer.
If you did not kill Davenport why did you dig that grave two days in advance?
Yeah.
Well, the chump was asking for it.
Never got tired of telling me how smart he was.
He was gonna disappear and leave his wife holding the bag.
Everybody would wonder what happened to the body.
It was such a great plan
I figured with a little help from me, it would be perfect.
Guess I was wrong too, huh?
Just a little bit more to the right.
I hear there was almost 200 grand in his trailer.
Two hundred and ten to be exact.
You know, the thing that puzzles me is Uncle Charlie.
He wanted his wife to be an heiress.
So he could steal her blind and then disappear.
Mm-hm.
He was the guiding genius of the plot.
That call was obviously for Rita Norge.
Yeah?
She had over $17,000 belonging to Davenport, remember?
If Davenport did make the call, why then--
Then Beckmeyer must have.
He wanted to get his hot little hands on the money.
So Beckmeyer was responsible for those blank pages in the letter.
And a very provocative one.
He made sure the police would believe that letter had been tampered with.
Well, you gotta give Davenport credit.
Just a case of a slightly crooked frame.
Good evening.
First, I would like to announce a change in our program.
All those corpses, you know.
Most of our stories have taken place in the United States or one of the other colonies.
But tonight we offer a new locale.
is laid in a far-off land of mystery and enchantment.
England.
And now suppose you continue squinting at this little screen while I slip into something more uncomfortable.
No, thank you.
Well, here I am.
Is that you, Herbert?
Well, now, who did you think it was, your gentleman friend?
Oh, Herbert!
Kippers.
Kippers would be just the thing on a night like this.
Well, all right, then.
Your slippers are in here waiting for you.
My feet are killing me.
Oh, hello!
Herbert?
Here!
I said stop it!
Both of them...
Here, let me...
...and not a single witness.
Now then, now then, now then, keep back, everybody.
Outside the house, now.
Petersen!
Petersen.
Now, you have to keep it quiet.
Come on.
Outside, outside.
Come on, get back there.
Oh, all right, come in, come in.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go on home, go on home.
Yes, I live down the road a piece.
Who did it?
I searched the back premises, nothing there.
Not a trace.
All right.
See if you can find anyone nearby who saw anything or heard anything unusual.
Right-o!
Now, come on.
Get back.
What happened?
They were strangled, we know that much.
I was passing nearby and I saw the door open.
So I looked in and there they were, just like that.
Dead.
And not a few minutes before I found them either.
But no sign of who did it, and no sign of a struggle or anything like that.
Would your uncle keep any sums of money about the place?
Or anything of value like?
Not that I know of.
I could swear to that.
Very well.
Or anything at all out of the way?
You know, not like it ought to be.
Yes, all right.
Did you hear him come home or go into his house?
Call out to anybody?
No sound of a struggle?
Nothing at all, eh?
No, not a thing.
Me and the missus was in the back, you see, having our tea.
Say, what kind of a chap was he?
Did you know him at all well?
Lived next door to him for five years now.
Very quiet, dependable sort of fellow.
Everybody liked him.
Mmm-hmm.
Not anywhere at all.
No.
Not a sign.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
Must be.
Sergeant, remember me?
How did you get here so quickly?
I live around here.
Sorry no time for the press just at present, Sir.
Now, now.
Now then, stand back.
I am sorry, gentleman, that is all the information we have for you just at present.
Yes, I have.
The senseless wantonness of these killings has everybody talking about them.
So have I.
So you better produce some results, eh, Sergeant.
However, you may say that we expect to have something definite...
To report at an early date.
Now, see here, this only happened the night before last.
So you have made no progress then?
Buy a flower.
Buy a flower for your young lady, Sir,
All right.
Nearly closing time, Ben.
We ride in the dark tonight.
Last call for drinks.
Well, call that fair?
No good to complain to me about it.
I just have to turn in a story each day.
You or Scotland Yard.
Have you?
Time, gentleman.
Please drink up and pay up.
All out.
By the way,
I find it remarkable how you gentleman of the press arrived at the spot so quickly.
Good night, Sergeant.
Good night.
All right.
Buy a flower for the young lady, sir?
Good evening, Sir.
And I was having a bit of a rest
Good morning, Sergeant.
Have you seen The Guardian?
Thank you very much.
Mr. Summers, how about a cup of tea?
Thanks.
A little sugar if you please.
You know, I had a theory about this at the start.
The Whybrows, that is.
Since it seemed like there was no reason for killing them at all,
You see what I mean?
He made a mistake, thought he was killing somebody else, went to the wrong house or something.
Eh, Sarge?
Wonder what the motive could be?
Oh, there was a motive all right.
You can count on that.
There has to be a motive, you know.
No, no.
No.
Neil Cream for one.
And William Palmer for another, eh, Sergeant?
He was another.
Nothing so old-fashioned as a conscience bothers him, yet he has three murders to his credit.
and smiling to himself because the police are such fools.
Why not an Englishman?
Nor the talent for it either.
One of these foreign johnnies.
Yes.
Have you been around this district lately?
The people only talk about one subject.
Women do their shopping before dark and bolt their windows and doors at night.
This one man with a pair of hands has terrified this whole community and made them realize that the laws are powerful only so long as they are obeyed.
The police are potent so long as they are feared.
Would you say there were two men, Sergeant, like that?
Two men in the same place and at the same time?
This is a singular man.
A man who comes along once in a lifetime probably.
This one man with one pair of hands has held the entire police force and Scotland Yard helpless with nowhere to turn.
Part of it, at least.
It is?
But aside from that, what have you done?
What can you do?
You can bank on that.
What then?
He will.
They always do.
What about Dr. Crippen?
And George Joseph Smith?
Aye, I have.
Well, those people killed and were discovered only years afterwards by accident or belated confession.
Now, there must be many others who have never been discovered.
Now, you say the murderer is always caught because all the ones we know of have been caught.
But think of the others.
You seem to have made a great study of crime, Mr. Newspaperman.
I have.
Oh, aye.
Because we have to.
And now we have four men where we usually have one.
We are just hoping he will try again.
I see.
Of course, he might try somewhere else the next time.
But he might just be the type of man who would like to show us he could kill again beneath our noses and still get away with it.
Hmm?
Bye for now.
Good day.
Well, hello there, Jimmy.
Would you like to go across?
Right then, here we go.
Here we are.
Now, up.
Well?
Not a thing.
Keep a sharp lookout every second.
I only spoke to Petersen.
It was 9:32 by my watch.
And you found him at 9:35.
What happened?
Another one?
Yes.
Got one of their own men this time.
Johnson, take over.
Make way.
Make way, now.
You heard nothing?
You saw no sign of anybody at all?
Nobody.
Nobody.
Not a blinking soul.
Except Jimmy, the blind bootblack.
Nothing, until...
But it must have happened right under your nose, man.
Not seconds after you left him.
Blimey, Sarge, he must live hereabouts.
But where?
Where?
Nobody saw, nobody heard, nothing.
All right.
You and the others spread out.
Search all the buildings on both sides of the street.
Question everybody.
Pull them out of bed if need be.
Look into cupboards and behind curtains.
Here we are, Sir.
Thank you, Ben.
Things have come to a pretty pass and no mistake.
Any time now.
What makes you so certain?
See?
What will you have, sir?
Same as usual.
All right.
Man, beast or devil.
Unbalanced somehow.
Possibly.
Probably.
Something obvious.
Something right in front of us.
Like the ham in that sandwich.
How did it get there, by the by?
Well, somebody put it there, I dare say.
Yes.
Somebody did.
Sergeant?
Is that you, Sergeant?
Yes.
Well, seen anything of the murderer?
No, nor has anybody else.
I doubt if they ever will.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Came to me all of a sudden, just a little while ago.
Oh, has it?
We were talking in the bar now about things that are staring us in the face.
Like the ham in a sandwich, you know.
We never wonder how it got there.
And that was it.
Now, if four people have been murdered, somebody must have been there to murder them, you see.
Well, of course someone was there.
We all know that.
Question is, who?
Yes.
The answer seems so simple now.
I mean, the motive.
As man to man, tell me, Sergeant Ottermole,
just why did you kill those inoffensive people?
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Newspaperman,
Ideas come without our asking.
Why?
Huh?
And ideas could come into those parts all of a sudden like ideas come into
my hands?
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Yes.
I never saw anything so quick or anyone so strong.
I thought I was done for, for a moment.
I know.
We were following as close as we dared.
The sergeant.
His hands were like iron.
Yes, his hands.
Did you hear what he said about his hands?
He said ideas came into his hands.
He must have been insane.
Yes
I suppose so.
Ow!
Stop it!
Stop it!
And you be ready, too.
Good evening.
First, I would like to announce a change in our program.

Nothing at all, eh?
No, not a thing.
Me and the missus was in the back, you see, having our tea.
Say, what kind of a chap was he?
Did you know him at all well?
Lived next door to him for five years now.
Very quiet, dependable sort of fellow.
Everybody liked him.
Mmm-hmm.
Not anywhere at all.
No.
Not a sign.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
Must be.
Sergeant, remember me?
How did you get here so quickly?
I live around here.
Sorry no time for the press just at present, Sir.
Now, now.
Now then, stand back.
I am sorry, gentleman, that is all the information we have for you just at present.
Yes, I have.
The senseless wantonness of these killings has everybody talking about them.
So have I.
So you better produce some results, eh, Sergeant.
However, you may say that we expect to have something definite...
To report at an early date.
Now, see here, this only happened the night before last.
So you have made no progress then?
Buy a flower.
Buy a flower for your young lady, Sir,
All right.
Nearly closing time, Ben.
We ride in the dark tonight.
Last call for drinks.
Well, call that fair?
No good to complain to me about it.
I just have to turn in a story each day.
You or Scotland Yard.
Have you?
Time, gentleman.
Please drink up and pay up.
All out.
By the way,
I find it remarkable how you gentleman of the press arrived at the spot so quickly.
Good night, Sergeant.
Good night.
All right.
Buy a flower for the young lady, sir?
Good evening, Sir.
And I was having a bit of a rest
Good morning, Sergeant.
Have you seen The Guardian?
Thank you very much.
Mr. Summers, how about a cup of tea?
Thanks.
A little sugar if you please.
You know, I had a theory about this at the start.
The Whybrows, that is.
Since it seemed like there was no reason for killing them at all,
You see what I mean?
He made a mistake, thought he was killing somebody else, went to the wrong house or something.
Eh, Sarge?
Wonder what the motive could be?
Oh, there was a motive all right.
You can count on that.
There has to be a motive, you know.
No, no.
No.
Neil Cream for one.
And William Palmer for another, eh, Sergeant?
He was another.
Nothing so old-fashioned as a conscience bothers him, yet he has three murders to his credit.
and smiling to himself because the police are such fools.
Why not an Englishman?
Nor the talent for it either.
One of these foreign johnnies.
Yes.
Have you been around this district lately?
The people only talk about one subject.
Women do their shopping before dark and bolt their windows and doors at night.
This one man with a pair of hands has terrified this whole community and made them realize that the laws are powerful only so long as they are obeyed.
The police are potent so long as they are feared.
Would you say there were two men, Sergeant, like that?
Two men in the same place and at the same time?
This is a singular man.
A man who comes along once in a lifetime probably.
This one man with one pair of hands has held the entire police force and Scotland Yard helpless with nowhere to turn.
Part of it, at least.
It is?
But aside from that, what have you done?
What can you do?
You can bank on that.
What then?
He will.
They always do.
What about Dr. Crippen?
And George Joseph Smith?
Aye, I have.
Well, those people killed and were discovered only years afterwards by accident or belated confession.
Now, there must be many others who have never been discovered.
Now, you say the murderer is always caught because all the ones we know of have been caught.
But think of the others.
You seem to have made a great study of crime, Mr. Newspaperman.
I have.
Oh, aye.
Because we have to.
And now we have four men where we usually have one.
We are just hoping he will try again.
